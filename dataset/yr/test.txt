4 ||| Really satisfied with the manner in which Jeremy and team take care of our 3/4 acre yard. Prompt, thorough, knowledgeable, dependable, good communicator. We are very pleased.
3 ||| I have been wanting to check this place out for years, but I wanted it to be a stress free brunch.  This Sunday we had a sitter come in early and we headed to Old Town.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table outside, which is ok considering it is such a popular place.  While we waited, we purchased two Halloween cupcakes for the twins (they were not really great, no one ate them).  On the other side, breakfast was delicious. I started with the morning glory cocktail, bubbly, pineapple juice and cointreau.  It is a generous size, so I had to switch to a mimosa for my second one (good thing I was not driving).  I had the Menage with monkey cakes, wow the best pancake I have ever had.  The banana and coconut combination was so delicious,  I requested it without almonds (I don't have any allergies, I just didn't feel like having almonds).  Ryan was our server and he was very efficient and friendly.  My hubby had the green Flannel and a couple of different coffee drinks.  He loved his breakfast too.  Next time we will bring the twins.
1 ||| The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.
1 ||| Located on Fremont Street, and not far from Golden Nugget. This place probably seen better days. \n\nThe only reason why I go here, is for the cheap Deep Fried Twinkies in Las Vegas. Can't beat the 99 cents deep fried Twinkies. Even though, I know its not really good for me, but got to love the deep fried Twinkies. But, they could probably clean up the deep fry station and better customer service. Really didn't need some one telling me \"Don't forget my tip.\" With that remark, why would I tip you for being some what rude. But I guess 10% of a dollar, is probably all she'll get from me. \n\nBut the place itself, can probably look better, with out the slot machines that doesn't seem to work, time and time again. If the place was just a place to have a deep fried Twinkies and a slushy bar. Then it would be nice. But with the old school slot machines, and not so happy staff. I believe that this could of been a better place with a better review. \n\nIf you're into gambling or putting a quarter in a slot machine, this is not the place to do so, cause you'll probably not get any service or any help, probably in 30-60 minutes later. The slushy drinks and the deep fry station in the back, is probably a good place to get them.
0 ||| Had decent food, but shitty service. Never returning.
4 ||| So I told my friends I was coming back to visit them in Madison, but that's not exactly true.\n\nIt was really for the dumplings.\n\nAs a college SAFEwalker in the early oughts, little hole-in-the-wall Pel Meni served as my dinner often more than once per week.  $5 for a heaping plate of dumplings, sour cream, rye bread, and a soda was a ridiculous deal, and getting to spin records on the regs didn't hurt either.\n\nFast forward: shady business takeover::boycott::restaurant closes\n\nNearly a decade later, beloved original owner Paul reigns victorious. Re-opens cafe, and eventually re-opens right off State, now at Henry & Gorham.\n\nIs it a little more expensive now?  Sure.  But it's still $6.50 for over 50 dumplings, and $5 if you buy 'em frozen with all the fixin's, and it's open til 3am - genius.  I was so sad after my pel meni hajj when I finished savoring my final dumpling that I went ahead and bought a bonus frozen order to eat for breakfast the next day.\n\nHalf and half.  The works.  If you don't get em spicy you're doin it wrong.\n\nI've had pelmeni in NYC at Russian restaurants and bought them frozen from Russian groceries now here in my fair home of Boston, but they're always a disappointment by comparison.  Listen up Paul - if you ever open up shop/a food truck in Boston, I will dedicate my existence to ensuring your success.\n\nBest meal of 2013, hands down.  Nothing tastes better than nostalgia - especially when the product is even better than you remembered.\n\nI will be back - please please stay in business forever.  I cannot face a world without Paul's pel meni again.
4 ||| I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish.
0 ||| The \"new\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.
3 ||| Stopped in with a group of 5 guys who love this place.  We basically told the sushi chefs to have at it and make whatever...everything that came was very good.  Sashimi was very fresh, rolls were excellent with some interesting flavors and the sushi chefs were very fun.  If I could find this place again, I'd certainly come back for the creations.
4 ||| I love Kasbah and often go there for takeaway (I wouldn't recommend going to dine in as there is only one table that sits 6 people).\n\nThe vegetable bhuna pizza is one of the best takeaway fusions foods you will ever had. I didn't like the sound of it when a friend took me there for the first time and ordered it, but after having it once I keep going back for this and often add in the mixed started combo which has a great variety of chicken/pork/veggie delights.\n\nIt's cheap, the food is great and the staff are all very nice, perfect for what it is, no frills, just super tasty food.
1 ||| Edit:  I don't like this place anymore!  Last experience- the shrimp pad thai was really blah, had no shrimp in it so I had to ask for some, and came with fried rice which I didn't even want (and so less pad thai).  Also service was really slow for lunch.  It's such a huge room too, you just don't get the kind of personal service that you can get somewhere else, like Prommares.
0 ||| I e-mailed them my review to give them a chance to reprive themselves, annnnnndddd nothing.
4 ||| This is the best Mexican food I have ever tasted. I know that's not saying much at all since I hail from NYC, but bear with me.\n\nThe tacos run you 2 dollars and are stuffed with meat, guacamole, salsas, onions, cilantro, and so much ugh. I ate about 6 - tongue, beef head, spicy pork, tripe (THE BEST!), carne asada, beef shoulder. They were all good, except maybe the beef shoulder because it reminded me too much of my homestyle Russian food. The tripe was the star though, with the intestines fried to a crunchy yet still a bit chewy perfection. In addition to the tacos, I also tried a carne asada quesadilla. My only knowledge of quesadillas being those flattened, depressing (yet still delicious) things in Taco Bell, I was mindblown. Everything had such a great flavor and texture.\n\nThey serve grilled peppers and scallions on the side for free, which have a great flavor. Also on the side for you to grab at your leisure are radishes and lime pieces. Mexican fountain sodas are also available but I didn't like any of the flavors, and was upset that they didn't have Jarritos.\n\nNext time I come back to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here again, and saying hi to my Mexican bro with whom I conversed in my rudimentary Spanish.
1 ||| We went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a \"shrunken\" happy hour menu. We ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders. They had no taste and were overlooked. It seems to us the quality of this place is going down!! Sad for that given the fact we are regulars!!!
4 ||| This place gets brownie points in my book for being open during the wee hours of the night. This place would normally be an average 3-4 star rating but it gets 5 stars due to the fact that its open 24 hours, it's located off Spring Mountain and Valley View (relatively close to the strip, making it convenient for late night eats for locals getting off work or after a night of clubbing or gambling). \n\nWhat I also like about this place is that no matter how busy it is, service here is FAST! After sitting down and ordering, I'm pretty sure we almost always get our orders (even with parties of 4+) within 15-20min or less!\n\nI always start off with ordering their calamari which I find very tasty. Then I enjoy ordering the Mongolian beef or the Bun bo hue; a vermicelli noodle soupy have good pho according to my Vietnamese friends who always order that but I usually don't get it because I'm not in the mood for soup and the bun is basically the same ingredients without the broth.
1 ||| Thankfully, we had a discounted \"friends and family\" rate for this hotel because it is not worth the full rate.  This review may be long, but it is worth your while to read if you are considering this hotel...\n\nThe hotel is very clean and very nice.  The complimentary hotel shuttle is an excellent bonus, and the location in downtown Tempe is great.  Now, read on for the negative comments.\n\nWe checked in on a Saturday night after 9:00pm.  After traveling all day, we were exhausted.  However, we soon realized that the entire hotel was filled with LOUD, DRUNK, FRAT BOYS.  Our room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard ended up being next to and across from 2 rooms filled with FRAT BOYS.  We immediately had our room changed to a room overlooking the parking lot.  Of course, we were awoken by the frat boys around 2:00am that morning.  HOW COULD THIS HOTEL ALLOW FRAT BOYS TO RUN IT FOR A WEEKEND?  It is the hotel's responsibility to enforce a quite and safe environment and they failed to do that.  Thankfully the frat boy idiots left the next day (there were several busloads of them).  \n\nNext, the hotel is located next to TRAIN TRACKS.  So, we were awoken EVERY NIGHT and early morning by the horn of a FREIGHT TRAIN.  I had read about this from other reviews, but I thought they were exaggerating.  I was very wrong.  How can this hotel be right next to a train track and not mention it on their web site?  They should give out free earplugs.  I was ready to overlook the idiot frat boys, but the loud train rumbling by every night totally ruined this stay for my wife and I.  \n\nLastly, the breakfast is over-priced.  They messed up our orders and the \"buffet\" includes  belgian waffles (which you have to make yourself).  The \"continental\" breakfast costs almost $10 an includes juice, yogurt, pastries, bagels...basically the same stuff you can get for free at other hotels!  \n\nThe staff was all excellent, the hotel is actually very nice, but being awoken by a freight train every night is unacceptable.  Also, the walls are very thin so you can hear everything outside of your room.  We would never stay in this hotel again, not even with the wonderful \"friends and family\" rate.  We would rather spend full price and stay in a hotel that is not next to train tracks.
0 ||| Would give it 0 stars if I could and total waste of some money. Went for a Vegas painting party event and it  sucks! Party started at 6 so we arrived around 5 so we could eat before and get some drinks. First thing we noticed was that their was \"NO AIR CONDITIONING\"!!!! C'mon this is Vegas people! You know it's bad when outside is cooler than inside! Sat down and no service, finally went up there to ask for help. Was told we have to sit at bar if we wanted to eat and drink. So fine we did & waited forever and had to get up again for help. Anyway, since it was happy hour ordered buffalo chicken bites and macaroni bites. My mom ordered a lettuce wedge and cheese sticks. Omg, the lettuce wedge was laughable! They cut a head of lettuce in half and drowned it with dressing. As for the other items they were alright but I could get the same food and quality in a drive thru. By the time we got our food it was already 6:15 and the party started. Had to down our food because they wouldn't let us take our food upstairs and if it's not enough. They said we couldn't get happy hour when we're upstairs. If we wanted that price we have to come down and get the drinks ourselves. Even though theirs a waitress that will be serving us for the party. Huh? The upstairs is attached to the damn building! Never heard that before and I wasn't even as upset as the other patrons. They really let the owner/manager have it. They only had 1 bartender, waitress, and the manager/owner working there. NEVER will I ever come back to this rathole again! Instead of it being called Republic Kitchen..it should be called Republic Sewage! I can't believe their still in business....hmmm, maybe that's why theirs no air condition!
3 ||| Great menu and good food!
3 ||| I like it. I can't speak to authenticity, since I've never been to thailand, but I can say the food is delicious, and will hit the spot with the usual suspects of things you can expect from an American Thai restaurant. And they have a few things on the menu you don't see everywhere else, and its all delicious. I dream about their pumpkin curry!
3 ||| About as large as a small Wal-Mart, this is truly a warehouse of shoes. And surprisingly, not all women's shoes. There is a large section of shoes for men too!\n\nI stuck to my side of the shop and saw that the shoes were organized by style - boots, laceups, slip-ons and such were all neatly put together with one on display and a stack of others underneath with a variety of sizes. I have average size feet, so it's rare that there is any problem finding shoes in my size that fit.\n\nAfter I had narrowed down my selection to just two and was walking around to test comfort, I spotted their \"clearance\" racks in the back had a pair of the style I wanted in my size! So instead of buying a full-price (marked down?) pair at $62, I got a \"last pair in store\" with a 20% discount that was a name brand (Timberlake!) for $52. Boom!\n\nWhen you shop at Off Broadway, you also get an encore rewards coupon for 10% of your spending that you can use on your next visit. I can't imagine that I'll be back for shoes again and remember this coupon, but hey, you never know!
2 ||| Not too shabby, however, the service was quite slow, for such a busy area. The food was also just average, and the lobster, well, for the price the portion was tiny. While there are a few good items on the menu, it certainly is more of a tourist trap. Just an average place with average food and service, overpriced.
3 ||| If you're a carnivore, come hungry. \n\nFirst time for lunch, before it has always been for dinner! \nHad  the lobster bisque, tasty, but I have had better, one that has lobster meat and  that didn't taste so salty. \nThat seems to be the theme here, especially on the meat. \n\nThe salad bar is outstanding, all the great things you love in salads but don't always splurge on them. Roasted peppers, caper berries, blanched asparagus, a variety of mixed salads & Imported cheeses and meats. All delicious!\n\nNow onto the meat, the great thing, is you can experience all the flavors of tender juiciness with just small bites. You can tell the gauchos to cut a thin piece for you and they will... \n\nMy favorite is the top sirloin, this is what they are known for, followed by the flank steak. Yes, they make it tender. Lamb chop - cooked perfectly, BBQ pork rib great... \nThe parmesan chicken looked good, but I did not want to fill out on chicken or sausage. \nSides of garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed bananas are included... \n\nFor dessert we ordered Key Lime pie and Chocolate Mousse cake, unfortunately these are not made daily, and you can tell it had been frozen. \n\nService is great, atmosphere is nice and food is good! You don't leave hungry, and trust me after eating there for lunch... no dinner tonight...
4 ||| I really feel the poor reviews are unwarranted at Chayo. My guess is that they were because it is a new restaurant and they had some kinks to work out. I was there this weekend and had a fabulous time. Our hostesses greeted us warmly, our server was friendly, and the food was fantastic! The Yucca fries are a must get! I had the chicken enchiladas and was pleasantly surprised at the kick they had as I can't find spicy Mexican food anywhere in Vegas. My husband had the pork torta and loved it. And don't deprive yourself of the guacamole! Get a seat on the patio or the bar for some great people watching. We loved it and will be back (and it takes a lot to get this local to go to the Strip!)
3 ||| Been using their services since they opened and never had a complaint.  They have affordable packages for those that don't like to tan too often. I always get the sampler which lasts me about 6-8 weeks for $100 which has 3 spray tans & like 5 or 6 tanning bed sessions from level 3 to 5. \nYou must MUST shower and scrub without using any lotion,  oils,  moisturizer to get the best results for the spray tanning booth. Otherwise u will be wasting your money.  Spray tan looks great for about a week\nAlso buy your tanning lotion online or at sallys,  they are all the same. I dislike the fact that all these places have super expensive tanning lotions with fancy names. Other than this which is optional \nI like this place but have one suggestion: SMILE more often guys... :) your customers will appreciate it
4 ||| Wow just Wow! We stayed on the 33rd floor in tower 1 ( which is closer to the strip about 5 min walk ) \n\nEveryone here is so professional and upscale. Every time we asked for tea, towels, coffee, toothbrushes, etc... they brought up plenty.\n\nThe Suite came with full kitchenette - oven- stove- microwave - toaster- blender- sink - even soap and kitchen supplies.\n\nJetted hot tub for 2 people very roomy and spotless.\nthe King size bed was superb with soft pillows but not too soft.\nSheets were changed daily and always clean.\n\nLoved the fact that we had a huge balcony! The Hotel is non- smoking so this was perfect for us. We took our Hookah! \n\nThe bathroom had the toilet in separate room and twin sinks for his and hers. A stone tiled shower w great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Full sized mirrors everywhere - Makes perfect selfie pics! \nLighting was excellent and lots of counter space.\nCloset had two comfy robes, safe ( fits laptop) iron with iron board, and plenty of hangers.\n\nRoom also had a couch with coffee table, desk with notepads and lamp. There is a separate cabinet for ice and plenty of cabinet space all around. \nI could not be any happier with this Hotel. \nHotel also has a gift shop, gym and plenty of swimming pools and jacuzzis around... beautiful grounds super clean.\n\nOnly cons were: TV had only one HBO station ( they are updating this soon )\nFood service was excellent but food is pricey and bland.\nThere is a $25 resort fee per night but totally worth it.\nEveryone was super nice and walking distance front the strip. The night was peaceful and we didn't run into one problem. I will def be staying here when in Vegas! LOVED IT
4 ||| Never had a bad drink from this store. The drive thru can get a little long, but it's worth the wait.
3 ||| Being originally from Arizona, I know a good taco.  The taco stand outside of Reyna's is GOOD.   The carne asada meat was tender, though I usually prefer a little more char. A friend i was with got the beef tongue, a little too eccentric for my taste, but he loved it.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the tortilla.  I am usually tuned off by corn tortillas, but theirs are soft, not dry, and don't fall apart as the taco juices seep in. In other words exactly what you need for a good street taco.  The best part is the taco barrista squeezes fresh lime juice on top of the taco as a finishing touch. It really puts it over the top.
3 ||| Let's make this fleeting moment last forever\nSo, tell me what you're waiting for?\nI'm gonna keep it frozen here forever,\nThere's no regretting anymore at...The Henry! - Krewella (alive)\n\nI was intrigued by this place because it's one of those 24 hour cafe's at every hotel except this one doesn't have the the looks and feels of one. Already late for lunch, there was no question that the French dip was the way to go, as it came with tater tots with a slight hint of truffle oil! With so many restaurants in Vegas that make you order fries separately with their sandwiches or burgers, this is a huge plus! How many places come with sides with their steaks in Vegas? Exactly my point. Especially since it isn't built into the price, it felt like a great deal here. The french dip tasted great, and we finished all the tater tots. The only thing I wished was that I could choose how the prime rib was cooked, but they said it's already pre-prepared..oh well. \n\nAgain, it's open 24 hours so a great place to come after clubbing/late night fun at the Cosmo. I will be willing to come back anytime next time I'm staying here again as an afternoon/late night option (which will be in the very near future..comped rooms ftw! -although the terrace's aren't fun in the cold winter nights!!)
0 ||| The only reason I will be going here is that it's the closest gym to my house.  After my free 1 hour personal training session that came with joining, it will take all my energy to walk back into that place.\n\nI've never seen such high pressure sales tactics.  The dude trying to sell me their outrageously expensive personal training packages just wouldn't take no for an anwer.  When I said I needed to ask my husband about the extra money, he said \"I'm disappointed that your husband doesn't support you and you have to ask him about that kind of thing.\"  What an a-hole.  I walked out at that point (before I ripped his face off).
0 ||| Sorry, folks...this is another Peoria/Surprise/Glendale pizza place I can take off my list.  Went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza.  I should have been concerned when it arrived and the pieces wouldn't break apart - with a kitchen knife and fork we were just barely able to cut them apart.  First bite...the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour.\nLong story short, the girl asked how things were, as she saw us eating the toppings and leaving the crust.  We told her of the crust and her response was \"Sorry.\"  I can't explain the 5 stars vs my one star, all I know is what the pizza was tonight.  Never, ever, again.
2 ||| I walk by here on the way to work, and spied some amazing looking humus, waffle fries, and burgers sitting on tables on the patio more than once, so I decided to take my mom and sister when they visited.  Stupidly, I ordered a salad, which was only \"fine.\"  So think of this review as actually more like ***?, with extra stars potentially reserved for when I go back and order the dishes that looked good enough to lure me in there to begin with.
1 ||| +.+.+.+.+.+Two Things Have Changed in the Past 30 Days +.+.+.+.+.+.+\n\nPRICES have been  increasing quite frequently ...... and they just did it again.\nEnough is enough ...... They now have become very expensive.\nWe'll still continue going here ........ reducing our visits by 50%.\nThere's a wonderful Chinese restaurant at Shea and 92nd Street that gives much  larger portions ..... at about the same price as Flo's.\n\nSecondly the remodel is Beautiful ..... However, why wasn't the Rock Concert noise level remedied ?????
4 ||| Best eyecare office in Arizona! Customer Service is best in breed and products are A rated. Highly recommended
4 ||| I needed a 5x8 trailer for an event I was hosting and this Uhaul location was the only one in the area that had one left.  I didn't expect my car to give me the issues connecting the trailer that it did, and I certainly didn't expect the incredibly helpful service this place gave me in solving those problems.  Despite being overwhelmed with customers they were able to help me fix everything and get going, and didn't for a moment let me think I was being too much of a pain or taking up their time.\nThanks guys for making what could have been a disaster into a great success!
1 ||| YUCK!  The Baka burrito was COLD!  It had mole sauce instead of ranchero sauce and they just can't seem to find RIPE TOMATOES!  Even though the meat was cold the bite or two I had the meat was pretty decent. Maybe Baja Fresh will get their act together. If you can do that I will be back. I won't patronize this establishment again until probably July.  To be fair, they did refund my money for a second time in as many attempts.
2 ||| I've been to the Bank twice and I'm not sure if I'd go back. I think my first trip was an anamoly. The club was poppin with amazaaaaaazing music. I wish I could have got that mix! The club was packed and since the Bank is kinda tiny, it felt like a house party. Everyone was dancing and having a great time, you could really feel the positive energy. We met some cool people and hung at their table majority of the night so it made the night more enjoyable. You never realize how much you value being able to sit down when you want to LOL! I didn't want to leave the club because I was having so much fun, but I had an early flight so I had too :(\n\nThe 2nd trip, 6 months later on Christmas Day was less thrilling. I was on the guestlist so we walked right in at like 11. It was DOA and as time went by the club filled up the crowd looked very unattractive. I can't even blame the lameness on the fact that it was a holiday so it may have been so an off night because we left and went to XS and it was packed with better looking people *shrug*. \n\nOverall I'm thinking that on my first trip to the Bank either I got really lucky or maybe Christmas night  just so happend to be a wrong place/wrong time bust? Maybe the third time will be the charm??
2 ||| It is a clean place and they have good service. The Koi pond is pretty cool. The sandwich I ordered was pretty awful, don't get the turkey because it is like packaged meat you can buy at a supermarket. The prices were on par with other delis, but you can get a much better sandwich for the same price elsewhere.
2 ||| Friendly staff\nCrunchy munchy wrap was yummy\nSweet potato wedges with sriracha mayo was pretty good.\n\nWill be back.
1 ||| The room is expensive, and the service is so-so.\n\nThe room service didn't make the room, and the room service soup was overly salty.\n\nBeen to Vegas MANY times, and have stayed here a couple of times.  The casino itself is nice, but they could definitely improve their room service.
3 ||| Im going to be honest, i had NO FLIPPING idea what was going on!\n\nbut it looked cool as hell, i say its an assault on your senses. prob wouldn't pay to watch it again though.
2 ||| Decent pizza, pretty close in quality to Setabello. Menu has gotten a lot smaller and the price is a little on the high side for pizza. Good service and cozy environment.
4 ||| I really enjoyed going to this place. The place was clean when we got there, and I watched the staff clean various times over the hours that we were there. My daughter loved the various play areas, and spent time in all of them. I really liked how thought out and well designed the play areas were.There were areas for crawling babies all the way up to older children. We will definitely come back.
2 ||| Hostess' are lame when it comes to seating, so just tell them were you would like to sit before you get moving to your table. Every server I have had here has been awesome, and they don't card you if you come with a middle aged man with a black AmEx :D
1 ||| Stayed at this hotel for work. Let me start off by saying there is nothing else in close proximity to this hotel or this cafe so I think they have relied on this advantage otherwise there would not stay in business. The food is ALRIGHT but the customer service is terrible. The prices are also a little high... $13 breakfast buffet that consists of\"  dried up eggs, bacon/sausage, and some fruit. I ended up skipping breakfast the last couple of days and just having a starbucks drink from the lobby of the hotel.
4 ||| So far so good! I'll have to update this after the actual wedding, but so far the planning with Mandalay Bay has been pleasant. Our coordinator is Aleena and she always emails or calls me back in a timely manner and is helpful. We visited the chapel in person and agreed it's much prettier than it looks online. We're excited hopeful it all goes smoothly!
0 ||| Last Friday night my husband and I were able to try this place.  We say we want to eat there every time we go to the movies.  Well unfortunately,  IT WAS AWFUL...The counter where you make your meal was disgustingly dirty, my rice was watery and when I got my meal it looked like a bowl of mush....something you would feed a bunch of chickens. I had chosen a ton of veggies and fish,  well they destroyed it during the cooking process.  It looked awful and it tasted worse. I also spent the later part of my evening in the bathroom!  (not just me, hubby too) Never again will I eat at Genghis Grill...I actually thought about calling my bank and disputing the charge. This place is nothing short a high end really bad Chinese food restaurant, you know the  ind where you are eating and you know you will regret it later!!!!    YUCK YUCK YUCK...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
4 ||| Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
0 ||| sometimes, childhood memories are best left behind and not revisited!\n\ni don't know what happened to this place. they used to be awesome. a place you were excited to go as a kid and you'd bug your parents or whoever is taking you to old montreal to get you some tail. and those donut holes, heaven! i fondly remember multiple school field trips to old montreal and munching on some beavers with my classmates.\n\nbut alas, those memories are long gone. what used to be fluffy and generous and tasty is now a sad state of affair. not only are they thinner, it shrunk in size, taste like cardboard and most of all, isn't made with fairy dust and love anymore.\n\nprice went up but you know, inflation and crap..\n\nshould you go just for nostalgia? me thinks not! bring the kids? maybe but you're better off making them yourself
2 ||| This is just for the childrens play area.\n\nTivoli Village is very elegant, but its def a ghost town. My son and I frequent the childrens area during the late evening because its a free and pretty safe place to play. \n\nBack when it first opened I was kinda disappointed because they hadnt had the shade things yet, we went a few nights ago and they did install them which was nice. The major downfall is there is hardly any light in the play area at night. We like to go later because its cooler, but no lights are no bueno!\n\nOverall this is a pretty blah play area, especially compared to town centers... or even a parks. The sway chair thing is pretty neat as is the jungle gym... but other than that its pretty boring. Luckily my son is pretty adventurous and makes up his rides. \n\nAnother downfall is the lack of security, I know its a fairly small outdoor mall but I only seen 1 bike officer and he was only around there for a few minutes. Tivoli Village itself is totally fab, but they seriously need to add more stores so it doesnt look soo sparse. \n\nNext ion our list is to try Brio then the other places : )
2 ||| Tried a gyro with a pickle in it for the first time. Dislike. \nI usually like a variety of flavor in my gyros but with the pickle in it, a big one at that, it really dominated the taste. That's honestly mainly all i tasted was the pickle and some sour cream. \nMy server recommended the garlic potatoes. They weren't really garlicky at all. It was just really oily and bland, something I wasn't expecting. Honestly I feel like this restaurant is a product of it being over hyped by the masses. Kind of like how everything is apparently amazing in California.. but in reality its not. I'm glad i tried this place but if I was really craving Mediterranean I'll probably take my taste buds elsewhere.
0 ||| The service is ok but the food is not worth it.  Found a 10 inch strand of hair in my food!! Gross
0 ||| Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.
3 ||| Overall, a great deal! It is a small buffet, and obviously some things are better than others. But there is a good selection, and the Philly cheesesteak station was awesome! Great variety on the salad bar. You can make your own sandwich. Plenty of hot dish options, with a lot of variety. Quite a few dessert selections to choose from as well, including sugar-free options. Sunday evening dinner was only $9.18, you can't beat that!
2 ||| Good neighborhood sports bar. Friendly staff and good management. Enjoy the pingpong n bags games for outside patio
2 ||| Ok I have been here before and food was great, my review is based on today's visit! I honestly dont know where they went wrong, prime rib and all the accompaniments were only mediocre at best! And for the price 39$ for 10oz I felt ripped off! I wanted to steal the salt and pepper blends to at least make up for a rather lackluster meal, I really was looking forward to my trip there and was very disappointed, prime rib was tough and no flavor, creamed spinach was flavorless, and mashed potato was almost soup consistency ! For a place that specializes in spices everything left a lot to be desired! Service was prompt and friendly, but waitress got bogged down with a big party and left us wanting refills on drinks. I heard her ask for help , but her co-workers were too \"busy\" to provide any ( they actually were on the other side talking, c'mon teamwork people!!) we would have gotten at least another glass of wine, but dinner was almost done and at that point it wasn't really worth the effort, of tracking the server down, ( she was busy making salads for her party) she was very apologetic on her absence , but it made us feel bad for her, not really the atmosphere you want to have when dining out! Only good thing was salad and bread, 5 stars for those and about 2 1/2 for everything else!!
2 ||| We were staying at the Royal Palms for a couple of days and everyday we would have breakfast at T Cooks. It was delicious. \n\nMost memorable the frittata with artichokes and sundried tomates. \n\nDinner wasn't so great - I wouldn't recommend. The dishes were too strongly flavored for the ingredients. I had a mushroom soup that I couldn't finish - it was way to intense.  Also had a monkfish wrapped with bacon which is normally a great combo but I'm not sure what oil they fry with or what amount they used, the dish was over powered and the freshness of the ingredients were lost.
0 ||| In receipt of some coupons, I ordered Geno's for delivery and should have read the reviews first.  I'm a fair reviewer and will sit in the same corner with the others.  Not the best pizza, not very good at all, yet not the worst pizza I've ever had.  The price-line is great and if they can pick up the flavor, PLUS improved product temperature upon delivery, they'd get another shot.\n\nIf you're looking for good pizza in Gilbert, there are options and seek them out people.
1 ||| I heard so many wonderful things about the Wicked Spoon, so when I finally tried it, I was incredibly disappointed.\n\nWe went at 10:30 on a weekday. No line whatsoever. Was it our timing? I don't know. All I know is that the hot food I put on my plate was already cold when I sat down. I should've done what the husband did: get a made-to-order omelette. By that time, though, I was no longer interested in any more savory food. Cold, tough potatoes and a cold, flavorless eggs benedict will do that to you.\n\nAt least the desserts were good. The chocolate covered strawberries were excellent.\n\nThe hype, and the $26 price tag for brunch, set my expectations pretty high. I was pretty cranky- and not close to full- when I walked out of there. Unless someone else is buying, I won't be back.
1 ||| Let me start by saying I am not a very picky eater and I have never not finished a meal no matter how bad it was.  That has changed.  My entree was the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  I ordered it medium plus like I do at all steak houses(I know, this is not a steak house).  It came out charred in some parts of the top but yet still pink on the inside.  It was the most dry and chewy steak I ever ate.  I actually had to spit out my fifth bite because it was so bad.  I didn't touch the rest of it.  I then tried some of my wife's chef special(chicken parmesan).  She had stopped eating because she said it tasted like a Marie Callendar's tv dinner.  I had to concur.  The only reason I did not give 1 star is because the appetizers were good(spicy ahi tuna chips, and artichoke dip), as well as the desserts(crem brule, and tiramisu).  Needless to say, we will never be back here again.  I don't think it will be open much longer, we went on a saturday night and there were only two other couples there when we got there and only another table when we left.  Pretty sad and disappointing.
1 ||| Atmosphere was meh..\nFood was meh..\nService was meh..\nPrices were meh..\n\nNothing about Zupas made me happy.. and i get excited easily. I wanted to kill all the Biltmore Business people in there too. With a sword.
4 ||| This place rocks!  The carne asada burrito with a side of guacamole and the other homemade salsas is sheer perfection.  Super friendly service as well.
3 ||| Plenty of good time here\n\nMiller Ale House is situated in the Town Centre shopping and entertainment complex.\n\nThis place is a tight sports bar that has great food for lunch and dinner to boot. The Ale house has all your draft and bottle needs with a decent range of 50 to 90 beers at one time.\n\nI recommend the wings while watching some hockey or basketball. They use to have moose drool beer which is my jam but they unfortunately took it off the menu.\n\nThe service here is always decent and beer is cold. I don't have any real complaints other than the location kinda of caters to tourist market, if they opened in Summerlin somewhere it would an awesome local hang out spot for sure
0 ||| Overall: \nThis place is really really nice (the decor, ambiance and outdoor scenery), but I was not happy with the crowd here. I don't know if it's always like that or if we just went on an off night, but how horrible... My friends (in our early & late twenties) went to this club on a Saturday night hoping to try their dry ice fish bowl called the witch doctor. That was the original reason why I picked this place because it looked so cool especially with the nice rooftop view, but when we got inside... the crowd were in their late 40s or 50s.... which was such a turn off. We couldn't find anyone to dance with  and I felt as I walked further into the club, everyone was getting older. I felt bad because I had picked such a horrible place when we could have gone to a newer & cooler club like Marquee :( One of my friend even left the club...\n\nOutdoor was AMAZING, there was a beautiful view of Vegas, and there's also an OUTSIDE downstairs dance floor with a pole, which we almost missed out on because you cannot tell that there was a downstairs. Indoor, there are stairs leading downstairs, but I'm not sure if that leads outdoors. I think the indoor downstairs might have been the restaurant. Don't let the pictures fool you...it fooled me. I will not be returning.
2 ||| There were tons of hype from Hakkasan when they were about to open but my overall feel is that it was just okay. One thing Hakkasan successfully did was revive the south end of the strip in bringing more nightlife.\n\nPros:\n- The top resident DJ's Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Bingo Players, Deadma5, etc. No Need for explanation.\n- If you're living on south end, no need to taxi to Wynn/Encore\n\n\nCons:\n- Competition with Light Nightclub which I feel is a better club\n- Crowded and isn't really fun unless you get bottle service and even then you might not get a direct view of the stage\n- Feels like a maze, upstairs, downstairs, hallway here, overpass here, etc.\n- Light setup leaves much to the imagination after being to Exchange LA in Southern California\n\nI had an okay experience with the venue, it was very blah. I only enjoyed it because Dada Life killed it.
1 ||| I was taken here once by a group of my ex-boyfriend friends, who all go to Napier. As it is just a 5 minute walk from the Napier Halls, it's their local. As a result it was full of shouting students and roudy drunks. Not really my scene.\n\nThe bar itself is reasonably nice, it's a nice dark brown and cream theme. But the seats are grotty and tables are sticky. We went to play pool and only one pool queue was in operation, it made the whole thing quite difficult. When I was there they were showing the Superbowl so every other minute people would be screaming in my ear or swearing at a bad call.  \nThe staff were quite snippy too, I didn't feel very welcomed, and they made no effort to clear up all the empties we were beside.
3 ||| I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it.
0 ||| I am only reviewing the TEPPAN TABLE SIDE: Japanese Teppanyaki steakhouses are my favorite type of restaurant.  I was excited when Hayashi opened in Surprise.  Unfortunately the excitement quickly wore off when I ate there.\n\n**THIS IS NOT A HIBACHI PLACE** Hibachi is with an OPEN GRATE GRILL - you can tell who the N00b reviewers are here to this style of cuisine-They dont know what they are talking about.\n\nI have ate at various Teppan steakhouses in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Hawaii, and Las Vegas so I have extensive experience in knowing what is good and bad teppan style dining.   \n\nIf you have never ate at a teppan steakhouse than I am sure you will find this review useless and your experience there great because its your first time.  Teppan steakhouses is the style of Japanese dining where they cook right in front of you. Benihana is one of the more popular chain restaurants that has this style of cooking.  \n\nThe chefs are all under experienced (except the master chef who i have yet to see at a cooking table) and the rice, vegetables steak and chicken are all under par in comparison to other restaurants I have been too.  Also, hayashi doesnt have a lunch menu on the weekends, they charge FULL DINNER PRICE. ... Ah-So doesnt do that, you can get the same dinner meal at lunch on the weekend at Ah So for less.\n\nAlso, I have a Japanese friend that ate at the non-teppan side and the waitress was Japanese and she found it difficult to recommend a good authentic Japanese dish.  \n\nTake a look at all the good reviews here... not a single Japanese person will recommend this place.  Its GRINGO Japanese,... like Taco Bell is Mexican to people. \n\nIf you are looking for good caliber teppan style cooking this isnt the place... I am sure others will disagree but I also here people recommending great mexican food and when I check it out its totally horrible food... i guess taco bell and del taco are too much of an influence on people in regards to what is real mexican cuisine, but that is another review.\n\nUPDATE: Went there to lunch for just SUSHI and waited and waited and waited... we bailed on them.  Horrible place to eat ... I hope they close and another better Japanese restaurant opens in its place.
0 ||| I had shopped around for a boarding facility for my dog. Found this place, went in for a tour loved it, it was clean and people very nice! I made the appointment for drop off signed all papers needed-- VERIFIED my drop off date 3 times because it was Memorial Day. The morning of the drop off I called numerous times with no answer, went over there sign said CLOSED!! We had a trip plan to leave in 3 hrs an in a last moment I had to find care for my dog THANK GOODNESS for Petsmart doggie hotel!! I left messages with each phone call an never got a response?! So seriously is there people there with the pets?! Petsmart was AHHHMAZING an guess what EVERYTIME I called someone answered an they didn't leave me hanging!!
2 ||| The first time I went to Pho 8 I was just getting over a cold (no, I wasn't contagious) and felt the need for a soup. After sampling the wonton bowl, I thought it was the best place on the planet. It was so good that I ended up back a week later, only to discover that while it was still pretty good, their plastic drinking glasses and plastic soup spoons reek of bleach or some other cleansing agent. Nice to know they are sanitized, but I could live without the chemical infusion with my lunch. \n\nGood soup, clean place, but a little too heavy on the cleansers. I'd still go back, but I think I'll bring my own spoon next time.
4 ||| Clean, friendly, and professional; \nEvery time I come to Elaine's I know I'm receiving great customer service from my favorite Grace and the rest of the team.  The whole shop always seems to be having fun and the customers almost always seem to be having a great time.\n\nI always come in for a manicure with a clear coat and occasionally treat myself to one of their fantastic pedis as well.  The price is great too, and I've never had a bad session!\n\nImportant:  tons of people know about Elaine's so they are always very busy.  DON'T FORGET TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.  They are more often than not booked solid so if you can't be seen it's because you didn't call ahead.  Trust me, they're worth the extra effort!
2 ||| We decided to give Blu Basil a try Saturday night for something different.  We entered and weren't quite sure what to do.  Do we wait to be seated?  Do we order at that counter way in the back of the restaurant?  We stood at the front pretending to read the menus, watching what other people were doing.  We discovered that, yes, indeed, you order at the back and then take a seat, any seat.  Kinda like one of the noodle places here in town.  Now that we had the basics down, we could walk past everyone sitting, order at the counter, get our number, and go grab a table.  \n\nI ordered the grilled chicken and prosciutto panini, which was actually very good.  It was toasted just right and the ingredients were very flavorful.  The pesto pasta salad I ordered with it was tasty, too.  \n\nUnfortunately, we decided that Blu Basil isn't quite sure what it wants to be.  Is it breakfast, lunch or dinner?  Is it a fast food or sit-down restaurant?  Is it a restaurant or a coffee bar?  Is it a nice place to relax?  Is it a sports bar?  Is it a place to bring the kids and watch TV?  Yes, there were four unstrategically placed TVs along one wall of the restaurant, which clashed with the modern Cheesecake Factory-style lighting fixtures.  \n\nI think Blu Basil has potential, but it just needs to work out the details.  I think they'd do well by taking out the TVs, making it into a service restaurant (no ordering at the counter) and converting the back area into a real coffee bar with atmosphere.  OR there needs to be more signage so first-timers know what to do when they walk in.
0 ||| Ate here before seeing Terry Fator. This is my first time eating at this chain. I was NOT impressed. Freschetta FROZEN pizza tasted better than this place. The prices were ridiculous. For the same price I would rather go to Settebello's. They are the BEST pizza in town! Save your money and forgo California Pizza Kitchen.
2 ||| I've been here on 2 occasions. The first time I got the fried chicken benedict and it was not that great to me. I thought the smothering of the whole plate with the chipotle cream sauce ruined it for me. My second trip yielded much better results. I had the salmon scramble with brie cheese. It was delicious! Of course the portions are outrageous, but not a bad meal. Three people for breakfast was $76 with Mimosas of course.
1 ||| Not a fan. Heard so much about Barrio Cafe and finally tried it for my birthday. I did enjoy the guacamole. The margarita was also very good until the bill came- I never would have gotten a second drink at nearly $14 each! The waitor said it was their \"special\" today.  Although tasty, the drink was small and did not have much tequila. We both ordered from the Tortas menu and neither of us were happy with our choice-very bland. I know that  they advertise that they don't do hot and spicy food, but we did expect flavor. Over priced and over rated. We won't return.
0 ||| LAST UPDATE!!!  I got an email from restaurant.com this morning, it's official! Since ATL Wings doesn't know how to respect  their customers and they ignored their contract and policies with restaurant.com, they have been removed from the discount program. I was allowed to get another certificate to a different restaurant in exchange for the hassle we went through. \n\nATL Wings, my employer gave you the opportunity to fix this but you decided that it's more important to overcharge your customers with invalid fees just so you can keep the extra cash. You took the gamble and you lost on this one.
1 ||| Just got back from a stay at the Phoenician.   Although the resort was beautiful, I was thoroughly disappointed in their service and won't return. I don't take a lot of vacations but do like to stay at a top notch place when I do go. For me, the service is by far the most important aspect on my trips and I found the staff at the Phoenician lacking in that respect. We were given a mountain view room. Typically, when I hear a hotel advertise mountain versus pool view rooms, it's not a big deal to me (in fact, I'd prefer the mountain except if I'm in a coastal hotel with a view of the ocean). In this case though, what they mean by mountain is opening your shade and being right next to a mountain (so close you can tell the bugs on the bushes). So essentially, you don't really have a view. That wasn't the greatest, but the bigger problem was I had no phone reception on half of the room and the other half I was only able to get one bar (clearly a result of being right next to a mountain). We went to the NCAA basketball game on our first day in town so we weren't in the room much. The next morning, I went down to use the fitness facility and found it to be sub-par for a hotel of the level of the Phoenician (needed a serious refresh...they have a bunch of antiquated machines and spin bikes). I asked the concierge if she knew of a track nearby (figured I'd just go for a jog instead since I didn't like the fitness center). She had some maps laid out for jogs on the complex but I informed her that running on asphalt takes its toll on my knees and that I really needed a track. I asked if there was a college nearby and she directed me to ASU, but gave me bad directions (had me turn right on Camelback and it should have been left). I drove for about 35 minutes and never came across the first street that I was supposed to turn on (Scottsdale Blvd). So that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing. As I kept having calls drop off on my phone, I became more annoyed with the situation and by Saturday morning complained to the front desk. The snooty clerk replied..\"well sir, we can't do anything about the way the hotel is constructed\". I thought to myself, so what are you saying?...your customers have to suck it up and deal with it? I would think a more professional clerk would have apologized for the inconvenience and immediately look to switch my room (instead of me telling the clerk that this wouldn't do). So I had the room switched but it wasn't available yet (it was 7am). He said I would receive a call informing me when the room was ready. By 12:30, we hadn't received a call and had to leave for the game so I called the front desk. The clerk said to leave our packed luggage on the bed and it would be moved for us to the new room by the time we got back. We arrived back at the hotel at 5. The new room was ready but the luggage hadn't been moved (they said they would take care of it right away). So we went to the bar for a little over an hour. We got back to the room...still no luggage. I called back to the desk and the clerk apologized and said it would be done right way). After another hour and still no luggage, I went to the desk and complained (we had 8 o'clock dinner reservations at a restaurant away from the hotel and needed to change clothes). We finally received our luggage just before 7:30 and needless to say didn't really have time to freshen up a bit before dinner (actually just got to the restaurant at 8). Although the front desk manager apologized the next day, it really didn't matter to me at that point. She asked what she could do to make me happy and offered to comp a massage or a free meal. I just asked if it was possible to get an \"uneventful\" day from her staff (which was really all I wanted all along). She had a look on her face like she didn't even know how to respond to that request (as though that might be asking the impossible). I mentioned that I really didn't think I was asking too much to have our luggage delivered and perhaps her staff could have at least made sure we had some ice (they don't have ice machines so we had to call room service for ice). She was surprised by the ice comment and questioned whether we had had turn down service (apparently the maids are supposed to deliver ice every night). I informed her we never received ice in the 3 nights we had been there and I had to call for it (and of course, tip their room service which I thought was bogus). She did end up comping our lunch but honestly it just didn't matter. I can't stand it when a 5 star hotel provides shoddy service like this. There are plenty of deals out there especially with the economy being in the shape it's in (even for 5 star hotels). My wife actually chose the hotel (I was pushing for the Four Seasons). The last day at the hotel was our 25th wedding anniversary, but I was just too annoyed to really enjoy it. Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience.
0 ||| Worse place ever and I don't even know where to start.\nThe service was not on par when I had my warrenty and they basicly command me to give them a 100% rating or they had to haress me more and ask me why it is not 100% rating.\nI had an accident near the end of my service period and that lighted my engine light on, they simply turned it off and told me it is fine.\nMy warrenty was off and now it cost me 3000 dollars to fix my car and LISTEN TO THIS. I COULD DO THIS SERVICE FOR 1000 DOLLARS ANYWHERE ON THE FUCKING PLANET BUT THEY LIED TO ME ABOUT HOW IT CAN ONLY BE DONE AT THEIR PLACE AND CHARGED ME OVER 3000 DOLLARS AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT EVEN FIXED. So yes, 3000 dollars for a lesson of never using this crappy place again.\n\n\nP.S. They called me and asked me if I want to buy another car from them, and the answer was hell no.
1 ||| wow, i feel exactly like Calamari F. down there... I really want to love Last Chance, but I just don't think I'm the elbow -jab-to-the-face-over-a-pair-of-designer-jeans kind of shopper.\n\nthe finds can be amazing, absolutely, but you have to be the type of person who thinks of shopping as more of a sport and eat or be eaten activity. \n\ni thought if i avoided the weekend it would be better, but no way, this place is like a constant zoo and the lines (for dressing rooms and check out) are way too long for me to deal with. i usually end up there when shopping for a special occasion, like when i want to look super hot in a killer designer dress, but don't feel like shelling out the bucks for another stupid wedding.\n\nand yes, this is basically where designer clothes go before they end up in the big rack in the sky, so be sure to check for major stains, rips and broken zippers. i've never encountered someone stealing a find out of my basket, but it would not surprise me in the least.
3 ||| This place is pretty neat. The brews are decent, the staff is amazing, and the vibe is low-key. I always have a pretty decent time here and I love the watermelon ale. \n\nI wish they stayed open later (they close at 7 most nights apart from special events). Also, it is always HOT inside. Maybe upgrade the AC unit? \n\nThey don't do food here and that's a shame. However, the staff frequently arrange for a delicious food truck to hang out in the parking lot which helps quite a bit.
0 ||| First time in this WoB. From 9 attempts, 8 beers were sold out. Finally I found a beer from Poland which was in stock. I asked the bartender to see the bottle and later I realized the best before date was expired. (I told the server that it was expired, but no reaction from her)\n\nAfter drinking 3/4 of the beer (1 hour later), I felt very bad in my stomach and asked for water and a slice of bread. I got my water, but the server said that she would have to charge me for bread. So I took the cab back and my friends continued partying that night. \n\nWe all ate 6 hours ago the same kind of sub at subway and I was the only one feeling very bad. \n\nI'm German, so I am sorry for my non native English.
0 ||| Don't count on a roll-away for your family. They have a self imposed policy of 2 beds to a room and will not change no matter the circumstances, expectations, or that they advertise roll-aways available.
1 ||| I got a manicure here.  I had an appointment but they were still about 45 minutes late.  I got an apology but nothing else.  While I was waiting, I got to overhear a lovely conversation where a salon worker was trying to convince a customer that women can get pregnant from swimming pools.  Something about how they store sperm in water for IVF, so of course you can get pregnant from anonymous sperm in a swimming pool.  Sigh.\n\nI then got sent to one person to remove my prior gel manicure.  Which means she just left me to soak in acetone.  When she came back ten minutes later to take off the polish, she didn't get everything off and I kept having to point out areas that she missed.  Then I got sent to another person who actually did the manicure.  I wanted a normal manicure because I was getting sick of the gel manicure process.  The woman doing my manicure really tried to hard sell me on getting a gel manicure again, which annoyed me a bit.  She just quickly did the manicure and then put me in a corner under UV lights to stare at a wall with a bunch of cheesy feathers that people apparently put in their hair.  She didn't say how long I was supposed to sit there so I just sat there for ten minutes, paid, and left.  \n\nAre all nail salons this awkward and weird?  The quest continues for a nail salon that does not skeeve me out.
1 ||| This place used to have hands down the best chili on the planet, (I know it sounds odd considering it is a bakery) but I guess they have have changed the recipe from using brisket and big vegetables to using water and ground beef. It was like water the last two times. When i asked the guy behind the counter he said \"I don't know, it's just how they send it over\". 20 bucks for two bowls of water and two teas? No thanks.
4 ||| LOVE Hillstone it never dissapoints.  We ended up at Hillstone last night after being badly mistreated at another restaurant.  (an hour and a half wait that never got us a table)  We arrive at HILLSTONE  hungry & frustrated we explained to the host what happened..... He told us another 20 min. wait we went to the bar and before we had our drinks we had a table! Not to mention a complimentary appetizer and a really lovely waitress.  We were so grateful to be treated so well and the food was outstanding!  Hillstone saved our girls night out and cemented our love of the restaurant!
0 ||| I used to be a regular at this place since it opened and let me tell you this place has gone down hill. Japanese people tend to be the nicest people but the women waitresses at this place have got to be some of the rudest I have ever encountered. They barely acknowledge you and when you ask for something it arrives 15 min later. The tall waitress is by far the worst, and it feels like she is doing everyone a favor by just doing her job. It's too bad the service is so bad as that really kills the experience regardless of how good the food could be. If I were the owner I would read these reviews and fire those b*t**y women.
2 ||| OK,\n\nPizza delivered to my hotel.  Check.\nOpened up the box and the pie looked delicious. Check.\nPizza had ingredients as requested. Check.\nPizza cut in squares, like a true Chicago pie. Check\nPizza cut all the way through the dough. EPIC FAIL.\n\nMy oh my.  When you pick up a slice (Chizona's cuts the pie is squares) you want to pick up a slice with all of the ingredients on top of the slice.  Three of us (two who never had a Chicago style thin crust) and not one slice was cut all the way through.  In a hotel room, with no cutlery we tried our best to keep the ingredients on top of each slice, but pulling apart slices, that are not cut, created an awful mess.  We ended up with a bunch of hand pulled empty slices, and trying our best to put the ingredients on each slice.  We gave up.\n\nIf you cant cut a pie, which is so Pizza 101, than you create a crappy experience for your customer.  \n\n3 stars for the fresh ingredients, great sauce, the owner adding some Giardiniera (very fresh and tasty). Minus 2 stars for the mess that was created by the pizza not being cut all the way through.\n\nI had so much higher hope's.\n\nStay hungry my friends...
1 ||| I stayed here during the last week of June.  I think I stayed here 10 years ago and everything looks just the same. The nicest people at this hotel are, by far, the valet guys. It was SO hot out and they were friendly. Got back late one night to a full lot and the guy parked my car so I would not have to go back to creepy self-park all alone. So thanks valet dude. Check in didnt take long, dude was ok. It took forever to get our bags though. The casino reeks of smoke. Pee-youuuu.\n\nMy room was on floor 7, tower one. One good thing is that it does not take 30 min to get to your room, like at MGM. The room though...yuck. It's just old. I felt like i was time warped to the 70's. The beds.... Not good. One week later and my back and neck still hurt from the beds/pillows.  Fixtures and lamps and stuff were dirty. Bathroom was small, it was clean enough. Towels were very thin and stained. Maids we saw in the hallway were super nice and gave us what we needed. \n\nExcalibur hotel has a good food court. You also get a nifty little coupon book.  Would I stay here again? Only if I absolutely have to. My advice is spend the extra few bucks and get a nicer room at a newer hotel. \n\nEnjoy Vegas, baby!
3 ||| Every time we visit Vegas we HAVE to make a stop here, Yeah we have Amoeba (we live in LA) but I prefer a smaller setting where I wont feel like I'm having an anxiety attack because there is so much to choose from! I like the little novelty Items they carry and you can find some great gems if you look hard, I like how cheap the dvds are.
3 ||| I had the chance to try this place the other day on UNLV  campus. I ordered the Bloody Bay and it was so yummy!\n\nPrices weren't too bad and service was quick! Definitely, going back to try some of the loaded waffle fries!
3 ||| Alright, I was torn on this place until I decided I really liked it.  I lived right up the street and I ate here all the time.  I tried the majority of their menu and have concluded that this is great feel-good soul fuel food.  The noodles are scrumptious, the dumplings are plump, the potstickers are delicious, and sauces are wholesome, and the Korean BBQ pork is really good.  You get a lot of food on your portion, and you can carryout.  That said, the noodles can be a bit heavy, and the dishes can get a bit greasy.  Still, it all tastes really good and while I can't speak to authenticity, it certainly warms a lonely evening.
3 ||| Hey, It was my first time...as an adult...in Vegas; The Riviera was cheap.\nAlthough our room was facing construction, it was more than enough for us. What do you do when you're in Vegas?? SLEEP?! I think not....We used it for our day naps, and our opportunities to make some pre-drinks. We are a young couple and it was perfect for us. We took the deuce EVERYWHERE and drove the final day....perfectly convenient. The staff was, as said, low on customer service. Overall, It was exactly what we needed. We probably wouldn't stay there again, mostly because we loved some of the other casinos a little more.\nIf you're looking for a great deal, while still having a nice clean room to rest your head, check it out.
1 ||| Some common-a$$ food. Nothing to see here folks. Interior is lame too. Waitress was nice though. Go to Mac's or Mert's if you're in the mood for this type of food.
4 ||| The rocking chairs are genius!\n\nThey're perfect for weary travelers that just want to relax especially those of us in between flights. Ahhh genius.\n\nAnd did I mention the food, they have everything you might be craving and some new ideas that will get your mouth watering. \n\nThe staff was polite and helpful. \n\nSome other airports need to come study this airport's success and learn a thing or 20.
2 ||| Our waiter was the best, funny and point. We were there around 8pm. Place was packed. Once waiter took our order it long to get our food. The food was ok. I ordered the Lasagne it was good. I had better.  Their portiions are big. I was not able to eat half of it. Also to heavy to have this late. I could not sleep.\nThe desserts were very good. I will for sure be back for the desserts.
1 ||| For the past two Sundays, I've come here to hang out for a couple of hours while my Son is at a Church function.  I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.\n\nI was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\n\nI watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying \"Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!\".....she replied \"I know\"......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!\n\nThis is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nBack to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.\n\nThe Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.\n\nI took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.\n\nWill I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.
1 ||| I came here because I've heard good things about the reverse happy hour, although it was for the Gilbert location but since we were closer to this location we made the mistake of coming here. I asked to sit close to the fish tank so my daughter could enjoy the view and was told if we wanted to partake in reverse HH we would have to sit elsewhere. We were told we could sit on the other side at the only open table in view (still dirty) and proceeded to seat ourselves. After several minutes of waiting my daughter politely asked for our table to be cleaned. Our server finally appeared, our drinks and food came out at a snail's pace. The chicken satay over a slaw was good, peanut sauce good(have had better) whatever the other sauce was, awful. The apple brie and pepperoni flatbread were ok but quickly became cold because the air conditioner was on so high you'd think it was summer outside. Average food with poor service, the only reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1 was the nicest gentleman whose job only appeared to be to bus tables was polite to my daughter & myself, was personable and was the only one who genuinely seemed happy to be there. He deserves a mention, the tips and a raise. We might try hh again at Kona but definitely not at this location!
3 ||| One of the best reasons I'm happy to be alive is STEAK.  Life would be oh so boring without it.  For date night, we couldn't figure out where we wanted to eat at since we weren't too hungry and it was already 9:30pm...most places were closing at 10pm but thankfully, Gordon Ramsay keeps his doors open until 10:30pm.\n\nThe restaurant, especially the entrance, reminds me of a club...a well-lit club.  We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar area and didn't have to wait to get a table.  We were given an amazing plate of different kinds of bread. 2 were aged parmesan, 1 bacon, 1 mushroom and 2 lemony breads. In a world full of free sourdough bread, complimentary bread got exciting again. We got the medium rare 24oz dry-aged bone-in rib eye, fingerling potatoes and mac n cheese.\n\nDRY-AGED BONE-IN RIBEYE: their medium rare is bloodier than usual but I'd rather eat a bloody steak than a hockey puck.  It was tender and no sauce was needed. Just pure meaty perfection. 5/5\n\nFINGERLING POTATOES: with parmesan and truffle...they were flavorful. The perfect side for a awesome piece of meat 5/5\n\nMAC N CHEESE: with peas, truffle and 3 different cheeses - blue, cheddar and parmesan.  It was tasty, rich and quite heavy. 4/5\n\nFor personal reasons, we skipped dessert. The service was alright. For the price and quality of meat we got, I may have found a new favorite steak place in Vegas.  But no, I still love Mario Batali.
0 ||| Nope nope nope nope nope.\n\nThe coffee might be good and the decor may be trendy\n\nHOWEVER BEWARE!!!\n\nHUGE \"hip-ster\" crowd.\n\nI've never been so amused in my life!!\n\nThe crowd, huddled over their laptops mostly \"pretend\" to be working on them while others scoff at why one wears a Fruit of the loom T-shirt instead of an American Apparel. \n \nSnotty, snobby and downright disgusting \"wool cap\" wearing crowd who act like wanna be (but can't afford to be) Californians jam the place tight.\n\nBut, not my problem that your not \"understood\" or more obvious unemployed.\n\nIf you're looking to go to be \"seen\" having a cup of coffee I recommend Starbucks on Robertson here in Los Angeles, at least there it's okay and expected.\n\nAnd you can do all the \"freelance\" work you want YIPPPEEEE!
1 ||| The best part of this place is the scavenger hunt to find it. The location is ridiculously obscure. The hotel doesn't even have it listed on their website. The casino is 3 floors away, and unless you're LEAVING Marquee, you wouldn't have a reason to discover this pizza place.\n\nWe found a random hallway with albums all along the wall, and I knew from reading yelp that this was the place. There was a bouncer right at the mouth of the hall, and I was half expecting them to say something, but they just nodded and said, \"Enjoy the pizza.\"\n\nThen things started going downhill. The pizza was over-priced ($5 a slice for cheese) and mediocre at best. I had even been drinking, and it was just a let-down to be honest. The pizza was not a lot of food, and the crust was flimsy and a bit over-worked to have a nice chew/mouth-feel.\n\nThe toppings were typical of any hole-in-the-wall pizza place, and the slices waiting to be served harkened a less than stellar Sbarro feeling. The place looked out of place in the otherwise impeccable Cosmopolitan, and the drinks were served in red plastic solo cups. I'm not in college anymore, and I'm not at Circus Circus... please just give it to me in the bottle, or better yet an actual glass.\n\nThe line wasn't too bad when we arrived. (Around 9:00pm) But apparently it gets ape-shit when the clubs start to close down. If that was the case, I'd definitely not wait in line for this. But the 10 minute line wasn't that bad.... too bad the food wasn't even worth it.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say you're better off spending your Vegas money elsewhere. It's a unique idea, with a bad product. I'd highly recommend 800 Degrees Pizza in front of the Monte Carlo for a truly amazing pizza.
3 ||| Locally-owned coffee shops are the best. Always looking for a new place to try, I heard of Carmel's from a graduate student of mine. Tired of going to LGO, I decided to give this a try today. \n\nI ordered a medium chai latte. It was delicious - and I only ever get them at Cartel's! The guy behind the counter added a hint of cinnamon (how did he know that's what I usually put in my coffee?). The extra ingredient did it justice. \n\nI went around noon today and the place was semi-packed. Great music (a little bit of Jack Johnson) and I had a great Tuna Salad. The owner (or so I think) was very friendly. I was studying and he came by to thank me for coming in, which was nice. Also, there's a small patio in the back for people who want to read and enjoy the nice weather before it hits 100 degrees. \n\nI didn't have my laptop, but on my iPhone I saw that the Wi-Fi was locked. I didn't ask for the password, but I'm sure they would provide it if needed. Parking was scarce. Hard to find, but manageable. Overall, I would definitely come again for the chai latte!!!
0 ||| Bleh.  This place isn't even good when you are drunk.
2 ||| I found myself in a bind (and not the kinky kind) last Friday when, after spending all my allotted \"costume shopping time\" dealing with car issues, I faced the threat of having to appear at a Halloween party sans costume. Quelle horreur! \n\nI had six hours to find a costume that would befit a woman of my fabulous reputation. Deciding that this was far more important than, you know, helping students scan documents or walking professors through checking their e-mail, I picked up the office phone and started making calls.\n\nFirst I called Torrid. I wasn't thrilled at their selection, but I'm a fashion-minded plus-size girl, and they fit that niche. While I was tempted to get their flight attendant costume (I would've put on some corpse paint and gone as a \"Fright Attendant\"...get it? Get it? Fuck you, tool, I know I'm funny), Misty S and I have a rule about dressing up as each other's parents. I don't dress up as a flight attendant, and she doesn't dress up in an air force uniform. It's helped save our relationship.\n\nThey had a Ms. Lovett costume (\"The Barber's Mistress?\" Really?) but some hosebeast I work with and totally hate was going as that at another party, and she hand-made her costume and I could not possibly stand to have my costume compared to hers. So that went.\n\nI got the idea to go as Little Red Riding Hood. Having exhausted my options at Torrid and not quite daring enough to risk the vomitorium that is Party City, I looked up Easley's. \n\nBack when I was a mere Theater major (you called it, huh?) Easley's was synonymous with \"knows their shit\". Everyone who took costuming/cosplay/halloween parties (too) seriously went there. It was a name I could trust. In fact, I still have all the makeup I've bought from them over the years tucked away in a First Aid box (one day someone will figure out it doesn't contain gauze...but until then I can't afford a new box). So I gave it a try.\n\n\"Easley's, how may I help you?\"\n\"Yeah, I was looking on your site, do you have the Plus Size Miss Red Riding Hood costume in stock?\"\n*Sounds of checking inventory* \"No, we don't, but we do have the other one, with the long black skirt, and we found another one not on the site.\"\n\"Describe it to me, please?\"\n\"Corset with gold braiding, short black skirt, red hood.\"\n\"Oh wow. That sounds perfect. Can I have you hold it for me so I can come by and see?\"\n\"No. You have to pay for them online before we can hold them.\"\n\"But you said it's not available online.\"\n\"Oh, we're going to upload it to the site right now.\"\n\"Oh, okay, I see it...but...there's no picture.\"\n\"Yeah. We don't have a picture of it. It'll be $39.95.\"\n\"Wait, I'm supposed to pay for this sight unseen? Can't you just set it aside? I'll be there in like an hour. I can't afford to pay for this, drive over there and find that it doesn't fit, I don't like it, etc.\"\n\"Sorry, no, we can't.\"\n\"Ugh, okay. Thank you.\"\n\nDesperate (and a little curious) I went to order the mystery costume, and what do you know, not only was it invisble, but shape-shifting. Once in my checkout cart the price had changed (WITH MAGIC!) to 53.95. \n\nI called back. And was put on hold.  \n\nYeah, that's great, Endlessly Looping Sound Clip, but I really don't give a shit about the rental policy. I just want my costume.\n\nI ended up hanging up. I wasn't even sure I could afford the costume even if it was only 39.95.\n\nSo I went home, threw on the pink tafetta nightmare I wore at Fetish Prom, slipped on a domino mask and some high heeled boots and went as a prom queen dominatrix. I was the life of the party\n\nI know it sounds a little harsh of me to give them a 3 star for this one mixup, but seriously, I've never needed to get plastic involved to get anyone to hold something for me. I don't see what makes Easley's so special. What are the odds of another full-figured girl walking in within that hour time frame screaming \"QUICK! I NEED A SEXY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD STAT!\" \n\nI say relatively low, but that's only because I don't want to imagine that there's another me out there in the world. I'm enough.\n\nAfter the Halloween fervor I fully intend to stop by and see if they have that costume available still. Because it sounds fabulous. But I think it's important to know whether or not it'll make my ass look fat before I make the commitment.
3 ||| Great quality food and the servers are really nice!
2 ||| This is a *family* review of the hotel.\n\nWe chose the Excalibur because it was cheap and it was a Castle---the easiest choice for any parent taking their 4-year-old princess to vegas.  (We chose this over Circus Circus because of the proximity to M&M World & Rainforest Cafe). \n\nI was leary of all the negative reviews, but we took the chance anyway.\nHere is our 2 cents:\n\n1.  The 2-room suite in Tower 1 was updated and very nice.  King bed was super comfortable; two bathrooms, extra large jacuzzi tub; two tv screens.  Very clean.\n\n2.  The double-queen room was NOT updated, but was VERY clean.  Bathroom was large, no tub, nice shower.  Nothing special, but for a $40 price tag on the strip, we had no complaints.  (There just wasn't anything \"pretty\" or \"special\" about the room.\n\n3.  The pools are located near Tower 2.  If you want a room near the pools, then expect to pay a higher price because Tower 2 is considered \"contemporary\" accommodation, meaning ,they've been upgraded & remodeled.   Convenience is key when you want the pools, otherwise you'll be walking a mile from Tower 1 thru the heart of the casino each time you come/go.\n\n4.  The Excalibur is NOT the hotel for the young & hip.  Most of the crowds we noticed are older adults, or families.   This was nice--we were not barraged with obnoxious drunkards or \"sex.\" as stated in other reviews.  \n\nYes, there are a lot of rednecks here, but this has a few positive benefits!\na.  Rednecks spend most of their time playing the slots, so they don't bother you.\nb.  obnoxious youngsters trying to get laid do not hang out where the rednecks stay\n\nI will say this:  our weekend stay was quite pleasant.  The kids & families around the pool were polite (i'm really not kidding) and friendly.  We never once felt that we needed to shield our daughter from anything.  \n\nBased on other reviews we thought this would be the skankiest hotel ever, but it was quite the opposite.  I think theme-hotels are outdated, but there was nothing wrong with this hotel at all, unless you want to compare it to all the swanky $400/night hotels down the strip.\n\nBONUS:  convenient walkway to the Luxor--which is a huge hit for youngsters.  Also, a tram connects Excalibur, Luxor & Mandalay.\n\nM&M World is 0.5miles away from the front entrance of Excalibur.
0 ||| Update: after I tried to serve Bill and found out that his address was a fake I realized just what a pro he was. So I called from a different phone and scheduled another repair. He again told me many lies and elaborate stories and told me how he could give me a discount if I had cash. He told me how \"the wife doesn't know about cash ya know\" then he may have thought about how shady that sounded and changed it so he wasn't hiding money from his wife but how he paid cash for her birthday Yukon unlimited...wow that makes me feel better Bill...maybe the IRS should know this information! Anyway...I set up the fake appt so I could serve him for my day in court and it worked beautifully!! I think the others affected should come to the hearing and serve him as well and get him shut down!! Or set up your own fake appts.
4 ||| Monsterland is a unique and fun place to enjoy drinks, food and a great atmosphere.  The food is good and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The decor is a dream come true for all the monster lovers in AZ.  Thank you Monsterland for bringing a new and exciting desination to Arizona.
0 ||| Very poor customer service not to mention out of lemonade so wife had to drink water then she asked for a sauce pack and they tried charging her . Not the 1st time here that service was horrible waited a few weeks ago for over 20 min in drive thru because they gave our shakes to someone else in the dinning room ! The rudest one was  Alex says he's manager if so I feel sorry for this store not only the way he treated us but as we were eating hearing him talk down to the employees .
3 ||| this place is super inexpensive and really fast, great place to take a quick lunch break
1 ||| The last time I went I was sooo happy with the food now I'm sooo sad. The day before New Yrs Eve I was craving some good BBQ. I promised myself no more meat except fish starting New Years. So this was pretty much my last hoorah. I was looking forward to it ALL day!! I had a burnt ends sandwich with fries and onion rings. Well I couldn't even finish the sandwich! It was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty. About half way through my stomach started crying for help. I felt like dude on Man Vs. Food I was determined to eat it but it turned awful. I had to stop eating and I thought I was going to die. I had a gallon of tea after that and luckily pulled through alive. Not at all like last time. NOT ONE BIT!! Oh fries were not good either not like McD's they were pretty greasy more like Two Hippies but without the thickness. Onion rings were ok  meh nothing to write about.\n\nStill sad about the whole thing!
1 ||| Bad Service at the desk.
3 ||| Overall, good food, noble mission... It's a place that you feel good about eating a meal at :) \n\nI absolutely love the concept behind King's Kitchen. They are a not-for-profit restaurant that donates 100% of it's profits from sales to feed the community. Not only do they have a noble mission and vision, but they have tasty food! \n\nI had a group interview in Uptown and a few of us were looking for a lunch spot close by. It was the one rainy, cold, windy day that week and we were on foot. Someone suggested Jimmy John's but I refused to walk too far.  Luckily, The King's Kitchen was at the corner of the block. We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints. The other selections at the table looked tasty as well! The prices were fair, $9-13 for the lunch menu.  The service was attentive and everyone was very polite. I would like to return to try their dinner selections.
0 ||| i am not sure why there would be any review higher than 1.  ppl giving this place a good review must not had a decent buffet before.  everything we had was super salty.  the prime rib was raw, and all the fruits there are from cans.  the only things that were ok were the shrimp cocktails and the salad.  my friend had stomach sickness the same night after dining here.
1 ||| The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.
1 ||| Not really what I expected when I booked a hotel under the Hilton name. Sure they use the same bath products, but I've stayed at other Hiltons and the Las Vegas Hilton really needs a facelift. \n\nChecking in was easy -- and actually, I enjoyed it lot. The front desk attendant was courteous, talkative and very helpful. Turns out you have to pay a daily fee to enjoy to gym amenities, but since I'm a Hilton Honors member, we was able to get the fee waved. \n\nThe rooms are just old -- that's the bottom line. The varnish on my bathtub is peeling and the room had a musky smell. Beds are comfortable, but nothing extraordinary. My TV was also not working, and I called to the front desk to send up someone, but they never showed up. After a follow-up call two hours later, the TV technician arrived and said the outlet was blown, and fixed it in two seconds. \n\nRestaurant selection is minimal in the hotel -- you have to go to the strip if you want real food and shopping. I had a shrimp and pasta salad from their wine bar in the main lobby - avoid getting it at all costs. The shrimp looked microwaved (multiple times) and there was so much pasta, I started feeling sick after a few bites. \n\nOverall, definitely not the WORST hotel I've stayed at, but compared to others in the area, nothing that would make me want to recommend this place.
2 ||| Waaaay too crowded and smelled like a broken septic tank in the back corner.  I was there over Memorial Day weekend so I should have expected the crowd but they got greedy and tried to pack too many people into the TAO Beach part of the club.  \n\nI didn't even attempt to order a drink at one of the bars because it was easily going to take 20 minutes and that is only because I'm pretty tall and have a knack for working my way to the front of the bar (in the most gentlemanly way possible ladies).  \n\nOne highlight was that I didn't have to wait in line to get into TAO Beach.  I managed to talk my way in by telling the bouncer that I had a box and the VIP host told me we wouldn't have to wait in line.  Maybe that is true or maybe I'm just that good.  I'd like to think I'm just that good.  \n\nI would like to check TAO Beach out on a night that isn't so crazy in Vegas because the club looked great and had an awesome atmosphere.
2 ||| If you want dumplings, this is the place.  If not, dumplings are all they have.  This is CASH ONLY despite what Yelp lists.  It's in Chinatown where the restaurants are not all real clean.  This one falls in the middle.
3 ||| Close to the strip in between harrahs and ballys area in the Linq. Cool new concept, supposely all their slushies have top shelf liquor but I felt it wasn't strong enough, I believe I've gotten more drunk at fat Tuesdays slushies. They have more flavors though and we chose the patron grand mariner because it was sour.The staff is very friendly and cutely dressed, just needs more signs on the cups of drinks. The saxophone cup is seriously amazing! I think its the sexiest and bangest cup there is. ;) Ha ha
3 ||| I have a lot of health issues and a very limited diet.  Trying to stay alkaline, and keeping raw, I have found many delectable options.  My first visit, I tried the raw chile rellano, then the raw coconut curry spring rolls which were PHENOMENAL!  I also got to try a raw vanilla cupcake with coconut strawberry frosting. This is currently my favorite raw food venue.
3 ||| I love this studio! \n1. Beautiful and clean! \n2. none of that squiggly rubber carpet, or worse real carpet (think first generation bikram studios) \n3. An array of classes... Pilates, bootcamp, power yoga, yin. \n4. Very affordable \n5. None of the annoying pushy ::cough cough vegas hot cough cough:: down your throat tip your instructors crap \n6. nice patrons... You won't feel out of place if you've never down dogged \n\nThe only thing I wish was different is: \n1. wish there was a key fob type check in... I hate having to say my name to a person at a desk\n2. I wish there were some 75 min or 90 min class... all the classes are 60 min... 60 isn't enough sometimes but doing a double can be a bit much
4 ||| Carl's Jr.....Good place for burgers.  I always enjoy their guacamole burger which is grubtastic!  ;)  This location is also pretty quick about serving their food especially when your on your lunch break which is an advantage over other locations I've been to.  Place is neat, clean, and staff are friendly.  :)
4 ||| We had intended to go to another restaurant in the area that we discovered was closed. So, we thought we would try this new place and were pleasantly surprised. I had the corned-beef hash wrap from the breakfast menu and it was delish! It came with a generous side of fruit. My companions had the bleu cheese bacon burger and the roast beef baguette. My only complaint is that they don't have brewed iced tea. Otherwise, we had no problems and would definitely return.
2 ||| Mediocre steakhouse - nothing was knock my sock off delicious. Everything was kind of average. \n\nSommelier was spot on\n\nSo many better options to choose from based on pure food in LV. \n\nA reminder to self - to not to go back.
2 ||| Its a bit pricey but the dumplings and service are good.
1 ||| Nails came out nice.. BUT.. I did tell the guy to add glitter to one nail  but he completely ignored me, they also lied about how much they would charge me to begin with , they added a $15 fee for Idk , and when i asked them about it he gave me attitude I don't think I'll be coming back!  The guy doing my nails was super  rude .
3 ||| Slightly above average mexican food. One thing that keeps me coming back is they have excellent hot sauce. Service is always good. Very friendly staff. They do make great nachos maybe I should add a star!?!?
1 ||| Bookmans is a neat, orderly store that has a ton of books - most of them are in pretty good condition.  It's a charming place where you could spend all day wandering through the aisles reading.  It's quiet, the staff are friendly, and there's a lot to see.\nHere's what I hate about Bookmans:  I'll bring dozens of books and magazines in only to be told they want to buy only one or two items.  Then they offer 50 cents in cash or a 75 cent store credit.  No one gets rich selling to Bookmans.\nThe other problem I have is that they have a website, but their inventory isn't available to the public.  Every time I ask if they have a book, they tell me to call every few days because it can't be looked up.  What do they think this is - 1970?
3 ||| Great \"modern mexican\" place.  Don't go here looking for anything authentic.  It is certainly on the pricier side of mexican food, but it is fairly priced for what it is.  \n\nWe ate here late on a Saturday night and got the \"front and center\" outdoor table.  We had a blast, as the people watching on a nice night is outstanding (WHERE do all of these crazies come from, really!!??)\n\nSo long as you know what you are walking into here, you'll have a great experience.
4 ||| Absolutely delicious. I have never had pita chips like these and quite honestly...I am spoiled now!  Everything we had was wonderful and we made sure to let the guy who runs the place know it!  Will definitely revisit!
4 ||| Wilkendorf's is a fourth generation family-run tea house and is considered to be one of the best tea houses in Germany.\n\n\n They have certainly spoiled me with regards to my tea; I have failed to find a tea shop with a selection nearly as good as theirs. They travel to India, China and Japan on a regular basis to choose their tea, which reflects itself in the quality of their assortment.\n\n\n Besides tea, they have a good selection of accessories; you can find anything from tea water thermometers to crockery.\n\n\n Highly recommended if you should ever visit Karlsruhe and like your tea. Very good Chinese and Japanese green teas, and Darjeelings. \nMy favourite mixed tea is their 'Jubil\u00e4iumsmischung', the perfect breakfast tea.
2 ||| Pink's is located right outside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. Small inside, however large patio outside. If you haven't tried a Pink's Hot Dog, you have to if you're in Vegas. It's fast and easy, but not the cheapest. But is anything is Vegas cheap?\n\nEverything is made to order which is nice; I ordered the Bacon Chili Cheese Dog with a side of Onion Rings. The bacon was crisp, the chili was nice and meaty, but the cheese seemed like liquid nacho cheese...however, the onion rings were fresh. \n\nMy friend's tried the Planet Hollywood Dog and they enjoyed that as well.
3 ||| This review is strictly for the lounge/bar area.  I loved the ambiance and decor here, with the balcony overlooking the casino and the changing color lights.  Super soft leather seating and of course pricy ass drinks.  But boogey enough that I was impressed since this was indeed Vegas!
0 ||| I have been to this Walmart four times now, and each time I go, it is never a good experience, not even an acceptable one. I went today, and there was empty shelves in all I'll. They hardly had any stock\nIt's dirty in there, and none of the employees are happy that they have a job. I know I know, I shouldn't expect too much excitement from a Walmart employee, but still, they don't have to be rude\nAvoid this Walmart at all costs, I know I will from now on
3 ||| PROS:\nIf you have been boycotting Starbucks for a long time, this is the place to escape to. \n\nThey have a coffee drink called 911. \n\nStaff is really cool and one informed me that they give proceeds to MDA. \n\nCONS: \nA small menu of coffee to choose from. \n\nNo shady area to sit. You have to drive thru and go find that shade elsewhere.
1 ||| If this were a review on service alone I would give 5 stars.  Our server, April, was very nice and attentive to our table.  \n\nI found the food to be a bit on the bland side.  My steak and mushroom crock was topped with instant potatoes.  The meat was tender and the mushrooms were fresh, but the instant potatoes were a deal-breaker for me.  \n\nMy friend's lunch was pretty bland to her.  I did not taste it.  \n\nI will have to give this place another chance at a later date.  Their hamburgers looked really good.
3 ||| Morton's has a fine reputation, and for the most part it lives up to it. The Steaks are sublime, though I wasn't as keen on the asparagus or potatoes here... I am not sure their prices are always in line.\n\nThe drinks are all top shelf and worth every penny.
3 ||| Latest mega-resort in Vegas owned by MGM.  It's going to eat the lunch of alot of the older casinos.  Really nice modern design and impressive silhouette from the outside...this place makes the MGM look like a boutique hotel.\n\nRoom was phenomenal, better than either Mandalay or the Hotel rooms I've had.  Super cool fixtures (everyting connected to LDC computer, one touch drapes, etc.).  Awesome bathroom with glassed off shower & bathtub next to each other in a space bigger than most Vegas entire bathrooms.   Would definitely stay there again.
0 ||| 1. The place was filthy! the window we sat at had algae and/or mold over the entire surface. The ceiling had water damage and had been spottily fixed. (Imagine what you can not see.) \n2. From the time we ordered the soup and salad portion took 40 minutes. Dinner was far over 60 minutes. \n3. We had to get up and find someone to get our drinks refilled for just water and tea. 4. The appetizer orders were half wrong. \n5. One dinner order was wrong. No manager came to talk to us or apologize for a thing. \n6. Potatoes came without sour cream..others came without butter. (which never came)\n7. Staff was not at all friendly or nice. They kept saying they were extremely busy but the dining room had only two tables with customers.....and there were more than 5 servers with at least two boys for busing, so I have no idea what they do when actually busy. \n\nIf you are looking for a nice marina atmosphere try Red Fin Blues Instead. SKIP THIS PLACE COMPLETELY!
2 ||| I came here for lunch around 2pm. Unfortunately the waiter took a while to take my order as he forgot that I was there. The yumcha was not bad. Coming from Sydney Australia, it's hard not to compare it to the yumcha places in Sydney, like Phoenix. Definitely not as good, but not bad for a place in Montreal. \nPaid for the meal with a 28degrees credit card but the machine was not accepting it so I had to go to an ATM to withdrawal and pay in cash.
2 ||| This is really one of the more disappointing BBQ places in Phx.  I hate to disrespect Honey Bears but their pulled pork is just too dry.  I shouldn't have to cover it in your bbq sauce (which isn't THAT good either) in order to make it edible.  Also, if you are going to churn out dry pork, you have got a lot of nerve charging for more bbq sauce.  I've never had anything else here but the fact that the pork isn't all that good is all I need to know.  I'll stick with Stacey's down the road.
4 ||| I'm a big fan of Kaiseki Ryori because of it's delicacy, simplicity, and elegance.  Now days, I noticed that quiet a few Japanese restaurants are specialized in a foreign cuisine in Vegas and I am very happy to try them out :) \n\nWe stumbled upon this restaurant on Saturday evening around 5:30pm.  With my small knowledge on Japanese/Italian fusion cooking techniques, I was just assuming that there aren't many dishes can be created into Japanese flavored pasta dishes on the menu besides conventional dishes.  All I could imagine and think of ingredients were some sort of flying fish roe on angel hair pasta, sesame oil flavored dish, yuzu citron sauce, or the dish with ginger garnish.  Well, I was wrong.  There were so many items to choose from.  And also, they had 7 to 8 different style of dishes for Special of the Day. \nFinally, we decided to share two dishes from the Special Menu:\n1. \"Casago Black Mussel ($25.95)\"\n     -Very tender & sweet fish\n     -Small size of winter black mussels w/ tangy tomato sauce(it was sure to  impress!!)\n2. \"Scallop & Shrimp Pasta (under $20)\"\n     -The texture of pasta was just right\n     -Good portion for two people\n     -Scallops & Shrimps were well cooked( not tough or rubbery tasty at all)\n*I was thinking that the chef was making sure these two ingredients were comparable in size so they had similar cooking time for the best taste :) \n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and very charming ambiance.  It was definitely a cozy dining experience for me.  Maybe, they could accommodate no more than 30 customers at one time.  There are still many dishes I'd love to try out from the menu, like Black Squid Ink Pasta and some other creative desserts.  The servings are on the medium to large sizes which encourage sharing with companions.  After experiencing Japanese Italian dishes, I want to say that they are a perfect culinary marriage!
0 ||| My family went there for dinner for the first time tonight and it was a TERRIBLE experience. The service and the overall presentation of the restaurant were decent. The food, however, was so bad that everyone got a stomach ache. I think we all had food poisoning. The food was also either bland or very salty. We did not try the Mongolian grill section, so I cannot speak on behalf of that. Will I go back, no.
1 ||| The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return.
4 ||| I really liked this branch.  The personnel I dealt with, from the teller, banker, to the manager are all so nice, helpful, and best of all knowledgeable.  This is the nicest banking center I have encountered by far.  \n\nThe only thing I don't like is the busy location.  Traffic-wise...geez how I hate driving on Maryland PKWY.  Nonetheless, this banking center is big, many PBs on duty, excellent customer service (for me at least).  \n\nI will go back as it is convenient and of course, having knowledgeable PBs and management personnel is the best when it comes to one's finance.
0 ||| Review for the sportsbook specifically-\n6 months ago, this was the best sportsbook on The Strip. Now the TVs are blocked off by a terribly placed bar, and anything resembling comfortable seating is blocked off as Members Only (regardless of the fact that seating was only at half occupancy at most). It's insulting placing hundreds of dollars in bets and being given a shitty conference room chair to sit in. If you want to see a good sportsbook gone terribly wrong, head to Caesars.
3 ||| food wise it would be a 2.5 - 3 at the most, but the place and the coffee made it up for the 4th star.\n\nLet me start with the food. If you've never eaten authentic Spanish dishes, you'll be pleased. Otherwise you'll be disappointed. \n\nThe olives were good. \n\nThe shrimp dish (gambas al pil pil) was also decent.\n\nThe traditional paella was good but more a risotto than a paella. Too creamy, different kind of rice (at least the texture is different) but the saffron hint and the chorizo were tasteful.\n\nThe tortilla was ok. A little burn and dry but pretty decent.\n\nThe wine selection is limited and most of the wines are NOT Spanish, AYFKM? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, you have a Spanish themed place and no Spanish wine?\n\nNow the coffee. I tried the cold brew and the kopi luwak. Both pretty good. The coffee paraphernalia is also worth the visit! If you are caffeine sensitive, this might not be for you.\n\nI didn't check if in the menu they include \"cafe bombon\", a Spanish classic. I'll go back to verify that and if not, at least to get good coffee!\n\nCheers
3 ||| We have eaten take out many times from here and the food tastes pretty good. Orange chicken is good but not the best. \nThe curry is really delish.
4 ||| We went at around 3:10 and got to eat the lunch menu (with kobe beef balls, St. Lous style ribs, fried chicken, etc. ) and then we got to eat their dinner menu at 3:30 with crab legs, cocktail shrimps, mussels, lamb, etc.).  I've eaten at Bellagio and Mirage and this place totally blew them out of the water.  You get what you pay for and this place certainly gives you what you pay for.  Almost everything tasted great here.  You can really taste the quality and time that the chefs put into creating and cooking the dishes that they have.  I could eat here everyday!!!  :)
2 ||| I came here with a group for drinks before a group dinner...didn't like that you couldn't seat yourself at the bar without the hostess helping you.  We tried some drinks and french fries...all were good, albeit overpriced, but nothing to rush back for!
2 ||| The segara boregi was absolutely delicious... that being said, I expected more from the lamb and the chicken kebabs I ordered. It wasn't even the fact that it wasn't on a stick, it was the portion size. For the price I payed I expect more than 2 ounces of meat. Basically I payed $9 for a bland portion of rice. The only reason I would consider returning would be to fill up on the appetizers.
3 ||| Need a break from the super pricey Vegas Strip that eats a hole into your wallet? Pop's is a breath of fresh air with its decent pizza at a reasonable price. It is a nice place to decompress and blend in with the wall coverings.\n\nPizza was hot, slices were big and ingredients seemed fairly fresh.
1 ||| There are only two good things about staying at the MGM Grand hotel in Vegas. The location and the bed. First of all the super gay employee who checked us in had an attitude when he told us there was a $200 fee to check in and we only had cash. I had no idea of the fee to begin with. Then we were never able to log in with their WiFi connection. Super complicated and it never worked not even offline my phone couldnt connect. I dont know if they have a signal jammer or what. The walk to the room was half a mile. I guess we made the mistake of staying when that loser miley cyrus was booked so the hotel and the parking lot was jam packed with the fall of americas future clogging up the hallways, elevators and parking garage. Spent over $500 for a 3 night stay which was really worth maybe $200. Im Definitely choosing a better place next year.
3 ||| Once again I find BCBG is a go-to place to get a party dress.  I have two upcoming trips to Vegas so I stopped in to check it out and I was not disappointed.  The store is pretty large for a BCBG and all the sales associates were very helpful and friendly.   I easily found 7 dresses to try on and there was another 7 I thought about. (And I may just go back to try them....)  They have a lovely shoe section as well.  BCBG has great end of the season sales, make sure to hit them up.\n\nI think that I am probably going to start branching into their regular tops and pants soon, and it will no longer be just be a party dress destination.
4 ||| Had two new Sushi Rolls here!\n\nBeing vegan longer then Ive been eating sushi, means that I really haven't had allot of different types of sushi. Usually I am in luck if the Miso Soup doesn't have fish, and they have inari, avocado, cucumber, or mushroom rolls.\n\nI asked the waiter if they had any vegan dishes, and to my surprise he was very knowledgeable about veganism, and all of the ingredients included in each dish.\n\nI chose two of his recommendations as this was to be a mini meal while walking around the veags strip.\n\nUME SHISHO ROLLS\nMint, Radish?, and another item (I cant remember what) \nThis was AMAZING!! so good, and taste changing cool yet spicy so unique!)\n\n\nKENKO ROLLS\nKampyo, Asparagus, Napa Cabbage, Avocado, Cucumber, Oshinko\n(crunchy textures, clean taste)\n\nPrice was a little high even though we got one of the cheaper sakis, but was still worth it. \n\nTheir Sake and Japanese Beer list is very extensive.\n\nBesides the new favorite sushi rolls, the architecture in here was beautiful, we sat at the bar and looked at the squares and lights, that I think someone must have handmade as the pattern doesn't repeat and it seems like someone had to cut each plexi class square, unbelievable to look at and imagine!\n\n-I'll be back! - \n\n& hopefully make it to the real Shibuya in Japan someday ;)
2 ||| Once just a Panera ripoff, Atlanta Bread has since added many more of its own creations. I tried the Italian vegetable panini the other night: tasty but expensive, given the portion size. Even after finishing the pickle and kettle chips that came with it, I felt barely satiated.\n\nDecor is nice, as is the free wifi, but service is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, this place feels like an adequate option if you're in the mood for a sandwich. (The pastas, however, are quite bland.)
0 ||| The rooms are disgusting.  I have pictures of the stained floor, and mildew stain on the outdated ceiling.  Carpet is so bad, we would not walk on it barefoot.  Manger would not help us out, front desk would not move us either.  Patio door would not shut all the way.  Room smelled of mildew and when shower was turned on there was an odor too.  Furniture in the room is very old, stained and disgusting.  I would never stay here again, it is about as close to a health hazard as you can get.  We had the Do Not Disturb Sign on the door and housekeeping still came into the room!  The only good thing about this hotel (I can's say it is a resort) is the Hash House a Go Go restaurant which is amazing.  Don't stay at this hotel, just go there to eat.
0 ||| Yuck!  I can not believe this place has got some good reviews.  I was in Vegas 3 weeks ago, went to the Tao.  The alcohol in my stomach was feeling lonely so we went to Noodle Asia after leaving the club at around 12:30AM on a Saturday night.  On a busy night, I would imagine a full staff of waiters and cooks... Not this night, 2 waiters, 2 cooks and 1 hostess.  We had two couples ahead of us in line to be seated.  \nWait time for a table- 50 minutes.  \nTime after ordering our food until it arrived to our table- 45 minutes.  \nTime to eat-5 minutes flat.  \nTime it took for the waiter to take to print out our check- 15 minutes.    \nThe soup I ordered tasted like dish wash water.  \nService-  abrupt/borderline rude\n\nNext time, I'll skip this joint and opt for room service.
3 ||| Great alternative healthcare/medicine service in the Queen City! $20-$40 gets you a treatment! The acupuncturist was really nice and gentle, offering a warm welcome as I entered the office.\n\nBring your ipod and headphones. Although they do a very nice job of keeping it quiet, you still hear the occasional shifting of clients, sweeping of floor, or whispering. They keep it at 74 degrees and it is comfortable, but if you get chilled easily (if your Qi isn't balanced yet), then bring something light to put over you. \n\nIt was a lot more organized, clean, and cozy than I had anticipated. The bathrooms are located down the hall, outside of the suite and are very clean and modern. The ambiance is very soothing and inviting! I thought it would be a bit strange reclining in a large room with strangers while needles are sticking out of my body, but interestingly enough it wasn't weird at all.\n\nBring cash, you can also ask for a receipt to use your flex spending account. Register online, do the paperwork at home and save $15. \n\nI'm happy that they opened! I really like how they offer affordable alternative healthcare for everyone on every budget. Give it a try if you haven't done acupuncture yet! You may need to commit to 5 treatments or so to see a difference (at least that is what I'm going to do). If you have questions, they offer a Thursday session for you to get your questions answered since you really cannot get into details of your treatment at the time of service (do to the community setting). At the end of the treatment, I found that I like the community setting because it's another experience for you and a friend/spouse/partner to share!
3 ||| This place is pretty interesting....they may call themselves \"Yummy Grill SUSHI\" but it's not just a Japanese restaurant.  Besides that, they got  your Chinese and Thai dishes. I think I saw someone ordering Indonesian fried rice too. I wanted to order drinks too but eh...I forgot to and by the time I remember, I wasn't really in the mood. Oh wells...save some unneeded calories, right? =) lol\n\nSo for those who may not be in the mood for sushi but someone in your party does, have no fear...there are other choices available that I'm sure will suit your taste buds.
3 ||| Chipotle's my default healthy-ish fast food option.  They make a big deal out of how they source their food, and if you get your burrito bowl-style and leave off the cheese, you can actually avoid blowing through a thousand calories on your lunch break.\n\nThis particular location is very close to my apartment, so I go there fairly often.  The staff is usually polite and they usually get my order right.  That's really all I ask when I go to a chain restaurant, since the food is (or should be) standardized.\n\nAlso, Chipotle is leagues ahead of Qdoba, Salsaritas, Moe's, etc.  This is an Adam Fact (TM).
4 ||| This place is hands down the best place to get your phone fixed. I received great customer service and it was a really quick fix !! :) I will definitely recommend this place to everyone. If I could I would give 10 stars. Very satisfied with the work and customer service :)
3 ||| Good meal, good food.  Very good wait staff.  A wee bit expensive, but that was minor compared to the quality of the food and the apparent cleanliness of the restaurant.  We were amazed at the number of folks that kept streaming in for carryout.  Since we've never been to the restaurant, the locals must have already discovered this little gem.  I'd almost give it five stars, but would want to try other items on the menu first.
3 ||| My husband and I stayed here in February 2012 for USA Sevens. We picked it because it was on the strip and was better priced and looked the cleanest then the other hotels. We stayed in the East tower , which I do recommend staying at because it's the newest part of the Luxor and the cleanest. The ONLY thing we really couldn't stand was how far the parking lot is to the tower. Between going through the entire casino, bars, and the whole pyramid to the other side it was horrible after a 9 hour drive with a bunch of luggage! The room it self was really nice, the desk chair was a bit dirty . But all in all we would stay there again. The Luxor buffet was the best one we've been to compared to a few others on the strip. It was clean and had great options for breakfast.
1 ||| Outline: Very slow service, iffy food.\n\nOk, I gave it 4 tries. This time it really did it. \n\nI would give three stars for food. Here is why: I don't think it's anything great, but it's not too bad either. Although yesterday my husband refused to finish any of the dishes and my 3 year old is literally throwing up as I write this. Last night he had fried rice and soup (she hadn't eaten anything else for dinner - very slim chance of a coincidence).\n\nAll four times I've been there, it takes 40 minutes to an hour + to get done. And we are usually \"fast\" eaters. We sit down, we know what we want, we eat, and we're out. We go out every day and don't have time to sit around and talk like some people do.\n\nOk, I can understand that also, but when it takes 10 minutes between asking for a check and actually getting one there is something wrong here. My husband had already left by then as my 3 year old had enough of sitting there that long. Good thing I paid with cash or I wouldn't be able to wait for another 10 minutes for them to run a card.\n\nAs much as I want to like it, I can't, and I won't be going back.
2 ||| I drove past today, pulled a screechin' u-turn, and excitedly headed into this brand-spankin' new Eastern European market. \n\nI was pleased to find the store had a solid offering of Eastern European and Russian foods.  I am not ashamed to admit that I am a Eastern European food addict.\n\nLucky for me, this place has the largest deli selection of any Eastern European store in Las Vegas.  The refrigerated cases have dozens of meats, salamis, sausages, cheeses, and salads.  They also offer a produce section that is refrigerated -- also a first for Las Vegas Eastern European stores (that I've seen).  They also offer baked goods from the awesome Natalia's Bakery located on Rainbow.\n\nThe packaged foods seemed mostly targeted to Russians, Bulgarians, and Hungarians.  I did see some familiar Polish stuff like Delicje and other Polish candies.   I was pleasantly surprised to find some frozen vareniki and pelmeni that I hope to try in the future.  And, dude, they have Dadu ice cream! DADU!!  It's the small things like this in life that make me happy. \n\nThe shelves were a little bare in some places and I hope they fill them out soon with a bit more variety of packaged goods.  I'm excited by their potential but, unfortunately, they don't offer many of my \"can't-live-withouts.\" I'll definitely be back to score some Dadu and to check out their progress.   Just keep opening the Euro markets and I'll keep shopping!
1 ||| Service is good.. Food is terrible. Low quality, bad preparation....  If the quality to price was more in line I would've given it a higher rating because I don't generally have high expectations for chains but in this case I just don't think the value is there.
4 ||| I had the tabouli salad here over a year ago and when my boss said lets eat at the Arrogant Butcher that's all I could think of. I had it again today and again....Amazing! We topped it with this peanut butter dessert!! Can u say wow??
4 ||| I live near this shop. The reviews guided me to this establishment. I tried to call before going and much to my disappointment YELP CONTAINS THE wrong number. The correct number is 702-434-9333
3 ||| I ordered General Tsao's chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, and egg drop soup. The portions were generous, and everything was fresh. The General's chicken had just enough vegetables, and sauce. The egg rolls were crispy, and tasted like they had just rolled them. The fried rice tasted made to order as well. Will definitely be a regular customer.
0 ||| Terrible! went there for lunch.\nSushi had only rise, I had a hard time finding or tasting the fish. Rise was undercooked. Wasted my time and money. I suggest you Try New Zealand, although their location is not as prime.
4 ||| I did what I always do when I'm hungry and unfamiliar with an area, I checked out yelp. \n\nThai Plates had a 5 star rating with a whole pile of rave reviews, so how could I resist trying this place?  As it turns out, all of the reviews are well deserved.  I had the Pad Prik King, which is the dish I order at every Thai place to compare.  It was awesome. So was my wife's broccoli with peanut sauce. And everyone is right about the amazing service. \n\nI love this place and only wish it were closer to home. I would definitely eat here again. And again.
4 ||| I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back.
2 ||| Not impressed at all...  I must admit...  The operations of this club needs some serious thought and attention.  Outside of the club there is nothing but chaos to get in.  It does not matter if you are on the list or have a bottle service.  After eventually getting in (and being late for the bottle service) we were given a shitty table and because that was all that was available we decided to not do the bottle service.  The managers were actually nice about it and did let us stay and have fun in the club but I must say it was not that much fun.  The downstairs had a cool layout and the walk to the upstairs balcony was pretty cool but the people there were not very cool.  All in all I do not know how to make it clear that this was not the best place to be but give it a try if you can and I must say if you are going to have a bottle service make sure you get a table upstairs and outside.  That is the best place to be for one of those.. good luck all... ( I did get complemented on my dress about a million times so that made up for some of the night and the bouncer on the way out stopped me to tell me I was beautiful so if anything I got an amazing ego boost at this place so that is a plus but the club itself is only so so)
1 ||| When I first moved to Lawrenceville Geno's was one of the first restaurant I experienced. I sat at the bar one afternoon and ordered a beer while chatting up Geno himself. I ordered an Italian sub that was phenomenal and left his restaurant feeling like I had just found a gem.\n\nI wish the review ended there, but it doesn't. In just a year and a half Geno's has really fallen to the wayside. He doesn't seem to get any business which then affects his product, spiraling his restaurant in that culinary catch-22 of lack of business/lack of quality that is basically the death throes of any eatery.\n\nOn my last visit, I was more than a little disappointed. The server was almost nonexistent and many of their menu items were unavailable. I ordered the Italian sub again and she walked away before I could order a size. What I ended up with was half a sub for dinner. I'm a big guy and a 1-foot sub consumer.\n\nMy girlfriend's meal was also sub par and expensive. Geno's is now erratically open and I can't imagine ordering a meal there, their hours are so random I find it hard to believe that they serve anything fresh.
0 ||| This restaurant is NOW closed. OUT-of-Business. R.I.P.
1 ||| We went to this Bistro based on a recommendation. It wasn't very busy when we first went in & were able to put in an order right away. My friend & I both decided on the Rosemary Chicken Panini. Considering how busy it was (not too busy), it took a pretty long time to get our food.\n\nEach sandwich was served with a small portion of greens topped with their mustard vinaigrette. I don't care much for greens but I'd say that the mustard vinaigrette was the best thing on the plate. I will preface by saying that I had made a substitution to my sandwich (ordered it with pesto instead of sundried tomatoes) but it didn't matter much since it didn't have the taste of pesto anyway. I thought the garlic spread had a really strong flavor and there was way too much cheese. There was also an off taste to the sandwich ... I'm not sure what it was. After only a few bites, I was tired of it.\n\nThe cookies looked so tempting that even though I wasn't too impressed with my meal, I thought I'd give it a chance. Probably should've thought twice because it got busier at the cash register & they switched cashiers to someone who wasn't at all efficient. It wasn't worth the few dollars I paid or the 10 minutes I waited for it. I'm not sure if I'll be back here.
0 ||| Stopped in when they were busy, ordered and waited for more than 20 minutes for 1 smoothie before giving up.\n\nEnded up asking for our money back - their excuse - \"We're not making them in any particular order\".
3 ||| Tonight was my first night checking out the Grotto, and after a bad service experience with another place close by, i was ready to eat anywhere at that point. \n\nI have passed the Grotto many times living in Scottsdale, and have often walked by smelling the aromas grazing my senses while strolling by...i love that they seem to always have their doors/windows open and the tables overlooking the street are fantastic.  \n\nAnyway, as Brett S. said , the service can be a little bad but it is definitely part of the charm.  Anyone who has every been to a real Italian \"joint\" understands this.  I was almost pleased with how traditional the feeling was, as in \"if you don't like it, get the heck out\" haha. It was also a very packed Friday night around 730, so i truly expected nothing but a wait anywhere we went, but we at least found a group of down to earth people entering and exiting wearing everything from jeans and a t-shirt like me, golf attire, to going out clothes. No matter your style, they treated you all the same.  Perfect!  (finding a place like that in Scottsdale is hard to do!)\n\nWith it being a Friday night and already having a bad experience with a previous place, i just wanted a square meal and to head home, so i didn't do as much sampling as i would have liked.  We started out with the calamari which came with a marinara sauce with a little kick to it.  It looks like they added red pepper flakes at the end, but it was a nice touch.  I had the house salad with vinaigrette dressing...and word to the wise, if you don't like onions, this salad (at least with the vinaigrette) comes with sneaky chopped marinated red onions in it...so beware! The blue cheese crumbles were a nice touch as well.\n\nMy friend ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo and i chose the cannelloni. The fettuccine was much smaller portioned than i thought it would be, especially in comparison to my dish...so if you're very hungry, i would stray from this dish.  While normally a classic favorite, i didn't quite like the added spices to the dish, which seemed to be an Italian seasoning.  The alfredo sauce alone was to die for though.  The cannelloni was phenomenal.  Everything was cooked to perfection and flavored out of this world. \n\nPlease also note....when this food is done, it's coming to your table, steaming hot! So wait a few before you take your first bite because you'll probably burn your mouth in some way/shape/form! :o)\n\nOverall the Grotto really picked up my night, and being a yankee in a western state...it's nice to have a piece of home right around the corner.  I'll definitely be coming back!
0 ||| I knew it was a bad idea to insult my taste buds with Wendy's salt lick menu but my little girl needed to make a restroom stop so   We started our dissatisfied adventure. \n\nRestrooms were just as clean as the tables, not so nice! The counter guy was pleasant considering he was overwhelmed with his tasks. Trying to catch up from forgetting portions of people's orders while trying to take hours. He did have a good attitude tho! \n\nReceived our food and I had a nice long black curly hair sticking out of the box before I even opened it to find it nicely tucked into my hamburger. As I approached the counter, the manager was actually on the way out of the back so I was able to bring it to her attention. She quickly apologized and brought me out a new cheeseburger immediately. She thanked me for not yelling at her, which is very much appreciated considering both of us know how people can be with situations like this. Overall, Wendy's in general but this location not ring exempt has always been a bit of a let down to me. I do have to give a shot out to the manager though for her exceptional customer service!
1 ||| I had a huge burger and it was ok. I would have liked a little less quantity and more quality. Not a place I would return to. I ate about 1/3 my meal and was disappointed. The tractor is cool.
2 ||| Decent food that you'd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in Mexican food. In short nothing to write home about...
0 ||| This was one of the worst Chinese food meals I've ever had. Diabetics should steer clear of the General Tao chicken -- it would be less sugary if they just doused it in maple syrup. I've had better food out of a catering truck at half the price.
4 ||| It was Saturday night in Vegas, we wanted sushi, and Nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. I quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and I am happy to say that I am ecstatic I did this, because had i not, I would have missed out on the Black cod with miso.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that I have ever tasted. \n\nMy BF and I shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!\n\nYellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno - DELICIOUS!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. I couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)\n\nLobster Ceviche - I have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but I wish we would have ordered something else instead. It was merely OK,  It just kind of tasted like cold lobster in lettuce - but hey, i love lobster so  its all good :)\n\nBlack Cod with Miso - OMG - I just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. It is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. I like how crunchy and  soft it is..  delicioso~\n\nShrimp tempura roll - your basic roll ..  \n\nBento Box dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with Green tea ice cream) YUM YUM YUM YUM - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared with someone special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nWill definitely come back - Loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.\n\n But hey, theyre's always next time!!
0 ||| I would rated minus 5 if i could, stay away from this place specially this person named Kimberly she is awful she chopped my hair off way far from what i've asked to at the end there was no haircut and she told me: \"the less you wash your hair, the better it will look\" i needed it dirty!! I SHOULD'VE CUT MY HAIR AT HOME CAUSE THIS PLACE AIN'T WORTH IT!
2 ||| So my usual suspects & I (Dion L., Katie M., & Simone M.) headed out to Osso on a Saturday night.  I had made reservations via Open Table & was happy in doing so, considering Saturday nights could be busy.\n\nI got there about 6:55 PM & was shocked to see only one table being used by a group of 7 ladies.  However, I was even more shocked to see how small the restaurant is! They do have a small patio out front; however, it faces a small parking lot & other venues. The decor is pretty fancy, but they have no real theme going on. I was a bit confused by what exactly they're going for. I did appreciate the house music mix playing overhead...it wasn't too loud or too soft. \n\nLuckily, they allowed me to go ahead & be seated, while I waited for the girls to show up. I browsed the menu (which I had already done online), which is very limited as far as food offerings.  The drink/wine menu on the other hand, overflowed with options. \n\nMy girls showed up & Dion, Simone ordered martinis (which run anywhere from $10 - $14), while Katie went with a Caipirinha . I went with the upside down pineapple cake martini - which to my expectations, tasted like the cake! \n\nWe decided to order appetizers: blue crab & ricotta crustini, meatballs, & a special appetizer of locally grown cantaloupe & honeydew melon with prosciutto. While we were waiting for our appetizers, one of the waiters picked up a table over his head & hit the chandelier above our table, sending shards of glass on the floor. Luckily we weren't harmed; but decided that we needed new drinks, just in case any glass landed in the glasses.  The manager came over & apologized & gave us new drinks (on the house). Naturally, we were expecting maybe a discount on our bill, but sadly, we didn't get that.\n\nThe appetizers arrived all at once.  I have to say my favorite was the melon & prosciutto plate.  The melons were indeed fresh & tasted sweet. The prosciutto wasn't \"fatty\" & wasn't too salty. I did not try the meatballs, but the girls said they were good. The blue crab & risotto was just OK. I didn't taste anything spectacular with it.\n\nFor my meal, I decided one of the specials: a ghost chili pepperoni pizza. When it arrived, it was almost the size of a medium pizza that you would get at say Pizza Hut or Domino's.  For $11.95, I was happy about the portion. The pizza also had fresh mozzarella, green olives, & red onion slices. The pizza was ok, I've definitely had better. I did eat the majority of it, but three pieces went home with Katie.\n\nOur waitress was very nice & friendly & very knowledgeable about the menu. She came to check on us regularly & between her & other wait staff, our water glasses stayed full. During our time there, the restaurant got packed - which again, isn't saying much, since the space is so small. \n\nFor what it is, the menu is quite overpriced & the food is just OK. After all was said & done, we decided this would be a good spot for \"drinks only\".
4 ||| This review, and the five stars that come with it, is for one thing and one thing only: A cocktail called \"Picoso\".\n\nCoda and I had a light dinner and drinks here on New Years Eve 2010, and I have l been craving this delicious beverage ever since.  Every single sip was a delight. When you drink as much as I do, it's easy to get bored with the usual \"interesting\" cocktails. I mean, how many places are going to carry Pomegranate Margaritas before people STOP getting excited when they see it on a menu?  When I say people, I mean me. I would literally take an IV of Pomegranate Margarita, I love them so much, but they've become so standard, I needed something new.\n\nThis drink they call \"Picoso\" was interesting enough to be actually memorable. The fact that I'm even using the word \"memorable\" in relation to New Years Eve is unheard of, considering I haven't remembered a New Years Eve since 1999. The hint of jalepeno was the perfect compliment to the muddled fruit and tequila.  This drink was enough to cut through my alcohol induced amnesia and take it's rightful place in my memories of fantastic drinks past.  I'm not even mad at the fact that it probably played no small part in me losing track of time and being in the restroom when the clock struck midnight. Oh well, I probably wouldn't have remembered that anyway.
2 ||| Thirty-five minute wait must mean something's tasty here. Good thing they have free coffee outside while you wait. Nice touch.\n\nI liked the atmosphere, like a southern hospitality cottage-type setting. It went well with the friendly service we were given by all of the servers there, since none are assigned to a specific table. They all work together to cater to all guests.\n\nWe came for breakfast, so I wanted the stuffed French toast. Not a fan of pb, so I asked if I could get a Nutella & banana one instead. Wasn't a problem at all. Cool. But then when my food came out, it didn't look like Nutella. It wasn't as dark. I tasted it, and turns out they do a Nutella + cream cheese mix. Disappointment. I tasted more cream cheese than Nutella. Meh.\n\n3 out of 5 at our table ordered the corned beef hash. They picked the right thing. Definitely better than my french toast. Oh well.
3 ||| On a night of drinking and gambling at GVR there was no better place than Village Pub!\n\nBuild Your Own Burger medium-rare, roasted poblano peppers, swiss cheese, Dijon mustard all on a garlic sourdough bread with steak frys make for a hearty meal, I was only able finish half of this 1/2 Lb. Delicious Black Angus Beef burger.\n\nBarkeep was friendly and conversational an over all great place to visit, so much so that I kept on drinking forgetting that I was only there to pick up some grub. \n\nSo was I just drunk? And maybe the place really wasn't that great? NOPE\n\nI came back for a late lunch the next day and once again it was a hit (service and Food) with nice sized steak and eggs with some home frys and a bloody marry to take care of that hangover.\n\nI don't have any thing bad to say about this particular location, so if your in the area and your hungry and or thirsty stop by.
4 ||| I chose this restaurant based on fellow yelp reviewers. My friend missed Mexican food he used to eat in San Diego, so I looked around and trying to find the closest I can find to what he is used to in San Diego.\n\nI liked the decoration inside the restaurant and patio looked very inviting.  Waiter was friendly and took our order right away.  \n\nSalsa was very tasty.  We ended up eating two bowls of them with chips.  We ordered shrimp picante, seafood enchilada, fish tacos. All were good, cannot decided which was my favorite.  For desert, we had fried ice cream (free for a birthday boy), flan, and apple pie on hot skillet.  Everything was so tasty, price was reasonable, great atmosphere, good service.  I will definitely come back again when I want to eat good Mexican food.
4 ||| Way way better than the Apple store. I spent 2 hours at the apple store and they couldn't help me, all they did was wipe phone phone, told me I needed to buy a new one.  Since I am from Canada I wouldn't buy one here.  I went to  Mac Media and in 20 minutes they had my original phone back to normal!!!  Great shop, saved me money and quick.
2 ||| I go to this restaurant usually on Sunday morning because they have their awesome double stamp days. \n\nNow for the restaurant-The wait can be a little annoying especially on the weekends. But, that's expected. \n\nThe atmosphere-I usually  go to the one in Chandler off of Ray Rd. The atmosphere is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. I like the little breakfast bar they have. \n\nFood-The food is delicious and they have the perfect portions for me. However, my husband often complains that they don't give him enough food. But, this is where the cool little $1 menu comes in. They have a wide  range of things that you can add to your meal for $1. I usually add the fruit cup or mini-pancakes. I haven't had a chance to try a lot of their menu items. They have a pretty long list of items and I often get overwhelmed trying to figure out what to order. I have had the 7 Veggie Omelette. It was very tasty! What made it more enjoyable was knowing that I was eating a healthy omelette. Some of them have tons of ingredients and even one with all meat. The one thing that I have tried that I DO NOT recommend is the biscuits and gravy. I have had better. The gravy can taste a little bland and the biscuits taste chewy on the inside. \n\nServices-The service can be hit or miss. But, I do like that they give a large cup of your beverage to go. \n\nGreat place overall.
1 ||| For a change of scenery or you simply are sick of all-you-can-eat buffets, I would suggest this place. Just know that, like all other Asian restaurants, you are going to get terrible terrible service. The staff will act like they are doing you a favor by feeding you. The food at other Sam Woo's restaurants in Southern California is much better.
4 ||| Yippee I found the best girls in North Phoenix.  Definitely stop in and see Ann, Tracy or Victoria for your holiday nails.
0 ||| Out of crepes at 310pm on a Saturday.  Ordered a red bean taro delight. \nNothing delightful of taro bits in this awful drink.\nOverrated!\nDon't waste your time or money!
2 ||| The crepes here were a bit odd.  I didn't like the texture or the taste of the batter. My friend and I split a breakfast crepe.  We got the sausage and egg crepe.  It was definitely a good size to fill you up.  The crepe wasn't horrible just a bit off than what I would normally taste from other crepe places.  The dough was just really off and threw the rest if the taste off.  I wouldn't come back unless they changed their crepe batter.
1 ||| I ordered the T-bone and eggs. The food wasn't the best, especially hash browns and toast. The hash browns were extremely bland and a little burnt. Speaking of burnt, the toast was. One side was charred while the other was slightly burnt. As for the T-bone, i asked for medium and got well-cooked. It was dry but A1 sauce helped a little. The only safe thing was the eggs. But a little later I got a stomach ache. Although I wasn't happy  I gave a 2 star because I've had worse.
1 ||| I dropped my car off with a flat. they said 10-20 minutes. I said please call me when it's done I need to go to work... Three hours later NO PHONE CALL. I go to the location to find my car up on the lift. They said you need new tires... OK I get new tires. wash my car a couple days later and find my custom chrome valve caps are missing (they put plastic caps on two tires and LEFT TWO TIRES WITHOUT CAPS). So I HAD TO GO BACK to the location only to have the manager tell me they don't have them in the shop, and would have to order them (NO VALVE CAPS IN A TIRE SHOP?!). So now I have to make yet ANOTHER TRIP back to the location. I will not be going back to this location.
1 ||| Bouchon is one my favorite places to go when I am in Vegas,\nMy last trip in March was marked with a scar. I left a comment on their website and have not heard back so I decided to post here as well.\nIf you have been there you would know that the food is good and prices are on the expensive side. So what stunned me when I got my bill is the charge of their house water for $7 a carafe. ($21 for 3). Seriously! You are charging me for tap water at a place where we pay more than regular prices for food. Shame on you for trying to rip off your customers. And btw I didn't ask for any special water, I said tap water when I was asked what do I want to drink. \nThe good news is that they adjusted the price but that was embarrassing in front of my business guests.
3 ||| We found Sprouts shortly after moving to town.  There's a nice selection of Groceries & Vitamins.  It's like a cheaper, smaller version of Whole Foods.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g28b-5cvHgB-p8j59f370g?select=stCJ1HuorzNtxmprpezaAA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g28b-5cvHgB-p8j59f370g?select=J2rTcyvakIwIEEnGCdsRKw\n\nWe shop here at least once a week.  I like their selection of Peppers....I like my spicy food!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g28b-5cvHgB-p8j59f370g?select=19-XvIaBGHuFpKGeKwX2eA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g28b-5cvHgB-p8j59f370g?select=b3VNnU-JuRGEOt1J5y7Xcw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g28b-5cvHgB-p8j59f370g?select=dRAhEu9LmoD2qHAqLYWleA\n\nTheir freshly made Pizza isn't too bad either.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g28b-5cvHgB-p8j59f370g?select=HBBENkGPWZeccT92sHsvvw\n\nOverall, it's a nice shopping experience for all of us.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
4 ||| Thee most exciting thing happening in Pittsburgh right now is the Techshop! Mark my words kids, this is next level shiz! \n\nWhat is the TechShop you say? Well, I had no clue! But when I took a tour of the place I could hardly even listen because I was so excited about it. You can come here and make things! And you don't even need to know how to make things, you can learn! \n\nFrom sewing to glass etching, printing to woodworking and way beyond, you can make! So if you're someone who already knows how to make these things, you can purchase a membership and stop in to make your project. \n\nDon't know how to make a metal flower? Me either! But I will once I take their class on how to make one! All classes range in price, but if you get on their mailing list, they seem to send out discounts frequently.\n\nIf the space wasn't cool enough, you can also use this as a work space if you're remote! They have a cafe with free popcorn, I mean, what more could you need in your workday!
4 ||| I had a really good meal at the bar here on a recent trip to the Valley of the Sun.  I've eaten at the Del Frisco's in Charlotte many times and was aware of the Grille concept the chain was rolling out but this was my first chance to frequent one of the Grille's.\n\nThis location is an easy walk, just down the street, from the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton.  The main restaurant was packed but the bar was a perfect place for a lone dude on the prowl (JUST KIDDING HONEY!) so I took a seat.  I was promptly greeted even though the bar was pretty crowded and within a minute had a drink and a menu in my hand.\n\nI ordered the Wedge salad and just like at a regular Del Frisco's, it was drenched in that oh so damn good blue cheese dressing and had crumbled up pieces of their awesome bacon on top.  For the main event I got the Prime Double Cheeseburger and I can truly say it was one of the better burgers I've ever eaten.  Two juicy, flavorful patties, American cheese, some kind of delicious mayonnaise based sauce, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles.  A great balance of savory, fatty, acid, soft, crunchy, etc, etc... \n\nAll in all, this visit left me longing for a version of the chain here in the QC.  Del Frisco's quality food at a cheaper price point.  That's a lot to like!  And, if you do want a big ole prime steak, you can still go that direction.  What a country!
2 ||| If it were only about the sushi, Nobu would get 5 stars from me. But, I knock off 2 stars for service. We walked in on a Saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. We went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were Nobu's house specialties, including \"new-style sashimi.\" These consist of the best fish, sashimi style, with delicate sauces and garnishes: yellowtail with jalapeno, live octopus with a Peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon with ponzu sauce, tuna with miso-mustard sauce. Everything was first-class, including the Junmai Daiginjo sake.\n\nThen, I ordered the bento box chocolate cake dessert. We were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. No problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. Another ten minutes went by. Our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. He tried to give us a plateful of mochi ice cream to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful of mochi ice cream and then a chocolate cake. Another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. It was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. We ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? By this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nWhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. When I mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. But I was miffed that I even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\nToo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. Even for a Saturday night in Vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.
1 ||| The Fringe, the International Festival, and the Film Festival, I can all understand.\n\nThe Book Festival, that's pushing it a bit.\n\nThe Politics Festival, that really is just taking the piss.\n\nIt's not that politics is particularly boring or unimportant, it can be quite fascinating and is integral to almost any major event in history, but it's just not the kind of thing that requires a festival. Try as I might, I can't see a crowd of stinking hippies sitting round in a circle, sniffing glue and discussing the merits of the capital gains tax.\n\nNext up, the Festival of Accountancy.
4 ||| One word of advice: PINEAPPLE AGUA FRESCA w/TEQUILA\n\nWe came in Saturday around 7:15pm.  We loved the decor and friendly laid back vibe.  The restaurant has a really nice patio with comfy booths.  Glad they seated our party of two in a spacious spot!!\n\nThe salsa and Chips are really yummy and we got a salad and 3 tacos that were delicious.  The cucumber salad on the side was refreshing to counter the subtle spicy flavors in the tacos.  Of course the fish taco is amazing and the carne asada is pretty classic. Next time we go I want to try the guacamole and grilled corn appetizers.\n\nThe main thing I enjoyed was delicious pineapple agua fresca with tequila!!! My sweetie was responsible and barely tried his 1 margarita... I drank most of it because I truly love lime and sour (versus sweet) margaritas. We are just starting in on the refreshing cocktails they offer- I spied over 5 agua frescas that you can customize with alcohol and they offer which agua frescas go best with which liquors.\n\nToo bad we didn't get dessert though I'm confident joyride is an addition to our regular date night spots.  I'm a big fan of any Arizona attempt for quality Mexican inspired food!!
4 ||| I had an emergency and these good folks were wonderful. They stayed after-hours to treat me. The staff couldn't have been more wonderful and Dr. Scott Manthai gave me great care and follow-up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
4 ||| Went for lunch on a Living Social deal.  WOW!  We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!
3 ||| Small and cozy diner atmosphere. Good friendly customer service. Burgers and fries are really good. I will be visiting this place often to get my hamburger fix!
4 ||| BEST BEST BEST BUFFET I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo many selections! Everything is hot and fresh... and ohhhh so tasty! This is not the best buffet in Vegas! It's the best anywhere... and I am the queen of everything all-you-can-eat! If you're looking for a good buffet this should be the only place you consider!\n\n****Beer & wine is included in the price. If you're into ciders they have their own special berry cider that is to die for!!!****
3 ||| Please note that I have not dealt with Dr. Crovetti. My review is regarding Dr. Bahlduini and his nurse. One comment about Dr. Crovetti's front desk staf - they could truly take some classes in customer service because in person and on the phone they have been a bit short, and seemingly irritated, put out that I wanted to talk to Bahlduini's nurse (she insisted I call back so I didn't get the attitude). I have become increasingly sensitive to those in the customer service who have these jobs but act like its such a chore to provide the core service of their job... but I digress.\nDr. Bahlduini was referred to me from St. Rose (St. Martin Campus) and is an orthopedist. My knee injury was of concern to the ER doctor when she found out I had an avulsion fracture (where the ligament tore a chunk out of my tibia when it tore loose). The doctor is very knowledgeable and he has several athletes that he sees to (this is of interest to me because  I ride dirtbikes and motorcycles and this knee thing seems pretty scarey as far as what I will be able to do going forward after surgery).\nHis nurse is very nice, and has done everything she could to expedite the process of getting MRI approval from my insurance and getting me scheduled for everything necessary on a very tight timeline (I leave the state/country in a little over a week). If anything changes as far as the service I receive from these two awesome people, I will be sure and update the review. Otherwise I couldn't be more pleased with the speediness of service I have received.
4 ||| I love this place. They are always friendly, the cheese curds are the best as well as the chicken tenders.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.
1 ||| I went in with hopes that I would be blown away. Most of the crap I have done is at Del Web out in Sun City West. So I was excited that I would be having a procedure here and that I would be spoiled from everything I read and was told. \n\nMy medical records were lost, I tried to warn the nurse that my veins roll and aren't happy with needles, she didn't care - until it happened to her. Then she wanted to hear all about what I had to say about which arm works better and why. A random nurse walked around telling everyone she was lost and didn't know where she was. Which again, 20 minutes before I am to go into Surgery was the LAST thing I wanted on my mind!! My medical record was eventually found - in recovery - however I was still I pre-op. they all laughed it off, I freaked out! One of the doctors on my team made it a point to tell everyone she had never worked with my surgeon before and she had no idea who she was looking for. I could go on and on. Why am I writing all of this? Because as a patient I shouldn't have had to hear ANY of this. I was more stressed going in, hoping the right procedure was being done with the right doctors than anything leading up to my surgery. \n\nThe plus side. Private rooms, food delivered around the clock, and the volunteers that gave us a mini tour when I checked in. Otherwise, I'll stick to Del Web from here on out. \n\nAs for my doctors, I'll review them separate.
4 ||| This place is amazing! Location is easy to get to and valet is Perfect! It's free and I didn't mind paying a few bucks for the convenience! The food is great! Came here for a brunch with some girlfriends on a Saturday morning! They were willing to give us a nice comfy couch area for our group of 6-7. We all got mimosas and our server offered to just grab us a bottle since it would be the same price ($5/each). Yum! I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again. I hear they have deals on Monday and Tuesday nights for wine and bruschetta!
4 ||| Quality great service fast and creative! I liked the purple rice and generous portions. Spicy cucumber salad was fantastic and not too crowded,
0 ||| It was the only Chinese take out around the Rhodes Ranch area for awhile. To be honest, the food is average and a bit pricey in comparison to other establishments.\n\nOn the positive, their honey walnut shrimp is very tasty and I recommend it.  \n\nMy only real complaint, which is a pretty big deal is that they have awful customer service.  Phone orders are always rushed and they dont reiterate your order so you dont know if they got it right. Also, they're not very welcoming at all. When you go in, they appear to just care about taking your money and rarely thank you. I always feel cheated or wrong about giving them business. The Hawaiian place door always shows their gratitude and China A No No should learn from them. I would not recommend. Try Pumi, instead.
0 ||| still sucks! Enough said.
4 ||| Great service and great prices if you have one of the fuel programs they accept and they will waive handling fees with purchase.
0 ||| Eeek! You can feel the testosterone in the air at Caesar's. Look someone the wrong way and you've got a flying fist coming straight for you face. \n\nThe music lacks variety and they play the music waaaay to loud! Maybe I'm just too old for this.
3 ||| Great condo unit....really worth the time spent here...
0 ||| Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home.
2 ||| I'm a local, so I suppose I'm a little partial for neighborhood businesses, but Pittsburgh Fish & Chicken is certainly a great option if you live in Brighton Heights or you're just passing through after work with a hankering for fried.  You're mainly going to find all things fried, with the exception of a few individually packaged desserts and waffles (which accompany the Chicken & Waffles dinner special), but fried is what they do well here - with a mildly spicy, lemony dusting of their signature spice blend.  Avoid the fries (unfortunately they are not fresh-cut) and the sandwich version of any of their fried offerings (the buns and accoutrements are second rate).  Yes, the place is a little shabby looking, but the cooks are friendly enough, and lord knows we need more local business, and dinning options in particular, in our proud neighborhood.  Try the ocean perch, catfish, or the chicken tenders, which are surprisingly awesome, even for an adult palate.  The best bet is to order ahead and have your fried feast waiting for you.
3 ||| the arizona burger gets the extra star here- it's wonderfully spicy. other than that, it seems like big specialty burgers that are good but not great
2 ||| Montreal is a great foodie town, and it has its staples.  French/Quebecois cuisine.  Bagels.  Destination restaurants like Joe Beef.  'Montreal smoked meat' is definitely on that list, though maybe not the first one that an out-of-towner like myself thinks of.  Once you get past that part and hear that this is a must-have, chances are Schwartz's will be the main place you hear about.\n\nSchwartz's and the locals know that this place is popular.  The day before we visited while buying bagels at St-Viateur (another name you'll surely hear being held in high regard), the other patrons were raving about the length of the \"lineups\" in front of Schwartz's.  Schwartz's also realizes this, and in turn operates both a sit-down and carry-out side of their business, a major plus for moving the crowds through quickly.\n\nThe beef itself...pretty good.  If you're familiar with the corned beef, this has similar consistency, utilizing the same brine-curing process, but is actually kosher-style beef brisket.  Throw a bit of mustard on that and put it between 2 slices of bread, and that's all you need!  The amount of hype may have knocked it down a star, but if you go, you won't be disappointed.  Just remember to grab napkins on your way out...this is by no means the tidiest sandwich you'll ever eat.
4 ||| Wonderful place to eat dinner in Vegas!!!  We had a delightful dinner here with live music in the background.  We had to wait to get seated but totally worth it!  Very enjoyable meal.
1 ||| Stayed for a conference; extended trip for personal vacation.  When checking in, last night of stay was quoted $9.99; when returned home, learned that I was charged $179.  Managements excuse was \"someone mis-entered your rate when making the reservation, we reserve the right to increase your rate to correct the error.\")  I was expecting no more than $139/night, so was shocked to pay that much to stay at this hotel!  There are better hotels on the strip for that amount (or lower), so in retrospect I would have switched hotels had I known the true rate!\nThe pros:  smaller hotel, so easy to navigate the casino/lobby, good cocktail service on the gaming floor, centrally located.\nThe cons:  long check-in, check-out lines, billing errors not resolved to my satisfaction, rude customer service at the management level.
0 ||| This place is a $hit shack.  We had some coupons and went there on SuperBowl Sunday.  2 chickens and a bunch of sides cost us $40.  It just wasn't worth it.  Plus there is nowhere to park.  If the 5 spots are filled out front, you're screwed due to the poor design and layout of this store, to its parking lot.\n\nSave yourself the trouble.   Go to Costco, Albertsons or Frys and buy one of their pre-made chickens for $5. Shoot...buy 3 of them.   Buy your own sides (Kraft Mac-n-cheese, Bushes baked beans, instant mashed potatoes) and make them yourself.  \n\nFeel better you didn't give $40 to this crappy establishment.
2 ||| Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \n\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.
1 ||| Ok, I do not see what all the hoopla is about.  The burger was better than fast food but inferior to Smash or Five Guys.  I was not impressed at all. Went during a normal lunch hour and service was average. Not bad, just normal.\n\nAgain, not a fan of this place, hard to understand what the deal is with this one.
0 ||| The groomers there werent very nice to my dog, hes very sweet and well behaved. When I got my cat groomed she still had loose hairs all over her. However, there hours are great! 8 am-8 pm. It cost about $65 bucks to bathe and groom my cat. More money for my dogs.
0 ||| Got the veggie burger, which was probably 98% salt. Not. Good.\n\nThe boyfriend liked the wings, though, and there were lots of TVs. If I go back, it will be for a beer, not for the food.
3 ||| We stayed here for a couple of nights.  Since it was the middle of the week, we had a sweet deal.  Thankfully we were in a floor that was fairly quiet, as well as being well off from the elevators.  The room was nice and clean, albeit starting to show a little wear and tear.  Staff was really nice and our kids loved swimming in nearly all of the pools.  Would definitely stay here again.  It was a really nice way to start off our vacation.
3 ||| On our recent trip to Vegas I researched different restaurants to try - turns out that Dos Caminos AND Isla have closed. We knew we'd be in the Cosmo for the Secret Pizza (that's another review) and I wanted to try China Poblano after reading the menu on the Cosmo website. What I DIDN'T do is check the Yelp! reviews, and I'm glad I didn't. What we experienced was so far different from most reviews that I've just read!\nOK look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. And the \"salt air margarita\" (I just HAD to try one) was worth every cent!  I have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven. \nThe wait staff were friendly and efficient. The manager, I\u00f1igo, even stopped by to chat with K'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo. It came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. Adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharr\u00f3n topping. I had a fish taco which was fantastic, and K'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!). \nThe drinks were what really got me excited. After the \"salt air margarita\" I had another specialty called a \"Mexican gin and tonic.\" It's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and I don't know what else, but it worked. For dessert I had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!  I wish I had a bottle of their sangrita for sipping tequila here at home!\nAnyway, it's a week later and we're still talking about our experience. We loved the decor, the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. We'll be back!
1 ||| The concept is amazing, and I probably set my hopes too high for this little joint. Watching a movie and enjoying full service food and drink at the push of a button? What's not to love?\n\nTurns out, just about everything. The execution was totally off. We were the only people in the theater but somehow the service still sucked. The food was mediocre. The second run movies were mediocre, but plenty entertaining after a couple glasses of wine, which were offered at a decent price.\n\nI guess it's the cheap bastard gene in me that has a problem with this place. I nearly bust a nut when I have to pay full price at a regular theater and shell out for their snacks, let alone drop double the amount on a crappier second run version of the same theater fare. \n\nI'll stick to catching the drive-in double feature with my own bottle o' wine and snacks, rather than return to this place and shell out obscene amounts of money on freezer-burned puff pastry and vino.
4 ||| I love this place. I used to go to 99 Ranch Supermarket but stumbled upon this place. The aisles are more wider so i don't have to worry about bumping into other carts. It's not as crazy and jam packed as 99 Ranch and the staff is definitely more nicer and helpful too. I love coming here for Asian products. I even bought my first shabu pot and gas grill along with all the goodies to eat with it. They have everything you can imagine for Asian cooking.
1 ||| I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches.
0 ||| Went totally out of my way to purchase my supplies for school because my teacher told us to,  they are way over priced I so returned them and bought them at Top Notch Art Supply down on S Craig St. Just a few blocks off campus. Can't understand why our teacher pushes this place, it's like shopping in a cave, prices are high, it's over 2 miles from campus and all the staff is crabby, with sour puss looks.
4 ||| One of the finest dining experiences
0 ||| This place is so close to my new home and I was so excited to try it out so my daughter and I stopped by for lunch a few weeks ago.   I must say it was very large, clean and had a very nice atmosphere.   The place was empty so we were seated right away.  The waitress came right away to take our order and seem knowledgable about the menu.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, we were asked if we wanted it fried or grilled?  I asked the waitress about it and she suggested the grilled calamari.  As an entree I ordered the baked ziti and my daughter ordered the penne quatro formaggio. \n\n Our appetizer arrived shorty, it was not what I expected, it was at best mediocre in taste and very spicy. My daughter was not able to eat any of it so I made the best of it.   Our entrees arrived soon after, the food looked pretty good.  I tried my pasta and the taste was 7 out of 10.  However, the garlic bread that was served with my meal was very greasy.   My daughter's pasta had a very nice flavor but it was covered with an inch of oil.  She tried to stir the pasta but more oil was accumulating, it was disgusting.  I called the waitress over and showed her the oily pasta and asked her to bring my daughter something else.   A cook? who was standing nearby looked over to see what was going on and she explained to him that \" it happened again\".  \"Again?\" I asked, no one answer, she took the pasta and came back later with the menu and asked my daughter to choose something else.  She picked the tortellini.  \n\n10 minutes later, her pasta arrived, my food was cold and we finally got an explanation to what happened to the pasta, sort of!  It seems that during the cooking process the cheese \"broke\" whatever that means.\n\nThe tortellini was extremely mediocre, we've had store bought ones that tasted much better and cost far less.  They did not even offer to reheat my meal after I waited for my daughter's and to top it all off, we were charged for the entire meal.\n\nNeedless to say that I am never ever coming back to this place.  Their management has a lot to learn about good customer service and obviously their kitchen staff needs to learn how to cook as well.
2 ||| Finally made it out to Great Wall for dim sum. I've been hearing so much about this place but I am hardly ever in this area so it was sitting in my \"to try\" list for quite some time. Walking in, I thought, this is gonna be legit. The place was packed to the rim with asian people waiting to get their dim sum on. The decor and vibe reminded me a lot of dim sum restaurants in LA's chinatown circa 1990's (ABC seafood to be exact). \n\nWe didn't have to wait long before we were seated. We tried their sui mai, shrimp rice noodle, deep fried shrimp and chives wrapped in bean curd, and honestly I forgot the rest because it was all nothing memorable and I usually have a great memory. The chives and shrimp bean curd roll was probably my favorite of the bunch but I'm a sucker for any dumpling, cake, roll with chives :) It was something I haven't seen at other dim sum restaurants before so I enjoyed that.\n\nIn summary, it was okay. It satisfied my dim sum craving but... would I come back? Probably not. I live in Chandler and I find my two go-to dim sum spots there (Phoenix Palace & China King) much tastier. && I only have to drive 5 minutes to get there. Actually, if I lived near Great Wall, I'd probably make the drive to Phoenix Palace. Yep.. I think it's that much better!
1 ||| Yikes. This seemed like a good idea in theory. The end product was tasty - pizza toppings of your choice in a cone. But the kids operating the cash register and making the cones were pretty lax about food handling - from the register to serving the cones to filling the ice in the coke machine - all accomplished without once donning gloves or hand washing. I had a hard time NOT thinking about all of the times they touched my cone. But I are it anyway. Won't return.
1 ||| UGH. i went here after tryst, and my oh my was it a disappointment.\n\nthe moment i stepped in, i felt the sexual hostility and tension in the air.  like i was stepping into a den of LIONS or something. \n\nit was so packed, sweaty, sticky, dirty, and NOT-FUN.  i got surrounded by a group of guys from Israel and they freakin made a circle around me so i couldn't escape.  by the time they let me go MY BELT WAS MISSING!!!! how the HELL DID THAT HAPPEN!?!??!? i felt so VIOLATED afterwards. \n\nso i went to the servers and bouncers and asked them to look for my belt, and 15 minutes later they appeared with it.... SOAKED in stale beer, water, and other weird smelly fluids! EW!! EEEEEWWW!!! \n\nthe crowd is really college-y where people are just OUT TO GET TRASHED and PLASTERED and want to VOMIT THROUGH THE NIGHT. but if you're into that kind of stuff, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! :]
0 ||| This place needs better management, better food quality and better service.  \n\nWhen we walked in there was no one at the hostess station.  After about 5 minutes, and being ignored by the waitress who walked by us twice, we asked the bartender who said we could sit anywhere.  At that point, we should have sat ourselves at another restaurant!  The place was not very clean; we sat at a booth right next to the bar (pretty visible, right?)  Well, it took another 5 minutes to get a menu.  We were not given any water, I ordered a coke which tasted flat. \n\nI ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was fatty and tough. My friend ordered a hamburger which she said was ok.  Our waitress ignored us the entire time we were there except to take our order.  We couldn't even get her attention to give us the check. Maybe she wasn't motivated to deliver it b/c she wasn't expecting much of a tip.\nRightfully so!\n\nThe bathroom smelled as bad as it looked.  Paper on the floor, unflushed toilets....\n\nThat should be enough info to spoil your appetite and steer you away from this dive.
2 ||| This should really be more of a 3.5, but I'm not in the mood to round up. IMPLEMENT HALF STAR RATINGS, YELP!!!!!\n\nAs Scott said, this place is really shabby looking on the outside. It also has really poor hours. They're labeled as closing at 3, but often I've seen them closed at 1 or 2pm. I've kind of wanted to try this place for a couple months, but have never found them open when I want breakfast type food. \n\nAs with any breakfast place, I order the Chicken Fried Steak. CFS is how I gauge a restaurant's breakfast. Screw it up, and I'll never return. This place was pretty average for it. The meat was ok, but it was a really really thin cut of meat. The CFS they serve at Blueberry Hill is much better, in my opinion. The potato chip/slice style side was really good. The eggs were a bit rubbery, though they did do a good job of the over-easy aspect of it. (gotta have my yolk to dip toast in)\n\nWe had a sundae afterward. Sadly, the ice cream (even though they have a little ice cream parlor in the place) was a bit freezer burned. For some reason, their chocolate syrup tasted heavily of vanilla. Not really sure what's going on there.\n\nThe service was nice, but a few times, my friend and I were waiting for refills or service in general. The check was dropped after we ate the breakfast portion, and we weren't asked if we wanted anything else. It's not like it was busy either.\n\nAll in all, I might return, but I really prefer Blueberry Hill.
0 ||| I cosigned my car with these guys and they failed me miserably. Not only did they sell my car for about half of what it was worth but their customer service was horrid. These guys do not care about anything except making their outrageous fees and commissions. They will say anything to get you to cosign without a reserve but don't do it! Once you sign you can kiss your ass and your car good bye. Any of the other auction houses will treat you much better and let you protect yourself with a reasonable reserve.
0 ||| I think this is not a new buffet in town!! I just went there on Thanksgiving day, which is not the first Thanksgiving day. OMG I have to wait for 5 hours to be seated. Unprofessional management, there are a lot of table empty but no one clean it, so there are only 70% can provide to customers. 30% left unattended. \n\nThey charge for $10.- extra for Thanksgiving but no sign posted. \n\nThere have only 2 staffs working for almost 500 customers. Those 2 staffs served only their \"DIAMOND\" guest. The rest, just keep waiting, they don't care!!! \n\nWhen I complain to one of their staff, she complain to manager, who standing and do nothing, I just got bluffs back that he will kick me out from the hotel!!! WTF \n\nHe treated his staff better than his customers.\n\nThe food is great!! but I lost my appertise already.
1 ||| I have been a loyal Pei Wei fan since 2007 and have dined at their locations across the country. This location is BY FAR the worst in terms of speed of service and being on top of their game. I moved to Las Vegas back in October and this Pei Wei is very near my home. I like to order online and pick up my order on my way home. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt the first few times, but I am about fed up with this location. I'm wondering if their parent company's recent financial woes and restructuring have affected all of their stores. I did notice that they've done away with the plastic cups used for dine-in beverages and have gone exclusively to disposable paper cups.\n\nMy main \"beef\" with them is the fact that today I placed my online order at 5:33 and received a confirmation that my order would be ready by 5:55. My order is normally ready at other locations WELL before the promised-by time, however this location's sloppy staff just doesn't get it.\n\nToday I received my order at 6:05, more than 30 minutes after placing my order. Some might say I am being way too picky, but it is all about pleasing the customer, and this location falls short of this consistently. The staff is ever changing (including management), so I'm not sure what the story is here.\n\nThe food quality is still good, however I noticed today I had no condiment bag with my order that usually contains sauces and fortune cookies. It looks like Pei Wei is cutting back, and that is not what I would expect from this chain.\n\nI hope corporate will take a look at this fledgeling location.
3 ||| the kale salad is the bomb!
2 ||| Well, it is a regular mall with regular stores, however it was my first time in a Clinique store, since when did they have their own store?! Only in Vegas, I suppose. \nIt has a nice facade, big silver and round button-like decor, very shiny, very Vegas-Hollywood, after all, it is next to Planet Hollywood Hotel.\nOverall 3.5 stars since I found what I was looking for, to heal my chapped lips. \n\nFYI Saw the billboard that H&M opened their doors in this mall last Thurs, Oct 4.
2 ||| This is a good pizza place, but not up to all the hype. If you want a great pie, then take a trip to LA and visit Monzza.  Monzza makes the best pizza in all the land.
1 ||| First off, I realize that this is a school and with this knowledge I thought I would try it out. \n\nThe waiting room is a sad sad sight. I knew that the low price would bring in some questionable elements from the diversity of our society, but not this weird of a selection. Many old people.\n\nI came on a Saturday shortly after 8, thinking I was on the ball.. but I wasn't. I had almost an hour wait, but I was prepared to wait so that is all on me. One female looking confident and professional came out with a smile and said a name. Not my name. It's a shame because she had everything I was looking for in a massage therapist. \n\nShortly thereafter a woman comes out, and meekly states my name. I immediately get a bad feeling but I shake it off. I am here as an evaluator and just trying to see what this place have to offer. I ask her how long she has been doing this and she says she is halfway through the program. She asks me if there are any areas I want her to focus on and I say it would be great if she could focus on shoulders and the base of my skull. Nothing odd there right?\n\nAfter this comes close to an hour of really awkward pushing and poking. It was clear that my therapist didn't know what she was doing, and didn't have the confidence of doing it. She spends just as much time massaging, as she was correcting the sheets, towels and other stuff OCD style. It was really bad.\n \nAnother thing worth mentioning, she gave me possibly the best massage of my pectorals I have ever got... but then again spent almost no time on my shoulders, and didn't touch my neck, skull, shoulder blades or anything else that actually needed some attention. (Funny that she asked initially, but maybe that was just a box to check?!)\n\nConclusion: I realize that it must be hit and miss regarding what therapist you get, and therefore what experience you might have. In my case it was a miss. I will give this place one more chance.
1 ||| The last several times we've had Grimaldi's we haven't been overly impressed with the pizza quality, lack of toppings, and the cost to value ratio just plain sucks. Last night we ordered 2 large 2 topping pizzas curb side for a measly $42.\n\nAfter getting both pizzas home and opening the boxes we were presented with 2 pizzas that barely had enough mushrooms to even qualify as having them as a topping. Maybe if you combined the mushrooms from both of them you could've actually had enough for one. There was a decent amount of onions so no complaints there.\n\nMy wife and I can wolf down one of their pizzas with ease if that gives you any idea as to how filling they are, they aren't. The taste is good, the employees have always been friendly but the value is not there and in these times cost to value ratio matters a lot more than it used to.
2 ||| This office has several people in it including doctors and at least one physician's assistant.  My mother-in-law's coverage includes this office, and it's reasonably close to home, so this is where we come.  Thus far we've found the staff to be friendly and professional.  No complaints.  And they aren't in a hurry to leave the exam room, staying to answer all questions.  The tests they order are reasonable for the complaints of the patient, and they seem thorough in evaluating the results.\n\nOverall it seems to be a solid medical practice.  We will continue coming here for the foreseeable future.
3 ||| Very nice place.  Good atmosphere.  We were stuck at ADEd across the street for a conference and lunch was \"on you own\".  Saw this on YELP and gave it a try.  Nice place, great view and good food.  It's a cafeteria, do not expect \"Nobou\".  For what it is, it's very nice.
2 ||| So I went back to this place to try something off the rest of the menu.  My husband and I both ordered the pho with well done beef.  While I was impressed with the freshness of the sprouts, the soup left a bit to be desired.  The beef was really fatty and the noodles were really over cooked.  I know asian places are not known for their customer service but when I ordered a drink with a number instead of the name, the waitress about crapped herself.  She yelled in shock as if I was trying to order two entrees.  At least the gentlemen who work there were friendly.
4 ||| Our first \"attack\" straight off the airplane was a trip to Le Village Buffet as recommended by Christine T.  We arrived in Vegas close to 9AM.  We dropped off our bags at Ballys and proceeded to Paris.  Line was short since it was around 10 when we got there.   I LOVE breakfast, it is my favorite meal of the day!!!\n\nFor some reason, these chefs knew exactly what my favorites are, as if they were cooking for me!!!  LOL! Bacon - nice and crispy, exactly the way I like em, hashbrowns and red potatoes with herbs and stuff - I just have to get them both.  Eggs, scrambled all fluffy!  I could list more, but EVERYTHING was delicious. I mean EVERYTHING, even the COFFEE was brewed perfect! Not too strong or too weak (for me, sometimes the coffee can make or break the breakfast place).. \n\nWhat put me over the top was the made to order crepes!  I ordered a crepe with banana and nutella with drizzled with chocolate syrup. Thinking about it makes me salivate. ha ha\n\nI love the decor of the little town!  I think it is so cute!! Our waitress was very attentive. She knew exactly when to check up on us.\n\nI know there are TONS of buffets in Vegas, but I will have to come back to this one.\n\np.s. dont forget to try the bread and brie (I heard it's the BEST) but I forgot at the time (so I'm writing this now so I won't forget next time).  :)
1 ||| We ordered the shellfish tower, steak, lobster bisque, and lobster mac. (Yes, we love lobster). Bananas Foster for dessert.\n\nThe soup was cold so we had to send it back. After it was warmed up, it was absolutely fantastic!!!\n\nWe ordered the steak encrusted with bleu cheese. It didn't come with bleu cheese so we needed to get it on the side.\n\nThe shellfish tower was way overpriced for the quantity of what you actually get. Way overpriced.\n\nThe lobster mac was great. However, this $13.00 side came in a tiny little bowl. It was way too small.\n\nBananas Foster was mouth watering. Delicious!\n\nThe customer service was wonderful.\n\nMy overall impression is that this place is just simply overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you receive. Your money is better spent somewhere else.
3 ||| The park is probably better known for its 6.5 miles of single track mountain biking trails.  It has a little something for all skill levels, but it's very rooty.
0 ||| I did not like this ice cream. I had a few bites - threw it away. Didn't have the flavor/texture of the real deal. It looked like ice cream, had all the proper attributes of ice cream... but it wasn't. Maybe its an Asian take on what we know as ice cream? Me no likey.
1 ||| This is a brand-new Walmart that was built right next to the old one. They are currently tearing down the old one and, if I remember right, are going to use that space as parking lot. I hope that is correct, especially after my visit today. \n\nI saw three separate vehicles (one on the way in and two on the way out) waiting for somebody to back up and open a spot. No big deal, right? Except that both cars sat and waited for a few minutes. I thought the first car was disabled because it sat there so long. \n\nThe store itself is fine. It's a Super Walmart, so it has the grocery store side. It's a lot like the one in Monona, but without the fun underground parking (best thing I've ever seen in a Walmart) and escalator. I tried to check out using the self-checkout because it is faster when I only have ten items or so. Well, this self-checkout machine was troublesome. It kept telling me I had unauthorized items in bagging area (uh, it was the item I'd just slid over the laser) and then it said I had a restricted item and needed cashier approval to finish up and pay. I didn't have any alcohol, bullets, weapons, or cigarettes. I had a 2-pack of lighters, which was probably it, but why? At any rate, the guy monitoring the self-checkout had to come over and help me three different times. This was in no way faster than just going through a regular register. \n\nThe cashier who helped me to checkout and a guy I asked about Nutella were both nice, but it was an overall frustrating experience. Having the last part be the worst part didn't help.
0 ||| How many people will get fooled coming here thinking it's great Asian food? The duck was OK. It's just not worth it.  Took 2 hours to get our regular order. Other tables got up and left. Our party of 10 stayed and roughed it out. When the food finally came it was cold and we were too tired to enjoy it. So they write a few Chinese words on the ceiling and throw in some asian looking statues. Ok looks like a Chinese restaurant now. Lol. To sum it up the food sucked and the service sucker. We went to the club and it was packed. They didn't count how many just let everyone in. I think the fire Marshalls came. Am I a complainer? No! This whole facility is poorly managed. Who is the GM and where were they 1.1.2015? Fire them asap. BTW. Who serves duck with Tortillas?? Its supposed to be with Steam buns. You don't see Asians in here which means it's an expensive version of PF Changs at most. You don't see Asians at Panda Express either.  Hint hint  I dont mind spending $1000.00 for food but it better be a decent experience.  So now they can take some of that money to put into marketing and lure in more suckers. Save your money and TIME because this place will take them both from you.
3 ||| Le Palais des congr\u00e8s, accessible directement \u00e0 partir de la station de m\u00e9tro Place d'armes, est un excellent centre de congr\u00e8s. Premi\u00e8rement, les \u00e9crans r\u00e9partis sur toute sa surface expliquent clairement aux participants d'un congr\u00e8s ou d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement donn\u00e9 o\u00f9 (et quand) ils doivent se diriger. \u00c9galement, entre les pr\u00e9sentations ou assembl\u00e9es, on a l'embarras du choix pour se restaurer. On trouve notamment dans le complexe un Tim Hortons, un Subway, un d\u00e9panneur Couche Tard, et m\u00eame une excellente table, le Fourque Fourchette, o\u00f9 on propose toutes les bi\u00e8res d'Unibroue en f\u00fbt. Bref, c'est un endroit pratique et toujours propre, au centre ville de Montr\u00e9al, o\u00f9 il fait bon de participer \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement.
0 ||| Terrible, we've stayed at other MGM resorts and they were all better (regardless of price) than this one.
4 ||| No reviews for Love Carpet yet? \n\nI have had them out to my house twice this year and have been satisfied both times. \n\nThey are always on time and sometimes even early, but never late! \n\nThey do the job quickly and efficiently. My gross super old carpet looks pretty dang good when they leave. \n\nThe tech was courteous and not creepy in the least.
4 ||| We did a two night \"staycation\" here. It's very close to my work, so my commute was cut down to almost nothing, making for a very relaxing stay.\n\nFor a hotel of this class...very nice. Breakfast was terrific, healthy options, even whole grain batter for the waffle maker. Fruit toppings for waffles were a nice touch. Great selection of food here. Our room was nice, roomy, comfortable, well-appointed. \n\nStaff were very friendly, the front desk had folks waiting at prime check in time. May have to do it again next week!!!
3 ||| The food would be 3 stars but the service made it 4 stars.   Our cute waitress Tashja made the meal.  Super friendly and personable, but best of all she knew the menu and made great suggestions.  \n\nThe North Boulevard drink was Yummmm...pretty dangerous because you couldn't taste the alcohol but could tell more than one would get you pretty messed up.  Like happy lemonade.  Fried Pickles were great, super crunchy.  \n\nI had the Ahi Tuna burger...yes, I went to a burger joint for tuna.  It was very good.  \n\nHubby had Turkey burger which he thought tasted a little weird.  Just eh.\n\nSandwiches are definitely not very big as others have said.
3 ||| Aaron you have awesome customer service skills and also to the brunette bar tender!  You guys are awesome although the nacho's was a feat that crushed my confidence because of the large portion i will be sure to bring backup next time. Made a few friends too gregg and mariam from cali and mark from nm! Hope you see this hit this place up with a good review!
2 ||| This garage is hit or miss.\n\nCompletely depends on what is going on (events etc...) Pricing is usually fair but I have left several time feeling taken advantage of. ie. special event flats rates when you are not there for said event.\n\nOtherwise I usually feel safe leaving my car here, kept pretty clean, and within walking distance to just about anything. I'll be back!
2 ||| This location is okay. It's always super busy, but the staff is usually really nice and efficient, whether you're there during busy lunch hours or stopping in for a random bite while in the area shopping. There's really nothing to complain about...except that it's a greasy fast food joint, with greasy salt-laden food that makes me happy while I'm eating it, and immediately feel blah about 5 minutes later. Regardless, if I'm willing to put up with feeling awful after eating, this is one of the better Chick-Fil-A's to eat at.\n\nAlso, the new chocolate chip cookies at Chick-Fil-A are absurdly delicious. Seriously. Fast food places have no right making such delicious treats. Haha.
1 ||| Overrated..\n\nAtmosphere: Too many seats so they can pack as many people in to make the most $ in the least amount of time. It's not comfortable and it's not cool to eat elbow-to-elbow with strangers, especially when one person is coughing continuously and it's so hot in the room you know it's a hotbed of colds and flu waiting to happen. It's a condo decor-as-restaurant-themed location that's so over and tired; but if the diners are impressed, who cares, because they don't know any better.\n\nFood: For lunch, quiche (too many rosemary sprigs), and pulled pork sandwich (cinnamon, cumin, and clove?) and leek soup with hard pieces of stalk.\n\nService: When the server removed our plates that were more than 2/3 full, there was no question about whether we liked our dishes. \n\nThere are better places in the neighbourhood by far.
4 ||| Stopped in for lunch had the maza plate,stuffed eggplant and beef kabob everything was very fresh and delicious We will definitely  be back
1 ||| Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no Chinese or Italian food. My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs.
4 ||| This is my favorite Starbucks. I work in the same complex so I'm here on a daily basis. They are so good to me and always make sure I'm well taken care of. My favorite drinks always taste so much better here! The staff is excellent. The only time I ever had to wait long for a drink, they apologized for it by giving me a free drink coupon. Apology accepted and incident forgotten! I love this place!
4 ||| I have used completely clean for several years for my cars and company trucks and they are fabulous always on time and will work on meeting me were my trucks or cars  are even at last minute to get them cleaned Thank you
1 ||| This new concept of fast soup and salad service just doesn't make it for me.  I like the original Sweet Tomatoes full service soup and salad bar on Stephanie but this one just doesn't satisy.  I stopped in to get a quickie lunch and it was.  You have your choice of 6 soups and a salad that is custom made by the servers as you walk the line.  I got an 8 oz. cup of their delicious chicken noodle soup (including chunks of chicken) and simple salad.  The price with tax came to just over $11.00.\nNo value here.  You can go to the soup and salad bar on Stephanie and for $8.99 get all the soup you can eat, all the salad you can eat (you make your own there), several different types of other salads such as macaroni, broccoli, cole slaw, etc., baked potatoes, pasta bar including mac and cheese, pizza, muffins and several desserts.That is an all you can eat buffet so the concept is what I'm used to at S.T.\nI didn't feel I got my money's worth at the Express.  Why didn't they put a full sized Sweet Tomatoes on this side of town?   We all agree we would have preferred that. With so many places to eat surrounding this one I can't imagine spending $11.00 for soup and salad.  Make no mistake, the  quality and freshness are still evident here; I just don't get the Express thing.\n\nYou can eat in - there are several booths inside, take it home or take it out on their  patio. The drawback is that the patio is located right on Eastern with all of the traffic and gas fumes along with the noise.  Not cool. \nI live right up the road but won't go back.   I WILL continue to go to the original S.T. on Stephanie.
0 ||| Extremly Dissapointed, I came to this place thinking it was truly the best place in Vegas but its not even close to Good. Don't Waist your Money.
4 ||| Aghhhh I love ICE CREAM\n\nSo this place is right across the street from my apartment. I came here in high hopes not to be disappointed and sure enough I wasn't. My dads family is from Michoacan so I know what the ice cream should taste like. This place has exactly that. The ice cream is creamy and full of flavors. They make their own ice cream which is a plus.\n\nThis place also has fresh made flavored waters. For example horchata, mango, limon, melon, and etc. Plus they have Botanas aka Mexican snacks. \n\nThey will put what ever you want on you ice cream I always get the nuez ice cream with coconut and chocolate.\nThey also have outside seating where you can just watch the the cars and people outside.
3 ||| I love this lounge/bar. It's a unique place in Vegas - it has a view to die for, the music is excellent and you can actually carry a conversation with minimal \"what did you say's\". Most bars in Vegas are too dark (ie:Caramel), but Ghostbar was perfect. The crowd is fun and its a large enough of a place to.....errr.....hide and its a small enough of place to locate any lost friends. I make sure to make this place a \"must go to\" venue in Las Vegas
0 ||| Never again! This place is gross. Dirty stained sheets, windows that don't open, bathrooms with no locks! \n\nStayed here for 4 days.. housekeeping NEVER ONCE CAME. Why don't you care?! :(\n\n\nOh, they give AAA discounts but you need to tell them before you book..
2 ||| I only get the carmel flan...they hit the spot but I've had better...for the $2 price, you can't go wrong with that.
4 ||| Called these folks after my drivers side window was smashed in by a thief. The staff was understanding and sympathetic to the situation. They went out of their way to ensure that I got the best service. The tech was on time, and completed the task efficiently, most importantly he had the right tools, he had my car door carefully disassembled, then vacuumed the door, mats and cleared all the broken glass from the window channels. 45 min later the new window was in and I was back on the road in no time... thanks Secure Auto Glass and thank you Ash..
0 ||| Horrible customer service! Malissa the manager would rather have a 2min + conversation about counting her daily calories then acknowledge a customer or even properly cash out a guest.
0 ||| Called for an appointment and to make sure that they received my vision insurance plan as the plan website recommend this place. \nA totally rude lady picks the phone and after I ask about the plan and is obvious that my question is making her life difficult,  she puts me on hold for about 3 minutes comes back tell me that they don't take the insurance. When I explained that their website recommends them puts me on hold again for 5 minutes and again picks the phone ask me if I want to make an appointing without an insurance completely rude and without any concern of customer care. I told her that I was just going to check with my plan  and she hung up the phone on me. There are so many other stores like this in the area but was the closes home but in definitely going somewhere else.
0 ||| As an old SRS dirt track racer I was glad to see that they became a hobbytown. I was looking forward to the bigger inventory. Now that my son is old enough and is getting into drift cars I was looking forward enjoying this hobby with him. After our first couple trips to the store I guess we are stuck buying everything online. I like supporting local businesses, especially ones I've spent a lot of time with in the past.. The customer service was HORRIBLE, they didn't want to spend anytime with us. We are new to  drift cars and need someone with knowledge to set us in the right direction. It seemed like we were a BIG inconvenience to them. I will only go back for screws and nuts..
1 ||| Picked up a car was fine but I reserved a car to return at different station. All information I received was wrong, I called call center and they gave me wrong info. The number they gave me was useless because takes forever to get LIVE person.
2 ||| My friend found this small Moroccan grocery and invited me to stop by for dinner. The interior consists of a grocery and clothing section, and a tiny dining area. There was not much of ambiance as we were the only visitors on that evening. It's a one-person operation and the owner does everything from kitchen to the floor. \n\nThe Harira ($3.99) came with lentils, tomatoes, garbanzo beans and cilantro soup. The blend of ingredients and spices made it zesty hearty with a good lift stemming from a mix of lentil and cilantro. It was a light opener and one item to consider for those looking for soups. \n\nThe Baba Ghannouge ($4.99) came with baked eggplant, sesame sauce, garlic, and lemon. The thick eggplant consistency was garlicky and addictive. The zesty lemony flavor nicely intertwined with the deepening sesame sauce. However, the bursts of eggplant flavors were held in check and in need to be more striking.\n\nThe Bamiah ($12.99) was put together with a large bulky piece of simmered lamb, saffron, okra, and a combination of spices. The okra was very tasty and nicely stewed. The outer-layer of the lamb had some dry spots, but otherwise it was tender and easy to fork into. The mix of spices could also be more intense and integrated. It was missing one note that could have brought it all together. \n\nThe Goat Tagine ($14.99) was culminated by a large bulky piece of goat with the bone in, saffron, and spices. The goat too, had some dry spots on the outside, but it was still very tender and easy to fork into. The aroma was sensational, but I wished the goat were seasoned better.\n\nOverall, the food was solid but not spectacular. There were some minor wow factors stemming from the soup and the wonder aroma of meat and spices. Despite the missing notes that could serve as a bridge between the meat and broth, but the drizzles were still very tasty when served on top of our generous servings of rice. \n\nService was very personable and friendly. It goes without saying, but the one-person operation will cause the food to take some time to arrive. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their good-looking Bastilla.
0 ||| Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no
2 ||| I have had their food, it is OK, not the greatest for the price you pay.\n\nThe ice cream is great! It's very creamy...I love the turtle, but the only thing I don't like about it is that they change the flavors every day and you never know what the flavor will be, that is annoying to me!\n\nWhen I like something, I stick to the same thing every time. This means that I will ONLY go there once a month for the ice cream that \"I\" like!! The other problem with that is that I always forget when that will be, so that leaves me only going there about 2-3 times per YEAR!!! Which sucks because I DO LOVE that flavor!!
1 ||| Nothing special. I've had better chicken, fried okra was not crispy, corn bread ok I guess, Waffle House waffles are better. But the fried chicken gizzards were excellent.
3 ||| Great fresh mex! Love the salmon tacos with a mango salsa. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from Tia Rosas!\n\nThis is a well established restaurant in the valley and has been loved by the locals for years. Always fresh and good.
0 ||| Well, it's a Starbucks...  Same coffee, same general atmosphere, but that is all that's good about this location.  It is about a third the size it needs to be, there is ALWAYS a waiting line and tables are overcrowded and sometimes hard to find.  Forget meeting with any privacy at all.  I felt like I was in the middle of three other conversations!\n\nI DO NOT recommend this location!
1 ||| There pizza is average. The customer service us sub-par and if you enjoy ranch or any extras bring your piggy bank.
0 ||| Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch.
0 ||| This place is straight up ghetto! Parking is horrible, cracks and bumps everywhere. Homeless people on the corners asking for money. Stores are smelly and cold and dirty and old and creepy looking. This is not even close to a mall. Nearly half empty. \n\nLove the bahn mi shop inside (the best sandwiches ever!) Love the fresh steamed pork buns and other baked goods!),..love the varity and prices of products..worth the drive out there...\n\nPho restaurants are nasty,..as in the decor (covered in thick thick dust), ceilings have stains, dark and just make me loose my appetite. How can this place be opened? Imagine the kitchen..inspectors need to shut this strip down and remodel and update!!! \n\nThe store that sells kitchen ware has good selection and prices. Shop owners and workers are shady...they follow you around and stalk and stare you down as you in walk and browse around the aisles to make sure you don't steal anything!
2 ||| I hope you're not here for anything other than nostalgia.\n\n\"One Orange Julius, please.\"  Bam...that does the trick!\n\nWhat's not to love about an Orange Julius?  What's to love about hot dogs from a roller grill?
3 ||| I had a craving for Mexican food tonight... which happens rarely enough that I should I should indulge. I had no idea where to get good Mexican food in Champaign, but a quick Yelp search brought up Fiesta Cafe, which is conveniently located just a few blocks from my apartment, and also stays open everyday until 12am (an oddity in Champaign where a lot of restaurants are closed by 10pm). \n\nSo I decided to check it out: I didn't actually eat there, only got food to go, but the restaurant seems pleasant enough that I will probably go back soon. I ordered the chicken mole, and it turned out to be quite good... in fact, surprisingly good and quite better than most Mexican food I had while I was in NYC. It's also very reasonably priced, and the service was very friendly. Nice place!
2 ||| A few friends and I were craving Sushi while visiting Madison; a friend suggested Edos. \n\nUpon arrival I was impressed by the interior design of Edo. The restaurant had a very modern Japanese layout. Being a Chicago native where Sushi is easily accessible, I expected more from Edos considering this is one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. \n\nThe Food:\n\nRolls were priced fairly. 6-9 dollars per roll which contained 6-8 pieces; average price for most dine in sushi \n\nMy order consisted of crunchy salmon roll and a Manhattan Roll. The Manhattan Roll is spicy salmon on the inside topped off with a slice of tuna. The Tuna was thawed and tasted very mushy, almost to the point where it tasted not even fresh. \n\nThe crunchy salmon roll consisted of spicy salmon on the inside, but after eating a few pieces I realized there was little to no salmon and even went to the extent of taking the roll apart to see what was inside; I was right, there was little to no salmon.\n\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Our waiter was great, and the restaurant was very clean. The food quality is what ended Edo's with 3 stars. Food quality can be much better considering this is a Japanese Restaurant and one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. \n\nI will possibly be giving Edo's one more try the next time I visit Madison.
3 ||| Great place to get that hard to find spice type of stuff.
4 ||| This is by far my favorite place to stay at because every room is a suite! The rooms are so spacious and have THREE, that's right, THREE televisions, one of which is in the bathroom. My favorite thing about the room is the bathroom: his and hers sinks, vanity, tub, stand up shower, toilet in its own room, and of course the TV. The first time I ever stayed here the bathroom practically became my hang out spot. \n\nThe Venetian also has a great location. It's near the fashion show mall! You can cross over to the Palazzo and take the bridge to the mall. There is a Walgreen's connected to the Palazzo for your convenience as well. I suppose the Palazzo has the better location but I love both of these places just the same. \n\nMy suggestion: go to their website and sign up for email promos. You can get rooms for as low as $109. Also, don't be afraid to join the players club. You can get free rooms or mad deals on rooms. \n\nOne more thing then I'll shut up. There are awesome restaurants all over the damn place here. You really never even have to leave your hotel. Everything is at your disposal.
1 ||| The store near Bell and 7th St. was filthy.\nThe employee making the pizza obviously had a cold or sniffles or something.  Repeatedly touched his face and handled the food.\n\nMy slice of pizza was very good.\nBut the utensils were all soiled, the tables were dirty, windows dirty, etc.\n\nBeen to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times.
2 ||| The food was really good. The service was terrible. The waitress was acting like she didn't want to be there. The least a server can do is refill your glass once you have drank all the water and have eaten all the ice. She still got her 20% tip because of gratuity.
1 ||| When I first saw their hours of operation I thought it was a mistake and they meant to write p.m., instead of a.m., but now that I have eaten there twice it makes more sense. When nothing else is open, and you're wasted, I'm sure this place ROCKS!
1 ||| We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.
0 ||| Golden Nugget deserves 1 star when you have to pull a couch cushion off of the sofa to put in the bathroom to get some peace and quiet sleep.  I'm not proud of it and it's a first for me, but sleeping in the bathroom was about the only place I could get some rest.  Had the front desk only informed me that the music and noise coming from Fremont Street Experience was so loud that it penetrates the walls of the Rush Tower hotel rooms facing it, I would have elected to go on the opposite side of the tower.  I was here on business, not by choice, and got the short end of the stick.  People staying here be warned: if you are in the new Rush Tower facing  Fremont Street, the music plays full volume until 3:00am and literally penetrates the windows and walls.  Putting your hand against either of them will reveal the pulsating beats and low-end frequencies of the music being blasted from 100 feet away.  I'm not being elderly about it- I'm in my 30's and enjoy loud concerts....just not when I'm trying to sleep.  \n\nI was compensated 1 night free for my troubles (stayed a total of 2 nights).  I'll say that the rooms in the new Rush Tower are nice and hold their own against any of the newer 3 star hotels on the Vegas Strip.  But what good is a nice room if you can't enjoy it?\n\nCustomer service was the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel.  When I called at midnight willing to change my room for another, nobody at the hotel was willing to help.  I complained that I was never given a notice about how much noise would be pushing through the wall and it was only met with a mere \"well, this is Vegas and the city never sleeps\" attitude.  I call B.S..  I've stayed in most of the major hotels lining the strip and have never had an issue with outside noise.  The next day the manager on duty, Orion, told me and my group of 20 business administrators that \"he would not\" allow us to speak to the General Manager, Brett, because he did not want to bother the GM with an issue like this.  I really can't believe that the words out of his mouth were \"I will not do that for you.\"  Nice customer service.  He said that in front of a large group of us at the front desk.  This is what we in the business world say should be a \"never event.\"  As in, me and my group of 20 administrators will never be back to the Golden Nugget based on the poor customer service.  I hope Brett puts a check on the attitudes of the managers because it makes the hotel experience awful and reflects poorly on the hotel management.  \n\nMy 2nd night they conveniently found me a room facing the opposite way as Fremont Street.  At night it was peaceful, quiet, and the way it should be.  \n\nThanks for comping me one night, though. It was my company's money and at least Orion admitted that my guest experience was not acceptable.  I told him to pass on to Brett that the Golden Nugget should start giving a disclaimer to all guests to warn them about the excessive noise that comes through the wall.  He said that it was \"a great idea\" and I'm sure that he was lying.  I bet he never brought it up again.  The fact is that the Golden Nugget is just not a guest friendly hotel at this time.  Maybe a change in staff attitude would help put the bow on an otherwise pretty package.
0 ||| I wasn't even in the restaurant for a full 10 minutes before I was denied service because my cousin went to use the restroom when we entered. Apparently you can't use the restroom here folks without the manager accusing you of being too drunk when in fact she wasn't even drinking. The manager had a major condescending attitude. FYI it wasn't even busy yesterday and they denied service to some very generous travelers. I didn't even know what to say. Awful.
2 ||| I'll echo Julia S' sentiments and note right upfront that I wanted to *love* this place. Adore. Because, frankly, I LOVE their bright orange food truck. The actual restaurant fell just a bit short of a fabulous lunch. \n\nThe restaurant inside is a bit vanilla. I was expecting a little more pizzazz from the local front. The walls are plain besides the photos of (assuming here) local produce & farms. Table cloths, silverware etc. is standard and fits into the hotel restaurant box. The service was prompt and efficient and I really have to no complaints here. Everything was delivered in a timely manner and he validated my parking, too! \n\nAnd now to the food. I ordered the prosciutto and ricotta panini. Meh. It was fiiiiine. And if you have a spouse and she says something is fiiiiiine, it's usually meh. Or she's pissed at you, whatever. The sandwich was exactly what it described but it was boring. No spice, no joie de vivre, no looooove. The fries, on the other hand, were delightful. Hot, fresh and crispy - they certainly cut them in house. Even ask Tonya P - the fry queen - she enjoyed them. \n\nI know I'll come back because I really love their food cart and I want to love this place. The local, farm to fork concept is true here and that definitely stands for something. I'll be back Harvest Moon Grille and I hope my next meal is delicious.
4 ||| I absolutely love this place. I have been twice and Katie (bar manager) has been my server both times...she is great! She recommended the bacon/Squash flatbread and it was outstanding! The wine was great, and even greater on HH (which, btw their HH is from open to 6pm M-S. They are not open before 3pm though, so don't try going here for lunch...it's a chill, nighttime place to bring dates or close friends/family members.\n\nOn weekends, there is always an acoustic musician playing. I have experienced Blaine Long and Notes from Neptune. Both phenomenal. \n\nLong story short...if you read my reviews you know I like chill spots with great lighting and patios. This is another one of those....I will be back for a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc time.\n\n:)
3 ||| Party of 4, on a Wednesday night, first timers, all food was very good. The carpaccio and the crab cakes were a great way to start this start this meal, the beef tartare main was also delicious.  The Petit Pot de caramel was so very good, it wasn't shared at all!  Attentive service and bilingual.  C\u00f4t\u00e9 Maison seemed quieter than the main dinning area, which was a good thing. One small disappointment: the washroom, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Maison.
2 ||| What about writing a review about a gas station? Probably not the most useful review that I can do, but well, I went to this station on my last day of vacation, I guess that writing a review about it makes me feel kinda nostalgic!\n\nAnyway, this gas station is located less than one mile from the Airport, so I guess that prices are probably higher but it's nothing compared to what the rental car company would charge if the car is not returned with a full tank! So that was ok. Also the staff was friendly.\n\nOh, and after reading previous reviews I double checked my credit card statement to see if they overcharged me. They didn't. And then I remembered that I paid cash...
2 ||| Burger was good. Sweet potatoes fries were burned and cold. Cookies were also cold despite website saying they would be warm. Service was courteous and okay for the most part. Food could be improved.
0 ||| Here is my update: I just received this incredible message from the \"counter-helper girl\".... After all this time, she sends this. Bitter much? \n\nGofuck Y.\nBlock User\n\nOne minute ago\n\"I am said 'counter helper girl' in one of your postings.  I was not trying to be snide or snotty, but simply help you with ordering for your next visit because I know how our food comes, always loaded with sauce.  But thank goodness, you most likely won't be returning.  And since you know so much about food and restaurants, I would think you'd know that the hour you came in at, is generally the slow part of the day in ANY RESTAURANT YOU VISIT.  I actually really do apologize that I came off snotty and snide, and that I was not prompt with your order, but you could have just been sincerely upfront and honest about your meal and I would have given you a free meal or two.  Instead of acting like a pretentious jerk to me while your fat girlfriend with fake hair threw daggers at me with her eyes and spending so much time blasting me on the internet.  And I'm sorry, how on earth could a 'counter helper girl' be at all pretentious by any means...  You were just rude, and it was unnecessary.\" \n\nLet's address, shall we? This email shows that you're a nasty, bitter, insecure bitch. Check. We most likely WILL be returning, but only to show your boss, and the owners this lovely email. Check. You have no idea how much I know about food & restaurants, because you don't know me, but run some quick math. I'm 35. I started working in the restaurant industry at 14. That's 21 years. Probably longer than you've been alive, girly. \n\nBeen sincerely upfront? When? While you were talking shit with your co-worker? Right. I'll get right on it. \n\nNeed I even address the \"fat\" comment? She's 6 feet tall and an athlete. Sorry she doesn't look in the mirror in disgust and need to go vomit herself into a positive self-image. Fake hair? Jealous much? It's real. As are her tits. That you need to talk about her physical looks to make a point about your shitty service reflects much about the way that you see yourself. Let me guess; you think you're fat, and hate what you see when you look in the mirror. She does not. Check.\n\nAs far as those little daggers that you felt... It's because you suck at doing your job. You're there to work, not socialize with your besties. I watched as my food sat in the window for minutes with nobody paying any attention to it, to the tune of me needing to physically get up out of my seat to bring it to your attention. THAT is unacceptable service. It's shocking to us that there could literally be 3-5 people in the restaurant and food still sat in the window for a prolonged period of time. Again, unsat and unacceptable. Serving food that you admittedly say is loaded with sauce is \"your thing\", but to remake it exactly the same way shows a lack of attention to the customer.  \n\nEnjoy your job while you still have it, and I'll be seeing you soon. Check and checkmate.\n\n**I want to offer my sincere THANK YOU for validating everything that I stated in my review of you, and the restaurant.**
1 ||| Maybe because it's a new location they have not got the kinks worked out yet.  We sat in the bar area.  The server took almost 30 mins to come back to take our order after we told him we wanted to order food.  We shared the general Li's dish and asked them to split it.  They just brought  an extra plate.  That's okay, but actually placing the meal on two separate plates would have been a nice extra step and a lot less messy for us.  They were a little stingy with the rice, too.  Not really enough for the rest of the ingredients to balance out the soy sauce, so it turned out too salty.  Tip: ask for extra rice.
4 ||| Oh, YUM YUM YUM!  I couldn't decide between a few flavors and settled on vanilla mint and loved it.  I need to go back and have the peach.  \nI was stuffed so couldn't order more than a small... there's always next time!
2 ||| The Office Max in South Scottsdale get's the job done. They have a good selection of office products.
4 ||| Perfect.  The best $200 I have ever spent on an aromatherapy massage. Done by a world class therapist named, Jodi!  The decor is like being in a plush, extravagant dream.  I love you, Encore spa.
4 ||| I love this smoke shop so much!!!! Everyone there is always so inviting and nice, and very knowledgeable!! It's a nice play to hang out and kill a few hours!! They have great prices on all their items in the store!! I totally recommend people to shop here, you won't regret it at all
4 ||| First \"Vape\" Store in southwest.  About time!  Prices are cheap and competitive!  Good selection of products - They keep adding more every time I go there.  \n\nAwesome selection of e-juice flavors!  Staff is very friendly and informative!
2 ||| Well my boyfriend & I decided to have breakfast yesterday at Babystacks. I had been there before when they first opened, back when they were called Babycakes. It was a Thursday, mid-morning, and we were greeted right away by a woman who sat us. She was very nice. I ordered the \"homemade\" corn beef hash & eggs & I got the red velvet pancakes. The red velvet pancakes are divine. If you like red velvet, you'll love these. I've had lots of RV pancakes & these are by far the best. The corn beef has looked like a cube of dog food. I've had corn beef hash a lot & this wasn't that great, neither were the eggs which were a strange color. The hash browns were undercooked & bland. My boyfriend got the Mexican skillet which also looked underwhelming & wasn't that great, according to him & he is an authentic Mexican. Haha. The portions were small & it was expensive. The reason I'm giving it 3 out of five stars is for their pancakes, which they're famous for, and our excellent service. Our server (I wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shoutout) was amazing. She was happy, friendly, and very attentive. The service from everyone I saw was amazing. I'll go back again for sure.
0 ||| We waited in line for about an hour (we got there around 11pm) and we were on the guest list, so there was a separate line. Girls got in for free while the guys had to pay $30. Walking in, it immediately reminded me of the clubs in LA! I would rather go to TAO, Marquee or XS and pay instead of this place. Why go 250 miles to club at a place like in LA?
2 ||| Good service, nice patio atmosphere, generous portions, excellent drinks. I would recommend the fish tacos and the house margarita, but skip the ceviche.
4 ||| Had the pleasure of checking out this place yesterday. It's a small little family run place tucked in the corner of a small strip mall. When you walk in you are greeted by the 2 owners who run the place and seem to do all the cooking. They know what they're doing.\n\nWe ordered the b&g special sandwich which is baked chicken, roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, and pesto. Awesome flavor. I'm craving it right now just thinking about it.\n\nWe also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for my little guy. It's was his first time having pizza and he loved it. I loved it as well because I got the leftovers.\n\nMy wife ordered a \"personal\" pizza. It was more than enough for 1 person. She added artichokes, broccoli, and eggplant. The eggplant was strips of fried deliciousness. I'm a carnivore but I loved it. The wife was very impressed.\n\nAll in all this place is great. Non-assuming family run place with amazing food. The pizza is as good as any pizza I have ever had. Can't wait to go back!
0 ||| Do not!! \nI repeat, do not even think about spending money or time in this sorry excuse of a \"Vegas buffet\",  it's pathetic, really sorry I ever walked in..\n\nThe food sucks really bad, the service is nothing to write home about, but the food!!! It trully blows!  There are very few things I regret in life, and trying to eat some of this dry and flavorless crap is on the list of regrets, this  junk made me feel like a total shmuck.. A nobody.. \n\nI really enjoy good food, it's what I live for, but this place made me feel depressed.. \nThe waffles taste like an old shoe, the pancakes taste like they were made with recycled cardboard batter, the sausages taste like they have been under the heat for a few days, etc etc...\n\nYou know what, I really have nothing nice to say about this place..\nIf you bothered coming to Vegas, make sure it's worth it!\nGo to the buffet at Rio, or you can also try the buffet at the Area, it's really good!\n\nSo unless you lost your taste buds in a horrific accident, stay away from this dump!!!!!!!!!  You have been warned..
3 ||| MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.\n\nThis is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos. \n\nThey have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.\n\nThe portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.\n\nThe tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.\n\nThe California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.\n\nThe restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.\n\nAnd if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)\n\nPS I think they are closed on Sundays
3 ||| Quaint set up.  ALMOST reminds me of HOT (my personal fave).  Menu items look good and there's a good variety.\nNewspaper on hand to read which I really like.  Courtyard/patio dining, with misters, option.  Very limited seating indoors.\nI had the pulled pork and it was fantastic.\nI will be back.
1 ||| The food is overpriced for what they give you- one chicken breast and a spear of broccoli was $22.50. Talk about making a come up!! Not to mention it wasn't seasoned very well.  \n\nThe interior of the restaurant looks very dated. \n\nThe only positive was that we were pressed for time and our waiter was able to accommodate. \n\nNot worth it. I would rather wait for a table next door at Meat and Potatoes than return here even if they are the only place with open tables which was the case tonight.
2 ||| The place is beatiful, the food was ok, nothing spectacular...  The service was SLOW!!!!!  we all got rather irritated over how long it took to get our food, and we all ordered the same thing, the steak and lobster, we must have waited almost 30 min... \n\nI doubt i will be returning.
3 ||| This is a new fav happy hour place for us, we've already been here twice this week. It's pretty close to our house, great happy hour and great service, both times we've been there, our servers were really cool. Oh, and the food is pretty good too, especially for being so inexpensive. \n\nCan't beat $2.50 margaritas, they aren't the biggest margaritas, but...$2.50, I'm not going to complain. I had a steak taco last night, it was pretty dang good, and they have a salsa bar. My fiance loved his burrito.\n\nThere is also a nice little patio.
0 ||| Seriously?!?  You really don't want me to spend my money here... Ok...  the most od aweful service I have ever received in a retail store in my life.   They literally turned a few hundred dollars worth of sales I was about to make out the door.  I will NEVER go back here again.
1 ||| Mediocre at best....\nStopped by on Saturday for a lunch. They had no grilled chicken available! I know... things happen but when place call itself Peru Chicken and has no chicken available it's like hot dog stand with no hot dogs.\n\nOrdered something called Tacu Tacu and plate of Antichuchos and potatoes with cheese sauce for app.\n\nTacu tacu consisted of huge pile of rice/beans mixture and small slab of grilled meat.  No veggies, no pickle... just that. Come on - work on presentation and quantities and you can probably charge $10 for that otherwise it's a fail.\n\nAntichuchos - slices of meat on a stick with bland side of corn and undercooked potatoes.  Meat was OK. Sides weren't. \n\nAppetizer (I think it was called pappas a la huancaina) - 3 sad pieces of cold boiled  potato served on a styrofoam plate covered with cheesy sauce (cold as well) - $5 is way too much for it.
1 ||| The Excalibur Rountable buffet reminded me of one of those horrible cafeteria type restaurants. My review is based on breakfast. Luckily we had a 2 for 1 coupon so it only cost my partner and I $9 each.\n\nI don't really know what to say here except they had all your standard breakfast fare but it was all dried out or soggy. It was not fresh at all. I ddin't even bother to go back and get more food. There was a dessert area that had pastries and donuts. Meh.\n\nThe highlight was the waiter who managed to make us laugh.\n\nin response to a comment I read down below, yes the food is mass produced but that doesn't mean it can't be great food. There are many other buffets that actually get it right. Try one of those and stay far away from this place.
4 ||| So delish! Every doughnut I have had has been absolutely amazing! My favorite is the chocolate glaze or the cinnamon cake
4 ||| This was one of the coolest things I have ever done in Vegas. I have been going to Vegas at least once a year since I was about 7 years old. So I remember many of these signs. It was so neat to see them all in one place and that this exists. The tour guide was great. She really knew her stuff and gave you a lot of information on all the signs. The tour takes about 1 hour and was really fascinating. She had great stories about the people behind the signs and I learned a lot! When you get sick o the food and smoke and slots, head down to the museum and get a little history! \n\nThey are restoring smaller signs and putting them back in the community for everyone to enjoy. I thought this was great. There are day and night tours but it was way cooler at night! There are restrooms and a small gift shop with some great books on Vegas. They have really old signs and newer signs like Treasure Island's old pirate sign. So even if you haven't been going to Vegas as long as I have, you will see some signs you might recognize.
2 ||| I went here for breakfast daily when I was on vacation because of the reasonable prices so that I was able to do some damage at the steakhouses at night!\n\nDon't forget to get your patronage card stamped because after a certain amount I think you get a free one.\n\nThe service was good and the food was Ok but its really hard to mess up breakfast.
1 ||| I wasn't impressed by the food here at all. All the other restaurants were busy since it was a Friday night. This restaurant didn't have a wait and I wanted to try this place out since I've never ate here before. I ordered the Thai shrimp & scallops and I was very disappointed. It sounded good on the menu, but didn't taste as good as I thought it would. The scallops were undercooked and there wasn't enough curry sauce. The portion was small too and the price for this dish was $27. Definitely not worth that price. The drink I had was the pineapple paradisio which tasted way better than the food! They gave me a complimentary dessert which was the pineapple creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was actually in a real pineapple for my birthday which was delicious since I love creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but I'm not going to this restaurant for food again.
3 ||| We've been by this place a number of times since we live right by it and we finally decided to try it.  The family was starving and I was in the mood to try something new.  I ordered some chicken and beef tacos, chicken and beef tostadas, a cheese quesadilla, some chips/salsa, and flan to go.  It didn't take too long for the order.  It was probably in the 5-10 minute range.  \n\nI took it all home and placed it on the table for everyone to dig in.  We pulled out the tacos and tostadas.  The meat was great!  Everyone agreed that the tacos were better than the tostadas.  The tostadas seemed to be a little on the crispy side.  The kids tore through the quesadilla so I'm assuming it was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were very good.  \n\nThey also give you a salsa bar to select different kinds of salsa which is very nice.  We sampled the different salsas and found them all to be very tasty.  \n\nWe all finished and it was time for dessert...the flan.  Wait, all the bags were open...where was the flan???  Well $&%@!!!!  They didn't give us the flan but they were nice enough to charge us for it.  I have to admit it was one of the pictures I saw here on yelp and it looked so good.  I was really looking forward to trying it.  I thought about going back and the kids wanted me to go back but it was late on a Monday night and I just wasn't feeling like going to argue for flan.  \n\nI've been debating between giving this place a 3 or a 4.  I really liked the meat but I'm really pissed about the flan.  I finally decided to go ahead and give it a 4.  I did like the flavor of the meat and I will probably return for more tacos.  If you get takeout I would highly suggest giving your bag a couple of extra checks to make sure you aren't missing any items or you risk getting home and being disappointed.
2 ||| Went there on Friday for menudo but it tasted horrible.  It usually tastes good on the weekend, so not sure if I got an old batch or what.   I am going to try again on the weekend and hopefully it will taste better.
2 ||| Neat little local bookstore!  Signage at front counter shows they've been voted Best in LV fairly consistently, nearly every year in the 2000s!\n\nThough I didn't find any books I felt compelled to purchase, there was a 25% off hardbacks sale going on, and the distinct sections of the store were clearly labelled and organized. \n\nBonus star for having a furnished area in the back available for reservation for club or group meetings or events! Seems like a lot of local organizations meet here or at least have occasional events here. Great community feeling!
4 ||| I had never heard of them but the kids thought that the name was funny/inviting. We are greeted promptly and asked if it was our first time. They explained the ordering system quickly. Our 'wiches were made to order promptly and they were delicious. Later I googled them and found that they are a new chain and are opening stores all over. They are worth a try!!
0 ||| Oh God, coming here was a waste of time, money, and caloric intake. I wasn't nearly drunk enough to warrant the food. They have cheap late night specials, but I think I'd rather haul my ass to Ellis Island for their food!\n\nService was SOOOOO slow.\n\nNot only was service terrible, the food was even worse. We ordered several things. My boyfriend's dad ordered a soup from the Chinese menu. This dish was bearable. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs from the breakfast menu. It came with hash browns, biscuit, and toast. The country fried steak was TERRIBLE. It felt like the batter was made of eggs and flour and the meat was tough as well. I ordered the eggs poached, but they were completely overcooked. The worst poached eggs I've had, worse than those cooked in bulk at breakfast buffets. I ended up eating mostly biscuit and toast with jam and butter. The gravy itself was really good. The only highlight of the meal.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the nachos. They were horrible. I don't even know what to say... He also ordered the steak meal and ordered it medium rare, as usual. The meat came back closer to a well done. It was terrible. \n\nOverall, I wish I could turn back time and just eat at the Big Sur Oyster Bar next door.
0 ||| More of a joke than their bait-and-switch tactics that Dollar pulled on my employee at the time of the rental is their customer service after the fact. I contacted them on December 8th, 2011 with a complaint and here is the response that I got this morning, January 18th, 2012. Mr. Sparks is my employee, I clearly stated in my communications that I was his boss and the one that set up the reservation. They obviously didn't read my email very carefully, or my huge signature and contact information at the bottom. This is absolutely unacceptable!\n\n\nDear Mr. Sparks,\n\nThank you for notifying us of your recent experience with Dollar Rent A Car in Phoenix.  We appreciate the opportunity to assist.\n\nWe disclose all rental charges at the commencement of the rental to inform you of all charges and to explain the benefit of any protection you select.  A review of your rental contract indicates your acceptance of the LDW by your signature acknowledging the charge.  Final review of your rental information confirms all amounts appear to be in order.  Based on the available information, I must respectfully decline your request for a refund of the amount in question.\n\nAt Dollar Rent A Car, we strive to provide quality products and friendly, efficient service.  You are a valued customer and your comments are extremely important to us. Thank you once again, Mr. Sparks, for taking the time to notify us of this situation.  We look forward to serving you again soon at Dollar Rent A Car. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEbony Harding\nCustomer Service Representative\n\n\n\n\n\nCase ID: 1728097
2 ||| First and foremost I would like to say that the food here is absolutely incredible. The fried rice and the tokontsu shoyu are a must with every visit. It's the service that makes them lack from a full 5 stars. I have been here multiple times and have never had any issues however tonight out server Chizuru gave us some of the rudest service.. We ordered fried rice to share and she basically threw it at our table without giving us an extra plate or silver wear and had some major attitude when I asked for what she lacked in giving us. Not once after we got our food did she ask how we were doing, however the cute girl with the glasses and long ponytail who wasn't even our server made sure we were okay. I will ultimately return for more ramen because it is amazing I will just hope Chizuru gets an attitude adjustment before then!
2 ||| I love everything Japan-related, so when I saw this festival first advertised I posted the event on yelp.  I bought $5 advance tickets at Japan Creek Market.  I planned to go at the beginning because our Saturday was full of to-do list items.  We arrived around 11:15 AM.  Some of the vendors for food were not yet open, but the ramen line was already enormous.  Since I don't eat pork, there was no need for me to stand in line, and Eric was unsure if he wanted to do that anyway.  We started with okonomiyaki (sans mayo) - it was okay but we just love Hiroshima-style and this one was Osaka-style and rather bland.  I got in the takoyaki line and saw one of my students taking orders.\n\nI ordered the takoyaki with mentaiko sauce, and it was the best thing I had all day.  Super hot and soft inside with tako, outside crisp, covered in mentaiko sauce, green onion, bonito flakes, and shredded nori.  It came with 7 which was a great deal and I got iced green tea.  Eric R. decided to get honey toast from Ichiza (he made them remake it because they gave him a completely burnt toast) and I got brussel sprouts from Yonaka as soon as they opened.  Curry Zen was not ready to open, Kyara served no food (only drinks) though they had a cool seating area, Snowflake was not there yet, Yu-yu only had a few kushiage options, and Raku had a really long line.\n\nI offered to get in the ramen line with Eric when it got shorter but he was full.  The stage performances and games were cool - Eric R. tried to play rock-paper-scissors for gift certificates to restaurants but lost.  I agree with Nelson that the vendor options for the \"market\" were limited, so there was not much to see.  I also wish the drink booth associated with the ramen line was separate and took cash instead of requiring people to wait in the ramen line to buy drinks, since there were more options there than at some food booths.  Plus, the drink booth at the entrance was price gouging whereas most restaurant booths sold bottled water for $1 and Calipico/green tea for $2.
0 ||| What a shit hole!\nIf you are thinking about going here - STOP.\nThis place makes me want to take up smoking so I can subdue my appetite. It's dirty, the food is of questionable quality.\n\nPlease stop giving your money to this place.
3 ||| NASCAR 101:  Top 10 tips for those novice fans.\n\n1. Shirt, optional. Sunscreen, essential.\n2. Don't bother getting all dressed up. From the draft of the cars, dirt will fly around and land all over you. So forgo wearing a flowy skirt too...\n3. Ear plugs are a must! Protect those ear drums and for as little as $2, you can be rest assured.\n4. You can bring a small cooler! Do it. The race is long & hot...and water is $4 a bottle.\n5. If you don't bring your own cooler, then carry cash. If you don't have cash, bring your ATM card. There are BofA kiosks all over.\n6. The closest seats to the track aren't necessarily the best (like in other sporting events). If you desire seeing a greater view of the entire track, go higher.\n7. It's not essential to get there on time. The cars go round and round and it doesn't get exciting until closer to the end.\n8. If you are an environmentalist, this sport will drive the \"Mother Earth\" in you insane! There will be empty cans of beer & trash flying all over...not to mention one of the main parts of this sport is using a lot of fuel.\n9. You will smell a lot of fumes, feel the vibration of the cars, and see blurs whiz by...if you get motion sick, take breaks from the track.\n10. Beer bongs are encouraged...don't forget yours, but I'm sure you can find someone who will share theirs.\n\nThe roar of the engines is really exciting! I really liked watching how fast and flawless the pit crews worked too. It's quite the experience to be there live! \n\nAfter my first race, I read more about the sport...pretty interesting. I think the next time I go, I'm definitely renting a radio so I can listen in on the drivers and announcers. Everyone should go at least once!
4 ||| I HIGHLY recommend Uptown Bridal for anyone searching for their perfect wedding dress. The staff is really really friendly and helpful. They're all very knowledgeable about the designers and styles they carry. Ali was the one that helped me, and was really patient with me in trying to find my dress - there were two that I couldn't decide between, and she helped me get dressed in them multiple times to compare.\n\nAlso, the day of my appointment, there was a parade going on on the main street out front, so they actually called me up the day before to give me a heads up and give me directions to go the back-way - really impressed me before I even went in. \n\nI went to two other boutiques, but there was something missing from the experience at those two places. One had great dresses but not-so-great service. The other was lacking on both the dresses and the customer service.\n\nSo I was happy when they fit me in to come back in on a Saturday evening right before closing so I could have one last look. My girl was busy, so the owner of the store actually made room for me and helped me try on the dresses - talk about customer service. I ended up finding the perfect dress and am so excited to go back in for my fitting.\n\nAgain...HIGHLY recommend them to anyone shopping for wedding dresses.
0 ||| Had an appointment scheduled with them a month in advance. Was hosting a special event at my home. Received a invoice morning of scheduled cleaning however when the appointment time came and passed nobody showed.  The owner Quian wouldn't answer her phone and the man at the office said he would have her call me and she never did. Very unreliable. Would not recommend this company.
2 ||| So I finally got to try this place after reading all the reviews and check-ins that my fellow yelpers had.\n\nUnfortunately, it really isn't the best buffet I have had. Nothing was horrible nor was anything super delicious. I just found that the cheapest and nothing ordinary type dishes are simply the best they had here. I suppose the drinks are pretty cool as drinks, beer, and wine are all included. They had ROOT BEER on tap! As a root beer lover, this also fell flat. It was just simply too sweet! You can make yourself a root beer float as the ice cream area is just right next to it.\n\nOther than that, I would say save your tummy and drive a little further to what we all refer to as the VEGAS STRIP. Oh, and one more thing, the line is super long. Good Luck!
2 ||| Popped in here for a dinner with friends and having only been here for lunch I had yet to try the BBQ.  I ended up splitting the big boy plate (I forget the actual name) with my girlfriend.  All the BBQ on the plate was delicious although I thought the chicken BBQ was a bit too dry.  That's a hard one to keep from drying out though.  The pulled pork was good and moist.\n\nThe interior is a little dated but I'm doubtful any of the patrons of this place really care.  It's got a pretty cool neighborhood feel.  The service was great and friendly.\n\nBottom line is, there are so many great choices for BBQ in Charlotte, this place is easy to overlook.  It just didn't stand out to me.
0 ||| casual. loud. ghetto. creeps and cheap half naked Butter-faces (everything is good but her face!!). \n\new never again.
2 ||| We waited 10 minutes for our food. We ordered 2 chocolate shakes. Twice. Never got them. Let them know and were still charged for it. The guy (emilio or emelio) left during the middle of making the first one. He was very sloppy and confused. Speaking of sloppy, thanks for the terribly thrown together animal style fries. 12Am. Midnight. Is when we went.
3 ||| Wish I could give 3.5 but I'll round up just bc the lady taking our order at the bar was nice and patient with us ordering. Came in here just looking for something to eat on the way back to the hotel and ordered the Royale with cheese, and it was cheesy goodness! The caramelized onions made it that much better. I would order this burger again although if I had to choose I'd go to Gordon Ramsay's BURGR at PH. The burger there was slightly better there to me.
2 ||| Went here for breakfast and it was just okay. The vegan options were minimal and our meal was just ehh.
3 ||| 400 reviews, baby!!!\n\nthe MGM grand garden arena is definitely worth my 400th review...or maybe just the reason i was there made it more worthwhile.  i'm not really a big fan of vegas, cuz uhhhh...most of the time, vegas hates me and vice versa.  i give and give and give...and all vegas does is take and take and take.  it's a very unhealthy relationship for me.  so i usually try to avoid vegas at all costs, especially during holiday weekends.  but this trip was an exception...\n\ni was lucky enough to score some tickets to the big ufc fight through a photographer that i recently worked with.  i just love my job. :)  he definitely hooked me up!  i got to have my first experience at the garden arena and watch my first ufc fight...actually, my first real fight...period.  i don't even really know much about ufc or fighting but why in the world would i pass up this opportunity?  it would be totally unacceptable.  \n\nthe arena is located pretty deep in the MGM...i think...or we just went the wrong way and walked all the way around.  and of course, silly me was wearing heels.  i just don't ever learn.  hey, a girl has a right to wear cute shoes whenever she wants!  parking wasn't too bad considering the big event but we did get there pretty early to try to catch the first fight.  \n\ni don't think there are really any bad seats in the house.  the octagon is in the middle and there are big screens everywhere to get a better view of what's going on in there.  of course, there are bars all over the place so alcohol wouldn't be a problem.  this is vegas, damn it!  i didn't visit the bar tho.  i think that was the first time i actually stayed sober in vegas.\n\nall in all it was good times.  the venue was great for my first real right...and quite possibly, my last.
4 ||| I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for Tokyo House. I've been frequenting this establishment since I was weaned off my mother's nipple. All the time, people ask me: \"How'd you grow to be so tall and handsome?\" I don't tell them that it was genetics. I tell them that it was all the good eatin' at Tokyo House.\n\nMy mom told me that when I was born my head was four times larger than my body, and because of my explosive bouts of infantile diarrhea, I wasn't able to gain weight. In layman terms, my head-to-body ratio was way out of whack, and it started creating all sorts of health problems. The doctor said that my huge head was consuming so many calories that it destroyed my immune system and put the rest of my body in a state of malnutrition. He told my poor mother that I only had two weeks before my head consumed my little limbs. Thirteen days after the doctor's diagnosis, I looked like a pink balloon on a limp string (the string being my last identifiable extremity, if you know what I mean.) My string started receding into my head like a toddler sucking up a wet spaghetti noodle. My mother thought that it was the end for me. She didn't know a better way to send me out of this cruel world than to serve me a proper last supper. She drove us to Tokyo House, ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, whispered her goodbyes to me, and stuffed my head with that magical food. \n\nI owe my life to Tokyo House. It's because of them (and the awesome Asian man at the front register) that I'm alive today.
1 ||| don't know why people think it's great. service is whatever and the crepe and pastries aren't even good. and the ice cream amount is freaking small!! the only reason why i give it two stars is cuz of the two cute girls that i saw. not amazing in my opinion. had better crepes and pastries.
2 ||| Picked up filled croissants for myself and the boys this morning.  \nThey were a little overbaked today but still tasty.\nI still miss the original place that was I'm the strip mall a couple suites down.\nPrice has increased twice, at least, for individual croissants since it changed ownership.  Quality of croissants has not improved and if anything it seems to have gone from alright to mediocre.  Sometimes lacking filling, sometimes looking especially small -c'mon, for the price you don't want something that's a tad bigger than a grocery store cinnamon fry.\nI rather they would get rid of all the new flavors they've added and simply offer a better quality product that was brought over from the original store/owner/baker(s).\n\nBecause the price of one croissant has gone up again I have opted to pick up treats to deliver to friends or a business (the staff at my vets office) from an excellent bakery that's across town.\nMore options and more for my money too.
3 ||| My fiance and I went to The Green Mango for a quick lunch on a weekday and we were super impressed. We'd heard great things about this place and we were not disappointed. The lunch menu has tons of vegetarian options, service is quick, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. The spring rolls (vegetarian) were delicious; they were stuffed with fresh vegetables and were nice and crispy without being greasy. For entrees, we got the vegetable curry and the pad thai. Both were delicious--nothing was over- or under-cooked and the entrees were fresh and nicely seasoned. \n\nWe had a tiny miscommunication with our server that was no one's fault; we just misunderstood one another. The problem was fixed promptly and as soon as he realized the error, our server came over to our table and gave us a sincere apology.\n\nGreat menu, great food; I can't wait to go back.
2 ||| We had to try it after golf. Food was OK. Scenery was very nice and extremely young. Why do 18 year old girls think that tatoos on their bodies make them attractive??
0 ||| I've been a long-time fan of \"Pawn Stars\", so when \"Pawn Shop Live!\" came along, I grabbed two tickets immediately.\nI spent regular intervals of the show quietly apologizing to the person I roped into coming with me. I also regularly asked, \"Why is this happening?\"\nMuch of the play is exposition. LONG exposition. At these times, there is no joy, no humor, and no smiling. \nMost of the rest of the play is spend with a nod to the fact that the \"Old Fart\" is portrayed by a weird, giant puppet upper-torso, operated by the over-worked actor giving this play (and his many different parts in it) his all. At times the torso is abandoned to sit on the stage as the actor plays another part. Everyone winks and nods and plays up the fact that the production is too... cheap, I'm guessing... to just hire an old man actor to play one of the most central figures in the story.This becomes unbearable as the Rick character carries on ad nauseum about his dad, when the \"old Fart\" should be out there telling the story himself.\nAs if all of this weren't tedious enough, there is a multi-media aspect in the videos they cut to from time to time. These are rudimentary at best, but there is a dream sequence the with \"Chumlee\" character where he's fighting ninjas for no reason that goes on to the point where I thought I might lose my mind.\nThe production ends with a rousing musical number about how you should bring your stuff to them because they want to but it. CRESCENDO! \nSave your money, wait a few hours, and go see Gordie Brown.
4 ||| I lost my bahn mi virginity here. I had no expectations, but I was treated with a great sandwich that cost me $3.29. The crust was actually softer than I was expecting. The jalape\u00f1o was a nice touch with the pickled carrots and daikon, just the right amount of heat that also added that freshness along with the cilantro. I even got a watermelon boba to wash it all down and it was a perfect way to finish the meal.
3 ||| I ate hear the other day.  My fiance and I wanted to try it out for fun and it was actually really good.  I had the Cubano sandwich which was very tasty and the fries seamed to be freshly cut.  I will be going back.
2 ||| There are a couple of amazing wood sculptures in the place.  The food however, is not as noteable.\n\nThe food is average or typical of Thai cuisine.  The dishes are standard and taste and look like what thai food should, however, nothing stood out as being anything more than average.  I am wondering if I am being to critical and if yelp should have 2 rating systems.  1 rating for how a place might compare against local establishments, and another rating for the restaurant nationally.\n\nWith that in mind, of the 2 places in Charlotte I have tried for thai, this is clearly the better.
0 ||| horrible. did bunionectomy and hammertoe surgery and botched them both. when confronted, he said, \"what do you want me to do?\". when I said \"I'd like you to fix it\", he said, I can't do that for free. \n\nhave to do it again. this time not taking ay chances and doing it at hospital for special surgery in nyc.\n\nawful. don't make the mistake I did.
0 ||| A rating of 0.5 would be more appropriate.  Our dinner at this coffee shop proved to be disappointing.  Ann ordered the fresh salmon which came with mashed potatoes, salad and mixed vegetables.  I ordered the halibut, salad, roasted potatoes and the same mixed vegetables. Both pieces of fish were overcooked and everything else was below mediocre with the exception of the veggies.  I thought we could salvage our dinner with slices of their highly acclaimed pies. Ann chose chocolate cream while I settled on coconut custard.  Each was probably the equivalent of a Mrs. Smith's frozen pie though, in all honesty, I have never had a Mrs. Smith's pie so I may be insulting Mrs. Smith.  One last note - our server was crabby.
0 ||| Hello everyone, \n\nI had to create a Yelp account just to inform people how HORRIBLE this hotel really is. Where to start. We got in on a Friday, when we got to the room it smelled horrible. The TP holder was under the sink in the corner with TP rolls sitting on the counter. They must of been to lazy to pick it up and put it back. After I fixed that I sat down to relax and watch some TV.. Well that was a JOKE! I turned on the TV and every channel was staticky and couldn't watch... Yes, I had a nice view of the pool. But as I opened the sliding door to the balcony (which you could only take one step out on and no room to move) the door almost FELL off. I had to catch it before it went over the railing...... The carpets were filthy!! Location SUCKS! After the horrible weekend at hooters I was so glad to get home to a nice clean environment.. I get a call from hooters saying we got charged an extra $300 for the \"Damages\" . WORST HOTEL EVER DO NOT STAY HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND UPGRADE TO THE MOTEL 6 NEXT DOOR.
4 ||| To start, this is my first Yelp review! So here it goes! \nThis is one of the best \"Dive Bars\" I've experienced. Great Bartenders, very friendly and attentive! Good beer selection, they have Blue Moon & Kilt Lifter so I approve :). Regular drink prices are not that bad!!  They have HUGE portions of food that I ate way too much of....and also for a really decent price. We started with a 1/2 dozen sweet chili wings. Holy. Moly. Huge wings, and beyond delicious! Next: the burgers. Another Holy. Moly. moment. They had to be at least a 1/2 pounder! I ordered the California Dreamin' Burger with Swiss, Bacon, and Avocado: YUMM!! You can also get this with chicken instead of as a burger, but I just had to splurge! What made this burger even more worth purchasing is that I have the other half of it saved for another lunch or dinner :) The atmosphere is great. Lots and lots of TV's for those sports fans, but they also play non-sports shows too for people like me to be entertained by :) They even have individual TV's at each booth! It is a very clean and fun place to hangout with friends. \n5 stars in my book. Everything about this place was enjoyable!
0 ||| Let me begin by saying I'm totally disappointed and outraged at the aftercare, customer care, quality of work and Mark!!!!!!!! My problem is Mark and the fact that I called to make them aware that my hard top convertible will not work(this is after they just fixed my trunk, and replacing parts and the wiring system and lots of other stuff, that's all tired in to my convertible mechanisms). Mark wanted to engage in an argument and basically insinuate to me that it was something I did. \nGood year had previously repaired my trunk, which is my convertible, being that the hood folds into it. When i asked to bring my car back so they can look at my car and fix my convertible he told me, \" We don't do convertibles,\" I then said to Mark, why did you bother with my car to begin with, bcz my trunk is my convertible.. It's all tied in together? He then elevated his voice and basically told me to get off his line and call my warranty company...... Now that they've gotten their $$$$ what do they care now!!!!! \n\nLet me state this, I'm a single woman, I don't know much about repairing a car, but I know a lot about customer service and quality care. When your customers trust you, we become repeat customers because you stand behind your work and reputation. I don't blame the company Goodyear,  just some of the people it employs. \n\nEnd result... I am taking my car to the dealer to be repaired.... I've tried local repair shops and the customer care and quality of work is simply unacceptable!!!!! \n\nI am a hard critic. If you claim to be the best at what you do.... I expect no less. Not once did I call Goodyear screaming and yelling or rude to them at any time. I could write more of my experience, but I will leave it at this..
1 ||| I hate writing this update because I used to really love Apple Spice, but the last three times we have ordered lunch there have been multiple mistakes. For a place that does catering, getting 10 lunches right doesn't really seem like too much to ask.\n\nToday, two people ordered bread bowls. They received a very small container of soup with a slice of bread. That is not really a bread bowl.\n\nMe and one of my vegan co-workers ordered the southwestern salad, sans cheese. It came with chicken, and on the menu it states you have to pay an additional $1 for chicken, so it would definitely be something someone needed to ask for.\n\nOne of the lunches came as a sandwich instead of a wrap, and Heather W. was missing her cookie and her juice with her meal.\n\nApple Spice was nice enough to replace the mistaken items (brought corrected salads, brought the actual bread bowls - although, not with new soup, brought the wrap) and bring us an extra plate of cookies, but like I said, this is the third time this type of mistake has happened. \n\nIt's pretty expensive, the Southwestern is not even very good, and once the order comes back wrong it delays my eating for an hour + and it is just frustrating.\n\nI'm sorry Apple Spice... you guys are great but you need to get it together.
4 ||| I just recently moved to Vegas and of course I had to find a place that I can go to regularly to get my eyebrows done. I had tried a couple of places that I found on Yelp, but none of them were quite satisfactory until I came across Diva Beauty. Though there are cheaper places around, it is well worth the price. I normally don't care too much about how the place looks as long as they do their job, but this place looks great.. very modern and chic. What I love the most is that their chairs are seated far enough to allow each person some privacy (this experience can be uncomfortable for some)! The employees are friendly and know what they are doing. I have very sensitive skin and so I always \"break out\" around my forehead near my eyebrows whenever I get them done, but the lady that did mine was excellent! No breakouts and it didn't hurt as much as it usually does for me. She took her time to clean them up real nicely and made sure they weren't too thin. I would recommend this place for anyone both girls and guys. :) Happy yelping!
1 ||| I'll be honest I was not impressed with the food. Very in seasoned and greasy. Service was slow. I also received a dirty water glass and silverware. This was my first and last visit. I give it 2 stars because the cost is low.
1 ||| Wow this place has crazy prices for a sandwich come on get real I don't understand what justifies paying so much for a soup or a sandwich and the portions are extremely small do yourself a favor and pass unless you have money to blow
4 ||| My favorite Restaurant in Phoenix by far, I keep searching for better, but who knows why!\n\nDishes that separate Tarbell's from others:\n\n Soups to die for\n Caesar the way it was meant to taste\n Pommes Frites as heavenly as any in Paris or \n                                     Brussels\n Sliders to crave many days after\n Scotch Beef I continue to dream about\n Pan Roasted chicken - I NEVER order chicken in a \n                                     Restaurant, except here\n Mac & Cheese good enough for dessert\n\nIf this isn't FIVE STAR in Phoenix, I can't imagine what is, but I want to go there!
0 ||| Burnt garlic toast. Oh there's supposed to be garlic on that? Decent wings but half of the 1 pound plate was comprised of batter \"nuggets\". And the pie. Uncooked soggy dough crust. Extra napkins provided to soak up the grease on this half baked abomination. Service was abysmal too. Do you think that when 3 of 5 have left the place we might want the check and aren't going to stick around for dessert? Sorry I just cannot recommend this place to anyone.
3 ||| I have a lot of idiot moments. Like when I ordered the \"tart with the pear on it\" and the woman behind the counter said \"Oh, the pear tart?\" Yeah, that. \n\nWell, luckily the pear tart was amazing. I'd been craving some kind of pear tart for months. Not really sure why. I had a frozen coffee drink which was also fabulous and for a cappuccino, it wasn't too bitter and just the right amount of sweet.\n\nWe got a little turned around trying to find it (don't spend much time at palazzo) and when asking for it, most of the staff just refer to it as \"the Italian coffee place\". Probably safe to just ask for that. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice and a little less Vegas-y than the usual coffee shops. Felt almost like I could be in a train station somewhere other than the middle of the desert.
2 ||| This is a rough looking little strip mall place. The kind of place you see all over the Valley. If you want atmosphere look elsewhere. \n\nWe tried a few different things--tacos, torta and assorted other things. The food was all pretty good--not the best in the world, but good. Tacos are a $1 each. \n\nPrices were awesome and the service was pretty good also. There's not too much else to say about it.
2 ||| I had dinner at Frank and Alberts when my family came to visit and stayed at the Biltmore. Great service and a nice atmosphere. The food received mixed reviews by our table. Three people in our party ordered the caesar salad after the waiter highlighted it. Their special twish was celery, which we all assumed was mixed in for extra crunch. It turns out the entire salad is shaved celery. The celery was just way too stringy and fibrous to really enjoy, plus it watered down the flavor of the caesar dressing. Nice attempt at a twist, but I would say leave that classic alone. \n\nOn the positive side, I did really enjoy the burger - great flavor and the homemade chipotle ketchup was awesome (they also have homemade tarragon mustard). My cousin had the meatloaf which looked amazing. He's a 6'2' 16 year old athlete with a refined palate... I didn't even have a chance to ask for a bite before he devoured it, but he said it was awesome. \n\nMy experience here was good (hence the A-OK rating), but didn't leave me wanting come back for more. What did, however, was their happy hour menu: lots of great looking deals for $5. I'll have to head over for hh and will update my review.
2 ||| I usually associate shop front arrangement of fruit and veg with shabby looking punnets of strawberries, bruised fruit and the faint whiff of over ripe apples. \n\nSuccessfully battling this stereotype is Zain Halal food store which unlike the above has a well kept selection of fresh fruit on display outside the entrance.  You'll find the usual pears, pineapples and grapes etc but with a tempting freshness not usually found in such grocery shops.\n\nCheap too.
3 ||| I really like the patio here and am looking forward to sitting next to the fire this winter. I love spicy food and New Mexican food in particular and this place does not disappoint. The copper bar is pretty cool, but the patio is unique and my favorite place to sit. My only complaint is that the several times I have been here service has been fairly slow. The servers were always friendly though. Sitting at the bar things seemed to move a little faster. Overall a local favorite of mine.
0 ||| Hmmm. Bait and switch? Got a flier from a representative from this place and they won't honor their advertisement. It's says that you get a custom pizza and salad made from scratch all at a respectful price of 7.75 I thought that was a great deal until I called and the guy who answered said it was either or not for both. Sucks because I heard that their pizza is not bad but I'm not going to spend my hard earned money at a place that won't honor their mistakes. Good luck Fired Pie.
3 ||| My wife and I tried the vegetarian and reina pepiada arepa.  Both were delicious.  Just the right size and priced right.  Staff was friendly and the place was very clean and comfortable.
1 ||| Our service was extremely slow the night that we visited.  We waited, and waited, and waited for our food.  I tried to give them more of my money by trying to order more drinks while we waited, but our server did not jump at the opportunity to run up the check and get a better tip.  So not only did we wait for our food way longer than my patience could handle, we also were left hanging with dry cups for most of the duration of our wait for our food  =(\n\nOnce the food came out I was not impressed with the carne asada.  I probably should of just stuck with the tacos.  \n\nI was very disappointed that I wasted my time and money at this place with all of the other options for great food in Vegas.
1 ||| Seems like Monti's used to be allot better.  Last time I went, 6-5-12 for dinner, service and food quality were about 2 stars.  My prime rib tasted dry and old, the Roman Bread was 1/4\" thick and the dough was tough, and my Baked Potato was old tasting and turning a little brown from oxidation.  The salad was OK.  The service was only fair, at best. Not what I expect for the prices they are charging.  The last couple of meals I have gotten there have been Meh, as well.  I think Monti's has become arrogant and complacent, from year of sucess, and now dosen't worry too much about maintiaining food quality or great service.  They always say there is a small wait, even if the place is empty.  I never have understood that policy.  I guess there are enough fans or new Tempe visitors to keep Monti's going, even as they severely decline in quality.
1 ||| The Salty Sow has a great atmosphere but it's a bit over priced & not a very good value.  We ordered the charcuterie and cheese board, which was very good.  The service was very prompt.  However, I asked the waiter for a recommendation between one of two salads for my entree.  Based on his recommendation I chose the Trout Salad, which was good but was very small and was only half the size of the other salad for the same price.  Unfortunately this left me not feeling very satisfied, particularly since I spent $40 for two drinks, a small salad and an appetizer split 4 ways.  If I'm spending that much I shouldn't be leaving the restaurant hungry.
1 ||| I wanted to go to eat the Pho instead of the coffee shop part of this place, but it was noon and none of us have had breakfast so I just go with the flow. When we got it, they seated us far away from the cash register near the Pho side which I thought was strange. Got the menu and started looking at the choices and a lady came up to us to ask for our drinks. We all got water except my husband got an orange juice. She asked if he wanted a small or a large and he told her a small, but she then told him that a large was the size of our water which was probably less than 8oz. I was like what the heck, that's a large!?!? and it's $6!!?!?! What a rip off, but he got it anyway. I got some breakfast item that had meat in it. I don't even remember what it was and my friend got a sandwich. All in all, the food was basic and not good. Price was over the top and the lady who provided the drinks had an attitude. She dropped our water on our table and walked away and when she did take our water order, it was with an attitude. Two big thumbs down.
3 ||| This place was good and found this on the internet.  Anyways I wished I had the sushi, but I was sick so I went with the noodles which was good. It was nice and hot and filled my belly. I loved the salad as well.  I wished I had the other dishes, but it is okay though.  I would come back here again.
2 ||| It's a crazy place that takes a PhD in hypergeometry to understand how to order. Inventive food, if you're up for that sort of thing. with the unique choices and variations they gave me a sampler of everthing so I could make up my mind.\n\nWhat you've heard about the snookerdoodle is correct. My theory is it's laced with nicotine -  it's addictive.\n\nI marked yes on wait service because it was slow and the owner brought our food over, he probably doens't always do this.
0 ||| This place is ridiculous! I went in to get a smoothie and there was no one there except me and the two friends of the employees there. They finally noticed me and asked me what I wanted, made it and the guy just put his hand out for money when he did not even tell me what the amount was. This happened on September 1, 2014 at about 230pm. Unprofessional and will not be going back to this place!!!! Horrible! I hope management sees this and does something.
3 ||| This is one of my favorite movie theaters in the Charlotte area, despite my lack of enthusiasm for shopping malls.  I normally attend movies in the late afternoons or evenings during the week and I don't purchase snacks or drinks; however, I'm super appreciative of this theater being clean and easy to locate within the mall (down at the end, across from Forever 21).  The movie schedules are great and I have even seen a few movies here that most other theaters do not show.  (For example, Dallas Buyers Club.)  There are electronic ticket kiosks if you don't want to wait in line for a ticket and I've always been a fan of the lighting near the entrance of the theater.  It doesn't really feel like you're in the middle of an outlet mall.  (Thank goodness.)  I'd give this theater five stars if the seats reclined.  :-)
0 ||| my husband and I bought a car there and it was a nightmare! They sold it as a low miles good running car it was a lemon. we had it back several times and always excuses. It finally blew up for good less than 6 months after we bought it. They are dishonest to the point of they super glued the glove box handle back on and tried to cover up the smell saying windows were open to let it dry after shampooing. It wasn't shampooed yet the other guy told me that. Ridiculous! They are crooks...Watch out!!
1 ||| 1st pizza was a salt mine.  The 2ed had no cheese or sauce and needed a steak knife to cut.  Chicken parm was so-so.  Five stars for the staff who tried to make up for the kitchens's shortcomings.  Maybe 2.5 at best.  Also small pours of wine.
2 ||| I see Cafe Anfora is getting a bit of grief for their bathroom....!! It's a cafe, not a toilet - the toilet is a minor detail.\n\nANYWAY, the cafe itself isn't too bad! It serves cakes etc, when I asked if they had anything for lunch they said there was a wee problem in the kitchen, they were lovely about it so I wasn't too bothered. Ok my scone was a bit chewy, but it was edible. My coffee was nice and warm, just how I like it, but I noticed some people turning their back because it was too cold. Uhoh.\n\nIt's not bad, but it's not amazing either, and the toilets make it different!
4 ||| Stopped by with my friend after work for the first time a few weeks ago. Not a HUGE coffee drinker but I love teas. I ordered a hot chai latte so that I could get a fancy design. I asked the nice lady at the register if they are able to make designs and she reassured me that that they can. Once I picked up my drink I was highly disappointed! There wasn't a design!! I spoke with the barista and he said they never make designs for chai tea lattes. What a let down. But such is life. \n\nI took a lovely pic of my friends fancy design and was content. We say up stairs at the loft like section. I adored the writings on the walls and the library if real encyclopedias.  \n\nI almost forgot to mention the yummy gluten free cookie and macaroons I had as well. In love with the decor, chai latte was yummy, and the gluten free treats were a huge plus! Its a bit pricey but a nice place stop by to change it up a bit. I will def be returning!
3 ||| The Pho was delicious, the place was cute, and the prices were decent. Also, the service was amazing! The waiter offered to warm up my son's bottle. Good service goes a long way, so we will definitely be back!
2 ||| Bojangles used to be some of the best chicken in Charlotte, well I see a lot have changed- JJ's Fish is much better
0 ||| Went to this Chipotle tonight, ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked, hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.
2 ||| I am trying to broaden my Thai food horizons as my normal stop (Siri Thai) has become awful at answering the phone.\n\nThis place is somewhat near me and had decent reviews, so I tried it out for a weekend to-go lunch.  I ordered the tofu pad Thai spicy 3 (their scale is 1-10) over the phone and the lady said, \"It will be ready in 5 minutes.\"\n\nEep!  I had to throw on some pants and leave because the drive is a little bit longer than that.  Certainly not the worst problem in the world, though.\n\nThe location is easy-to-find and I parked right in the front.  The restaurant itself is nice and spacious, clean and overall a nice atmosphere.  I saw my order was right on the counter, so I paid with the friendly lady and left.\n\nThe tofu is certainly superior to Siri Thai but I think it's still lacking a little bit of that tofu texture that I personally enjoy.  The pad Thai was lacking peanuts but the overall flavor was good and the heat was there but certainly not overwhelming - exactly what I wanted.  There was a bit of a citrus flavor that I simply don't like with my pad Thai, but it was much more subtle than other places I've tried.  Also, they were generous with egg and green onion which I love!\n\nWhile I have not found my new pad Thai spot (damn you, Siri Thai), I think I have found a new place to put into my pickup regime.  The pictures of pad see ew look delicious and I still need to try their Thai tea as I feel that's necessary at ANY Thai place.  -:3
0 ||| Bad bad bad. first they don't have carne asada. Second they serve blain taco meat with no flavor. They charged me $11.75 for 2 tacos with rice and beans. At the airport gouging prices are to be expected. But an extra $1 for watered down salsa mad the experience worse. I will never eat here again because the food was disgusting.
4 ||| great food! friendly staff!! pumpkin curry is freaking delicious!!!
0 ||| This place is laughable and pretentious. \nWe went in for breakfast on a Saturday morning, the 20 minute wait was expected and the least of our worries. \nThe server was by far the worst experience i have ever seen, after the second failed attempt at taking our drink order the yahoo finally decided to write it down (there were only 4 people in our party - 3 coffee's, 2 waters, an iced tea and a large OJ - even i remember that). . It took about 5 minutes for the drinks to stagger to our table.\nAfter sitting for about 10-15 minutes we finally placed our order, again (i should have known based on our drink order experience that this was going to be a long/bad experience). Again our order was written down (not that i fault a server for taking the time to do it right, its just a shock to see these days outside of a 5&Diner). 5 minutes later the server approached our table to notify me that the kitchen didn't have a component to the order i placed, not the end of the world but the time in which it took to become aware of it was the alarming part, how long did that guy really take to place our order? (just a little glimpse into our experience with this nameless server, when ordering sausage instead of ham on my mother in-laws eggs Benedict the server asked if she wanted links or patty's..... uhhhhh??? Really?). \nThe food came SUPER FAST, almost annoyingly fast.\nMy husband ordered the chicken and waffles, not what we expected.. A small SMALL waffle and a fried chicken breast - the whole plate looked half a**ed.\nMy eggs Benedict's were acceptable, one of the eggs was completely cooked which means the rest of my plate missed half of the necessary yummy juices from that poor little overcooked egg. not the crime of the century just disappointing. \nmind you the eggs Benedict's do come with your choice of potatoes, so much to our surprise when her order arrived ala carte it was a shock - flagging someone down to advise of the partial order was a challenge. Thank goodness the manager was the one who was able to help. \nLastly i think we watched our busy server buzz around the restaurant for at least 10 minutes after our meal was complete. \n\nAll in all i was NOT impressed, the meal was overpriced, the plates were small (weird i know, but it made our food look awkward), the service was TERRIBLE so 1+1= Not planning on returning. .
0 ||| When our washing machine died, it was back to the land of the laundromats for a couple of weeks.  This was *not* the place to go.  I figured the convenience of having a \"coinless\" wash would be better than getting the rolls of quarters.  Found out later that I had a card that with $10 left that I couldn't get refunds.  Finally sold it to another customer but at least quarters I can spend elsewhere.\n\nOn top of that were the kids running everywhere (parents?!?) and some lady with six poodles that peed (the poodles, not the lady) all over a laundry cart, if I have to use the laundromat again, it won't be here.
0 ||| The food was okay but not great; price is just like any other Chinese restaurants in that area but the waitress there was rude.\nThe plates and tea cup are dirty.\n\nI really cannot find a good reason to eat there!!!!
3 ||| Oh, Anthropologie, how I love thee!  And, oh how I love thee sales even more. I must say, this particular Anthropologie has been my lucky store, as I've been able to find on numerous occasion fabulous deals on clothes.  Just recently, I bought a cute summer dress and skirt for about half-off their original price.  Their houseware and gift items are adorable too and definitely a great way to go for a fantastically unique gift for a girlfriend, sister, mother, etc. My only complaint, and the only reason I give the store four stars, is the clothes are a little pricey.  They are definitely cute and unique, but most of them are made from cotton, which begs the questions... when did cotton t-shirts start costing $55?
3 ||| This particular Buffalo Wild Wings has really great service:  attentive, on time, conversational.  I didn't finish with one glass of iced tea before another was brought by the waitress.  The only thing that distinguishes chain restaurants from their peers is the service, and this BWW has really great service.  Tasty food, great assortment of beverages, and more large screen televisions and those competitive trivia games. But lots of places have stuff like that.  This place has great service!
4 ||| I first contacted Liz after another accountant botched my 2008 taxes and got me in seemingly deep trouble with the IRS. Liz went through line by line and corrected the errors, then wrote a clear and thoughtful letter to the IRS explaining the honest mistake. Highly recommended.
4 ||| I can't believe it's been three years since my first review!  I have been coming here, pretty much every week since then for my endermologie treatments, I love them and is what keeps my skin looking great.  I notice the difference when I skip my treatments while I am in Oregon during the summer.  Debbie also does my Brazilian blowouts.  She does an amazing job.  I have curly hair, but with the BB it makes is so much more manageable.  I do the treatments every 3 to 4 months.  Debbie also does a fantastic job with my haircuts.  I am trusting her with a lot of my beauty needs.
3 ||| Since there was no escaping my worries by whisking myself away to Puerto Vallarta this weekend...I did the next best thing. I over-indulged in scents. 200 of them to be exact.\n\nI took a seat at the bar and instead of ordering a stiff drink, I grabbed a blank paper tab and begin mixing scents. Would it be liquid valium (lavender, mandarin orange and bergamot) or perhaps a little southern tropics (oatmeal, milk & honey and mango)?\n\nNo...I needed something bold and strong. I created what I'd like to call 'therapy'... chocolate, butterscotch and Columbian coffee.\n\nThe next decision was what to mix it in. Face lotions, shampoos, body wash and room mists to name a few. It's all earth friendly and cruelty free. They even have scents and shampoos for the K-9's!
2 ||| One of the best Nordstroms that sell big high fashion brands such as Prada, Balenciaga, Burberry, Chanel, etc.  If you're a fan of Nordstrom, you know some places sell \"cheaper\" clothing than others (if you want the Mercedes of Nordstroms, try visiting the one in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, CA!)  Huge Thanksgiving Sale, with really cute shoes.  Too bad they were still way overpriced and not within my budget.
0 ||| Never thought I would be writing a review for a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. I have worked for them in the past as a supervisor and have worked at several other cafes so I am typically pretty lenient and sympathetic with all baristas in the world.\n\nHaving said that, my girlfriend and I wanted to grab some coffee for the road before checking out from the hotel. They had one girl as an expeditor taking orders to speed up the line. We ordered a reg hazelnut IB and a lg Orchard Peach iced tea. We paid and stepped aside to wait for our drinks. We received two reg sized drinks. No big deal- we let the barista know we had ordered a large iced tea.\n\nConflict resolution at a coffee shop is quite simple. The cost of avoiding an argument and satisfying a customer far outweighs the cost of remaking their order.\n\nHowever, the employee here who decided to give us attitude, state that we had paid for a regular (regardless of the expeditor coming over and letting her know she had took the order for a large), and walked away after giving us back the regular sized tea obviously does not share my views.\n\nSo double and triple check your order when you ring up everyone, cus they will NOT fix it for you.
2 ||| Decent place, good food, great  atmosphere to watch a game. Thank god the karaoke was not there tonight. Service could be better, mainly faster. The servers are spread too thin, as there seem to never be enough top handle the crowd. Otherwise a decent pace too have a drink, grab a bite and watch sports.
1 ||| I like the produce selection and pricing at sprouts. The prices and service we're definitely better when this market was Sunflower Market .  The one complaint I have is, many times coming in the item will scan incorrectly.  The customer service is very much lacking at the front end, the meat counter has good product but sometimes is a little pricey
1 ||| \"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\"  I think that's how the saying goes... and I usually stick to this saying but since I'm a yelper, I have to be honest about my experience at Jacqueline's Cafe.\n\nI admit, I read the reviews prior, many of them not so positive, but I was still optimistic that I would like Jacqueline's.  It's in a convenient location in the Hilton Village shopping center and it looks bright, colorful, and fun from the outside.  There's also a ton of option on the menu.  So I dragged Lindsey F with me to lunch earlier this week.  \n\nWe were greeted and seated in a timely manner... and our server was sweet.  We ordered ice water with lemon and a hummus appetizer to start.  The water tasted like it wasn't filtered and the hummus had a tang to it that wasn't a good tang.  (I think I've tasted hummus with a tang when it's sat too long in my refrigerator in the past).  I will say the pita that came with it was warm and tasty though.\n\nWe each ordered salads, and they were huge portions.  They looked good but a few bites in and we both agreed that they looked much better than they tasted.  The egg, chicken, and avocado that came in my Cobb Salad tasted processed, and the dressing was really thick.  Needless to say, I barely made a dent in it.\n\nSo there you have it, my honest review of Jacqueline's Cafe.  The two star rating says it all: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Sorry Jacqueline's - I wish you luck but I will probably not be back for another mediocre meal.
2 ||| I've been here twice, both for flair bartending competitions. The first time we had a great time, however the bartender wasn't great at giving us service. We would have to wait long intervals before each round. The second time we sat at the tables, ordered drinks and food. Both servers we had, Jenny and Amy, were great. We got the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (yum!!) and shrimp jammers (different but good). I'll continue coming back for the flair comps, but not much else.
4 ||| Living in L.A. and having a 2nd home in Vegas, I've noticed that home service providers tend to charge more in Vegas, and most deliver less.  After hiring A-List to clean my carpets in Vegas, my theory WAS PROVEN WRONG.   When scheduling an appt., I called on a Monday morning at about 7:30 and left a message.  Al called back immediately.  Per my request for an estimate, Al offered to come by and give an estimate; however, because I was out of town, Al gave me an estimate on the phone based on square footage of carpeting/  He scheduled an appt. for the following Sunday morning (since I was there only for the weekend), showed up early, was friendly, thorough, and TRUSTWORTHY.   His estimate was very competitive to other carpet cleaners, but he did not try to upsell me, and he actually charged me LESS than his estimate.  Most definitely I will use him again, and not because of his price, but because of the quality and thoroughness of his work.   AL, you and Aydin did a great job for me.  THANK YOU!
1 ||| Not very impressed with this joint. This place reminds me of a club/bar you would find in Uptown where being at the trendy place is more important than a well-made drink and good service. \n\nWe walked in on St. Patrick's day to find the place empty (it was during the day). We asked to see a cocktail list and were told there wasn't one. Funny because when I sat down at a table lo and behold there was a  cocktail menu sitting right there. Speaking of the table it was dirty ...along with the sticky menu and the messy floor. To be honest It felt like the closer from the night before never cleaned-up... the bar was unkempt, and downright dirty. Nothing about it made me feel like lounging that's for sure. \n\nWe ordered over-priced vodka sodas which I requested to be served with a twist-of lime. Our bartender told us they didn't have limes. The odd thing was I saw the same individual actually cutting limes less than 5 minutes later....was he that lazy or non-accommodating that he couldn't be bothered to grab a lime from the back and cut it up? Or did limes just magically happen to appear a mere five minutes after our drink was ordered?  He looked like he was completely jacked up on steroids (even had the lime green muscle-tee  to match) so maybe he was on the verge of roid-rage and cutting limes or grabbing a cocktail menu would have sent him over the edge. I suppose I should count myself lucky. \n\nOk, maybe that last part was uncalled for but I was really disappointed with Stashe House . I will say it was a beautiful day so I enjoyed the open seating.  We didn't stay to have another drink but I doubt the bartender cared very much as he didn't ask us how the drinks were or even bother to ask if we wanted another one...or do much of anything actually. I sincerely hope South End doesn't turn into the kind of place filled with bars like this...
2 ||| This Albertson's is okay.  \n\nI find this store to be quite expensive as compared to some of the other stores I have been to, so I don't visit this one very much.  It is close to my house though, so I do end up here occasionally.  They do have a free savings membership card you can get, which you should, that saves you some money.  Even with the membership card, the prices are still high, in my opinion.\n\nThis location is a large store with a lot of options when it comes to food, so that part is nice.  The deli is always well stocked with great sandwich meats and great cheese options.  I love me some good cheese.   They also offer a lot of handmade sides like egg, tuna, and chicken salads, cole slaw, ambrosia, amongst many others.  Whenever I get an egg salad craving I make a beeline to this store to get my fix ASAP.  Oh and the roast chicken here is divine!  The rosemary garlic flavor is delightful.  I am drooling just thinking about it!\n\nI do also have to say that the bakery at Albertson's make the best cakes in the valley.  I have had many cakes from lots of bakeries around town and I think the cakes at Albertson's are by far the yummiest! One of my favorites is the Victorian Lace cake with raspberry filling.  I have never seen it at any other bakery, which is a shame.  It is a beautiful cake and tastes even better! And yes, I have tried the big names like Freed's and I still think Albertson's has an edge on cakes.  What can I say, I LOVE cake!\n\nThis store also has a satellite USPS office inside.  This USPS location is rarely busy and you can get your stamps or mail packages quickly here.  It is a great option to have and is much faster than the main post office for the area on Tenaya.  \n\nThis location also has a Starbucks inside of it.  Yep, you can get your caffeine fix and then power grocery shop.  Talk about efficient shopping!
2 ||| The sushi was surprisingly really good, but the rest of the food was mediocre. The place was clean and service was decent. It's no five star buffet, but my experience was much nicer than the previous reviewers. I would recommend for large parties as there are many options, especially for kids.
4 ||| This was a fun event in a gorgeous location. You have to get there early because they run out of many of the beers fast! As long as the weather's nice, I won't miss this event!
1 ||| Bad experience during my last visit. Found few strands of hair in chicken curry, posted picture. Naan bread was really flat and dry. Not much chicken in curry . Lot of variety and some other food was good. Expensive compared to other buffets. Not sure if I will come back
4 ||| Ahh!! Okay, so I was a bit skeptical to go here just because they are known for their desserts and chocolate, which I am not a big fan of. Maribel T. had made reservations at 11:00 to meet up with her BFF one last time before we head back to Cali. We came here on a Saturday morning and they were pretty busy. I got the cream cheese with bacon and tomato bagel.Loved it, I mean you can't really mess that up, right? Maribel's sister ordered some waffle fries, I had a few and dipped it with the dipping sauce it came with and it was soo freaking delish, Yumm Yum-Yum! Loved it!! (forget about ranch!)\n\nAfter having our entrees, we got the dessert menu. Maribel T. and her sister ordered the Chocolate Pizza with the works and banana waffle. i really didn't want to try the Chocolate Pizza because it was topped with marshmallows and I hate marshmallows, BUT for some reason I kept eating it. There was something about the Chocolate Pizza, it might have been the hazelnut bits and/or the peanut butter that mixed well with the marshmallows. Yummy Yum-Yum! The banana waffle was just as delish! Maribel T. and I also tried their double machiatto served in their kangaroo cup, my was it strong. haha! \n\nThey also have a small little gift shop where you can purchase their mugs, cups, etc. This place is located in the forum shop across from H&M.
1 ||| Attente atrocement longue \nChocolat chaud \u00e0 la limite du buvable (et clairement en poudre, pour quelque chose annonc\u00e9 comme \"chocolat noir 56% blablabla\"\nErreur dans une des commandes\n\nMa cassolette n'\u00e9tait pas assez bonne pour rattraper tout \u00e7a.\n\nD\u00e9\u00e7u
3 ||| Went back for a second time to get the Irish coffee on a cold late afternoon.  The place was empty and there for the service was great.   The bartender was engaging and extremely knowledgeable about whiskey and even gave us some pointers about how to have a better experience and enjoy the whiskey properly.   The place itself is small  but let's not forget that it is inside a sea container but the patio during the afternoon is delightful and make a great perch to watch the playground.   The Boozery is the ONLY BAR IN LAS VEGAS that serves products from our very own Las Vegas Distillery!!!      So go enjoy this unique bar in the very unique setting of container park....
4 ||| from the 22 untill the 27 I had the pleasure of staying at the cosmo a treat for my 50 birthday we had an amazing time the room,the service was all 5 stars the best meal came from stk service and atmosphere wonderful I was up on the 67 floor in a one bedroom terrace the hotel located right in the middle of the strip get a bus pass and take the duece any where allday up in down the strip. Now the only one downfall was when we checked in which went really quick they asked us for a 750 deposit that we get back we had already paid for the room so thought that was odd but with no charges to room you do get it back all except a 28 dollar aday fee but a wonderful experiece
2 ||| I might be finicky when it comes to Filipino food, but there is one thing that I cannot resist but getting from time to time. I love my Ube and Pan De Ube is one of those items I yearn for. While some of the other items tend to be too sweet for me, I do like the Pan De Sal. A simple breakfast of this bread, fried eggs, and sausage makes me reminisce about my time in the Philippines. \n\nI agree with other Yelpers who say that the items do not tend to last long. Overall, I would recommend to buy enough to eat that day. This is difficult because most of the breads come in a generous amount.
1 ||| Tried it since most reviews were good, but should have listen to the unsatisfied honest reviews, it took 2 agonizing hrs. in line to reach the table which is well set and clean but wait you have to get in line again yes again for the food this time, service was good but after lining up again for food it was just okay not worth the long lines. Sashimi was not that fresh, Todai is better reasonable price & no lines. Oysters were sweet but the shuckers were slackers they were too SLOW on opening up the well liked oysters and they were shucking the tiny oysters not good, crab legs forget about it lacking in taste too low of a quality. I DO NOT recommend to spend 2 hrs in line for a so..so food.
4 ||| The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!
2 ||| went to kings on saturday for an early meal, while out doing the day after xmas shopping!  i have been here a few times for my seafood fix, and time after time the service is very slow, and this visit is the same (at least they are consistent!!)\nstarted the table with the chilled seafood platter for 24.95  comes with 4 dungeness crab legs, 4 oysters, 4 clams and 8 shrimps.  and i think this one of the best deals in vegas for a shellfish platter.\nentrees were grilled shrimp and scallop skewars, kids burger and a combo fried platter.   the fried platter was not to good,  over breaded and gummy shrimp and scallops, and 1 little peice of cod/haddock\ni usually get the sanddabs or something that is on special,  ill stick with that in the future.  but in all actuallity i just come for the shellfsih platter!!!
3 ||| Give me 4 slices of thick -sliced bacon, actually cook my eggs over medium like I ask and have butter coverage all over my toast, you get 4 stars! Really Simple... \n\n\nNah seriously, this is a good breakfast, solid contender. You can get Hash-browns or Home Fries. The Home Fries are always my first choice anywhere and here they get topped with this onion-pepper mixture after -cooking which I am not a big fan of though. So, I ask them to leave it off and then request the potatoes be cooked crisply- about half the time does it come out right, but that is OK, when it actually gets done it makes it a 5 star awesome breakfast! \n\nTook my brother and his family to breakfast and they really liked it. My brother got a 'Joe Bear Scramble' which he liked and was plated so appealingly, the lady at the table next to us saw his and ordered this for herself. SIL got the HUGE Chicken Fried Steak and really liked it, she is finicky so this is good. 7YO Nephew got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (4 pcs) which he liked. But, we had to order him a side of bacon because it does not come with any meat. Hard to justify $10 plus breakfast for a 7year old but oh well, I stole a bacon leaving him 3 pieces which he gobbled up! Suggestion, half the order and add bacon as another option, the pieces are large enough to make this a solid plate for women or kids. \n\nThe interior is on old Denny's and needs to be refreshed soon and parking can get tricky after 9:30am on a Sunday. \n\nSo, if you are in town for NASCAR or Spring Training at Goodyear Ballpark, this location is right off I-10 (Southwest side). Go here or to Mimi's (Northwest side)) for breakfast, but please, stay in Goodyear and keep businesses thriving so I have a job. Thanks :) \n\nTo get 5 stars I would say ramp up the home fries a bit, they are missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe use fresh onion without the bell-peppers (their \"mix\" seems to be pre-made frozen prepped kind) and cook with the potatoes to caramelize versus heaping them on after in a wet mess? Dunno, but probably. \n\nEnjoy!
2 ||| Qdoba is ok. Same idea as Chipotle Grill, but, in my opinion, the food just doesn't taste as good. The burritos don't have that magic ingredient that makes me want to return. And I did not dig the decorating scheme - especially the concrete floors and metal tables. It feels cold and dark, even in the summer.
1 ||| The key word for Fuzzy's is bland. This is some of the most taste-free food I've ever had. Earlier this year I purchased a Groupon worth $10, and on my way home from Art Fair on the Square I decided to stop in. \n\nFuzzy's is inexpensive, so I ordered the taco plate (2 soft shell - chicken and shredded beef, with Mexican rice and fried potatoes for the sides), chips & queso, and a soda to bump me up past the $10 mark. \n\nThe signature of Fuzzy's is their unorthodox toppings - in addition to your standard lettuce/tomato/guac/etc, they include feta cheese and garlic sauce. At least they claim to, anyway. On my tacos there was maybe three little crumbles of feta (which in combination with the other cheese is enough, but not really enough to add any flavor), and I didn't taste any garlic at all. \n\nThe tacos are heaping and meat-heavy, but again - little flavor. I probably could have closed my eyes and not been sure which taco had chicken and which had beef. The rice was okay, and probably the most flavorful thing overall. The fried potatoes had a slightly undercooked generic potato flavor. The chips and queso is ridiculously large - for $3 you get five or six servings of chips and somewhere around 1-1.5 cups of melted cheese. This would be an awesome deal if the queso wasn't so blah. \n\nFuzzy's seems to be going for some sort of Tex-Mex/Mexicali hybrid, and for me it just doesn't work. What little flavor the dishes did have was not a flavor profile I enjoyed. I had hope for Fuzzy's being that it was a Texas chain -  while living in Texas I had plenty of cheap, chain Mexican food that wasn't great but was miles above Taco Bell. I was hoping Fuzzy's would be in the same category, but the only part that reminds me of the food I enjoyed down south was the fact they had Dr. Pepper and Fanta on tap.
2 ||| Ok sports bar, good happy Hour values.  Wings and the usual sports bar food.  Food quality is good but salad and vegetarian choices are limited, but available.  Beer by the pitcher.  Some customers get to loud and use loud foul language which the staff seems to tolerate so be aware if you take the kids.
1 ||| This is certainly an organization that prefers to garner your money via trickery and fine print while they could just as well earn it, along with your respect, with their massages.  I had two very good quality massages but paid over $300 for them.  Within days of an arbitrary deadline my \"membership\" \"expired.  Gone were the two, what I'm sure would have been, very good massages that I thought were coming to me.  While my business sense tells me it would have been smarter to for them to keep a client for the long term, Massage Envy Dobson chose instead to take that short term profit from the technicality.  Given two chances to \"unexpire\" my membership and maintain this otherwise satisfied customer,  they have lost me for good.  Profiting from those \"membership dues\" , unclaimed monthly massages, must make better business sense to Massage Envy than simply offering a quality product for a fair price. \nIf you buy into their program, expect to play into their bet that you too will enjoy some very high priced services. Expect no due process nor leniency.
1 ||| After a much glorified recommendation from the waiter too get the pork c hop special, result was 4 dried out chops, 4 undercooked risottos ( which they replaced with something else, ours were the last they had for the night). After mention of the chops drones, we're told they would melt in mouth, that was not going to happen with those chopsn we were offered free dessert. Took it home, tiramisu, will taste in the AM for breakfast. Disappointing as previous visit was actually quite good. Fifth person had the meatballs, said they were good.\n\nAppetizers muscles were good as was the soup.
0 ||| If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. This is the second time I have left there so unhappy. The first time my Fiance and i went in and got mani's and pedi's. they were rude to both of us and acted like they hated every second of us being there. I THOUGHT it was probably just a fluke and I gave them another shot this afternoon. ... and I wish I hadn't. I only had limited time so i picked my pink color and asked for just a regular manicure. THe girl then proceded to tell me that that the pink wouldn't look good on me. I should just do a french manicure with pink tips.I said no I just want them to be all pink. She said \"It no look good, to much pink for you\" I thought she was joking bc who the hell says that??!! ... but she wasn't. She then told me well its only going to last 2 days with this color. So i said 'Oh is it a bad brand should i pick another brand'? and she said 'no you can do gel manicure'. I again said nope JUST the REGULAR manicure, and she shook her and and said ok but it is going to chip because your nails are so OILY..... WHAT??? AGAIN who says that ... in all my years getting manicures I have never had issues with my nails being to oily for a manicure. This literally went on for like 5 min and I should have just left. The manicure she gave me was TERRIBLE and she was so sloppy with the clipping ( she wacked them off, and the edges were like razor sharp) filing( so uneven, I had to tell her to fix spots)  and the paint job was uneven and lumpy. I literally felt like crying she was just SUCH a b*%&*h and so bad at her job. In all my years I have never NOT tipped and I did not giver her a dime more than the $12 it cost me to have this done to my nails. I just couldn't tip her. It was that bad. \n\nI WILL NEVER EVER GO HERE AGAIn... there are waaaaay to many other places to give your business too in the area.
0 ||| I'll keep this simple - we ordered 2 sampler plates, and all the meats were very dry (brisket, chicken, ribs, and pulled pork).  I could say we were bbq aficionados from Austin to try and make this review more relevant, but when the meat is this dry - it doesn't take a bbq snob to know this place stinks.\n\nI did think the sides were okay (mac and cheese, cheesy potatoes, apple crisp), but we came for bbq.
3 ||| Durants is a great place to go have a nice dinner. Very dark in the dining room... I have eaten here twice. Both times that i was here i had the 18 oz ribeye which i was very happy with. It comes with your choice of garlic mashed, rice, or baked... the mashed were good.  It also came with the choice of soup or salad before the entree. The first time i came here i tried the soup, it was a corn chowder, it was pretty good for a starter.  The second time i was here i got a ceaser salad, ehh.... We also had the strawberry shortcake.... very good... enough for about 4-6 people tho... \n$$$
4 ||| Oh man, oh man! Eldorado is absolutely amazing!! Easily one of the best brunches I've had in Madison.\n\nFirst, let me preface my review by saying that I normally avoid Bloody Marys like the plague. Despite my propensity for alcoholic drinks, it's probably my last possible choice. In fact, I'd probably choose water (ewww) over it.\n\nAnyways, given the massive hype its Bloody Marys have gotten, and by hype, I mean my friends constantly talking about how it's the best thing ever (eye roll)... I decided to give them a chance.\n\nMy Bloody Mary arrived with a sampler of beer (starting things off right already), and was pretty delicious. Of course, it's not the best thing ever like my friends claim, but it was pretty damn good. \n\nThe fact that I highly enjoyed it should say a lot already. It was perfectly spiced, and had enough alcohol to counterbalance the normally overwhelming mix. \n\nFor food, I got their Texas Two Step, which definitely lived up to its name. There's nothing more Texan than two ginormous buttermilk biscuits topped with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, sausage and gravy. I have never had something so delicious, yet so, so terrible for me.\n\nI definitely plan on coming here more often, so who knows, I might even start ordering Bloody Marys elsewhere (yeah right).
2 ||| 1st let me tell you, this is Uncle Bear's Brewhouse Grill. Not Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill! Big difference, menu's are different, the ambiance is different. Just wanted to get that out of the way before I start this thing!\nWife and I was in Tempe to see our Daughter and boyfriend. Brought our little princess with us, daughter said there was an Uncle Bear's nearby! Now Uncle Bear's in well known pet friendly establishment, always a great place for your pooch. Now of course this was on a Saturday night, all of you kids have nothing to do except taking up space! (saying this with a grin) So we had to wait for a table outside, now what I did not like was instead of using the usual led vibrator to let you know your table is ready. They ask for your cell phone so they can text you! That's one way of saving money I guess. \nNow to the food and service. When we finally got seated, we were told since we were on the patio our service was going to be slower? So I asked him why are we second class compare to the dining room! He immediately changed his wording to since there are a lot of people here our service is behind. Since he realized I wasn't going take any crap from him, our service was pretty quick. ;-) \nThe menu was OK a lot different from Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill, I was in the mood for a Crispy Chicken Salad. But they did not offer that there, I also wanted the Jalapeno Poppers appetizer. They again did not offer that there! That's when I realized I had to look at their menu. So I ended up ordering their soft pretzel with cheese and sauce. This was a good thing, pretzel was baked with a butter topping. This was probably the best thing I ate that night. I ordered their slow cooked ribs, I was assuming they were going to be more like a BBQ style ribs. Oops! it was more like a pot roast style. I had their veggie's and mashed potato's with my meal. Overall the good was good, not what I was expecting. Service was OK, and the food was OK. There is a reason why I live in Surprise, to get away from this crowd!
2 ||| As a part of the family reunion, we took a tour of the Motor Speedway. I guess a trip to Charlotte isn't complete without one.  I'm not a NASCAR fan, but when else would I be able to go on the track and it's new and interesting? The price for me was $6, due to Military discount. My niece, who is not even 2, was charged $5. We all piled into the van and headed out to the track. Suddenly, our driver turns off the air so we could hear her! Ah! Too many bodies and too hot for the air not to be on. \n\nThe tour was pretty neat though. Our guide drove us around the track and different areas while she explained the history of the track and how things operate. Then she went on the actual track, which was cool because on TV, the track looks flat, but it's not. She stepped on the gas, and we rode 2 laps around the track. The first time, she drove to the top of the bank, stopped so we could feel , and we were leaning sideways. Then, we all hopped out and took pictures in the winners circle.  The whole this was a pretty awesome experience. I can only imagine what that place is like around race time.
3 ||| This is a fantastic spot for views & a healthy lunch!  Love the Bento boxes...all under 400 calories & delicious!  Keep it up Sanctuary!
0 ||| Couldn't make it to my normal place so I had to try this spot and left very upset. First, the people are very rude they barked at me to sit in one of the pedi chairs except it had no water in it and the tub was damp from the previous customer so I just sat there with my legs to the side for awhile until the girl who was going to do my pedi showed up. She was actually nice but was rather pushy in trying to up-sell me. The girl who did my mani was extremely rude and rough and was rushing through everything like she was on fire. She didn't even file or shape my nails instead she used that machine they use to shape acrylics. When I asked her to clean up my cuticles a little bit more she completely ignored me. At this point I was done and just wanted to finish and leave. I was going to tip the girls in cash and asked them to break my $20, the girl was again super rude and screamed at me asking how much I wanted back. I asked for two $5 and she brought me a $10. Whatever. Overall this place lacks professionalism and I will not be back.
2 ||| Pretty expensive considering the price of one cup of frozen yogurt is the price of a meal at most campus restaurants.\n\nA good variety of things you can add on. \n\nDon't like the bubble tea, far from what I had in chicago chinatown
4 ||| Came in to get my a Fossil watch repaired that belonged to my uncle.  The store owner/watchmaker was very friendly and let me in even though it was 5 minutes to closing time. He took one look at my watch, saw that it was ill-fitting, and proceeded to work his magic. We made pleasant conversation for about fifteen minutes as he adjusted, shined, and set my watch to the proper time. And the best part - he only charged me $5! I offered him $10 for being so thorough and for staying open last his posted hours but he wouldn't accept it. Don't let the pawn shop style sketchness fool you - this is one hole-in-the-wall worth visiting.
1 ||| Marquee, y u so pretentious?!
3 ||| Great variety of flavors!  It's got a clean, modern feel and plenty of room.  There's a half decent choice of toppings, though I personally prefer a broader selection.  I love the \"menu\" on the wall to suggest ways to mix and match flavors and toppings to make yummy treats!  We'll probably return since the location is close and the yogurt flavors were really tasty!
0 ||| Camelback Toyota doesn't have this big, beautiful, new facility on 16th Street, for nothing.  I know I put more than my share of my hard earned money into that building. The last time I left tracks in this garage was after I was up-sold a ton of work that my SUV did not need at the time, to the tune of some nearly $2,000 - when I had gone in for a regular oil change.  The car repair sales associate, Damion, seemed surprised when I requested the replaced parts after they finished all the work he \"recommended\" (scare tactic is more accurate).  One freshly replaced part \"...couldn't be found.\"  (Interesting, in light of the fact that they had just finished it.)  The rest of the parts didn't seem to show enough wear to warrant replacement, in my opinion.  So, I took them around for a couple of other neutral opinions.  Even un-prefaced by explanation, those opinions all concurred with mine.  \n\nI challenged the need for the work performed with Damion, at Camelback Toyota.  And although I didn't press charges in court (but did consider it, just didn't have any extra time to deal with it at the time) - this formerly, quite loyal, customer will surely never return to this \"establishment\" and now they have a really sour review too.   \n\nHowever, I have found solace in my car repair needs at 3A Auto Service in Sunnyslope.  At this well established, family owned business, I am not treated as \"fresh meat\" because I am a woman embarking on an oil change sans a male figure for protection.  To date, they have been honest about the work they have done and have been like a \"husband\" in that they provide a heads up as to what to expect for repairs or maintenance in the next few months.  This could be a grand, auto, love affair!  Rather than an auto affair that cost me grands!!  I give 3A Auto Service a 5 star rating - girls, you gotta go there!
3 ||| oh yeah burger boiee! this place is always a great spot for a yummy burger cooked to perfection. for me, med rare with  some real redness, is only found here and they do it right! not too rare, but definitely very red for the medium and higher temp lovers. i got the standard classic burger with cheddar cheese and i totally forgot to ask for the onions to be grilled, so just lettuce and pickles. this was the best burger i have eaten in a while, and it tastes the same everytime i come back! i did try the sweet potato fries in the mixed basket and  i loved them and the shopping cart they rolled in on. there were 3 of us so we sat at the bar, about 10:30pm on friday and the service was superb! amanda was on task. i had the pear cider and was so enthralled with all the pretty pour toppers, i wanted to try every beer on tap, until i remembered i can't stand the taste of beer that tastes like beer...so there i was with my pear cider, tasting like a pear wine, sitting and starring at the shark, the devil, the animals and all those pretty enticing toppers. it made me feel bold, so i asked for a taste of the white chocolate ale, and yuckie...i was dropped flat down on reality...pooof! i do hate beer that tastes like beer, even if it has a hint of chocolate after taste. next time i come to delux, its all about the dessert menu! i was so full, as usual, that there wasn't room for dessert. but dang nab it! i had to see that there darn menu, and low and behold i couldn't believe my eyes...the delux banana split lava cake will be all mine, next time.
3 ||| Always has great lunch specials.. Back rubs with every meal which was really weird but what the hell never had that at lunch.
1 ||| Unfortunately for me, I had the bad luck of coming here twice in one night.  The first was for a late dinner.  We ordered from the Chinese Menu.  For some reason, all the Chinese food I've ever had in Vegas casinos suck ass.  Even Panda makes better food than this.  We both got two different noodle soups.  They weren't horrible, but they definitely weren't very good.  Both had a salty soup broth that had a slightly odd taste that I cannot describe.  Later that night, around 3 a.m., we had to wait at least fifteen minutes for a table and another half an hour for our food.  You would think they'd know by now to hire more help during the after clubbing hours, but I guess not.  I had the nachos, which were cold and gross.  The chicken noodle soup had no chicken.  Someone ordered biscuits and gravy, which also came cold.  The only plate that was decent was the spam, rice, and eggs bc that one is almost impossible to screw up.  I gave it an extra star for the convenience of being open 24/7 and having a variety items on the menu to choose from (although if they all taste like crap, what is the point?).
1 ||| The Sales clerks at the gun counter are very rude and act as though you are a nuisance if you ask a question. I have had several interactions with different clerks and the culture they have developed in my observation is one that they dont need customers, customers need them.  I really enjoy sportsmans and the products they offer. I sincerely hope that things get better with their staff.
1 ||| I've tried a few of their veg curries, and they're pretty disappointing. They were all seriously lacking in taste and quality. Maybe their non-veg curries are better...\nI understand that since they're so close to campus, they can get away with lower quality food, but still. I wouldn't recommend anyone go there if they're looking for good Indian food.
4 ||| I've found a new addiction. Los Tacos step aside. They have mini tacos, elote, and agua frescas that put Frijoles above the rest. And let's talk about those Frijoles! They get at least 5 stars. The chips, tortillas, red and green salsas are definitely something to talk about. The kind of kick that sticks to your tongue and makes your nose run, but doesn't have you running to the counter asking for leche. Did I mention they have elote? It had the perfect combination of flavors with enough juicy goodness to appreciate the charred kernels. We generally opt for the courtesy cup of water, but we're persuaded to buy an Agua fresca after numerous samples of various concoctions were offered.
2 ||| Wednesday, Girls' day for 4 (two rooms)\n\nReservations-Making reservations = not seamless, took two phone calls and a facebook post to recover the summer deal on the rooms.\n\nCheck-in...this hotel was desolate!  The pools, restaurants, halls, grounds were an expected AZ summertime wasteland.  Yet they stuck us with two rooms with a less-desirable view.  What?  You can't spare a golf course view or an upgrade during your 'off' season?  All four of our room keys failed, for two different doors, nothing like having to phone down and then WAIT!!!\n\nConcierge - left us messages to come see her for a special Starwood gift.  It was an apple shaped cookbook of apple recipes...ummm, I appreciate the thought, but what the heck does this have to do with AZ, Spa retreat, or luxury resort???  She also had unrelenting eye contact.  Very odd experience.\n\nRoom - nice and neat.  Upon one use of toilet (#1 just so you know!), the toilet overflowed, which then had us calling for a handy-man and again another WAIT!!! \n\nSpa - \n+ 30% off services for Phoenix residents on Wednesday!\n+ massage was awesome!!!!\n- small, scratchy spa towels\n- showers aren't the mulit-flow (rainforest) showers like most spas (disappointed with that)\n- hot tub right next to the restrooms, ewww!\n- It took FOREVER for the receptionist to charge 4 massages to one room number...again, another WAIT!!!  \n\nPools...\nAdult Pool\n- Cabana reserved...NO other Cabana's reserved and they gave us the worst one, furthest form the pool.  What????  We moved, of course, but these are LOW rent Cabana's...I know this isn't Vegas, but 4 chairs, a table, a fan, and some iced water for $80??  \n- Bird POOP everywhere...on the chairs, on the umbrella's, on our clothes...ewwwwh!\n- Got 2 Midori margarita's in and they ran out of Midori.  WHAT kind of place is this???  \n+ Coco, the pool guy was awesome!!  Very friendly, searched the grounds to get us another bottle of Midori, and took off the Cabana charge for our trouble.  That is good service!!  We love Coco!!\n\nKids Pool\n+ The good thing was that there were hardly any kids so we could do the slides and lazy river with no trouble.  Don't get me wrong, I like kids, I have 2, but not when it is a girls' day.\n+ Slide was fun.\n- Tons of teens working their summer job...more interested in chatting it up with co-workers or totally uninterested/bored with the whole thing.\n\nHousekeeping...ignored the do not disturb and busted in on us around 9ish then argued with us about it.  So much for sleeping in!\n\nIf this is how it is during the 'off' season, what is it like when this place is hoppin'?  \n\nIt was OK, but did not live up to the hype of a Westin or Scottsdale resort.
2 ||| For me to give this place 3 stars takes complete honesty from me and also shows my disappointment.  I wanted so much to love this place, to crown it, (it wasn't what I thought it was!), to walk out wholly satisfied in the knowledge that I will not have a better steak.  Dining here was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of this Vegas trip, \"remember the time we ate at Delmonico's...\" type thing.  The 3 stars is my confession to myself, this place was not worth the price.\n\nI'm no lover of Cajun food, or spices or anything, and the only thing I know about Emeril is he says \"BAM!\" a lot and the character Elzar on Futurama is a direct parody of him.  I've got no urge to try any more of his food though.  We ate here the evening of the Final Four, had an early reservation and was seated promptly in a fairly quiet room.  Good corner location where we could look out at everything around us but not have people walk by us.  The decor was not of any note... \n\nWe started with the cocktail shrimp with crackers... very odd.  I've been eating a lot of shrimp lately, and there was nothing special about these.  The sauce was a bit spicier than others, so decent.  I pushed my girlfriend to try the kobe...  while I stuck with my old standby of NY.  The bread was nothing special as well.\n\nMy sides were pretty average... I enjoyed my girlfriend's fried scallops though.  The vegetables and potatoes are just complements to the meal though.  The kobe steak came all sliced up and ready to go... It wasn't the mind blowing experience with kobe that I hoped it would be.  I could see the disappointment on my gf's face as she chewed on it.  On the plus side, the kobe sirloin meal came with the sides so thats a few bucks saved.  And sadly, thats the plus side of it.  \n\nMy steak was of a fairly average size, maybe an inch thick, bone-in and perhaps 16 ounces.  I ordered it medium... which the waiter confirmed would be pink throughout.  I waver between medium-rare and medium.. usually if a steak is bone-in I go medium.  Unfortunately, my steak was overcooked.  It got to that bastard style known as medium-well.  I kept hoping as I got closer to the bone it would pinken up, but no such luck.  I ate it happily as it was still a good steak, but I just couldn't shake the disappointment.  The seasoning used on it was decent and had some spice to it but no charm to it.  Part way through my meal I attempted to knife-lift a portion for the gf to try, and wound up dropping it on the table cloth leaving a huge outline of meat.  We laughed about it and both expected our waiter to say something, anything about it as he brushed it with the crumb brush.  Sigh, no such warmth here.  Service was efficient and not quite friendly.  I guess high end steakhouses cater to clients that would rather not have their imperfections pointed out.  One look at me would suggest I'm not the typical client, but no joke came from either our waiter or the assistant waiter.  \n\nAfter we perused the desert menu, I settled on the banana cream pie.  This was the best banana cream pie I've ever had.  It was beautifully presented, had fresh bananas, and was not too sweet.  This was the favorite part of the meal for me.  I doubt I'll ever have a better banana cream pite,  but I'll keep looking.\n\nAll in all, a decent meal but not worth the price.  Meal was ~$200 for 2, no drinks, nothing particularly noteworthy.  I doubt I'll ever go back on my own wallet.
4 ||| The crepes taste so good I had the Nutella crepe with banana and ice cream it was delicious very clean and friendly staff.
0 ||| You would have to be white or be with a white person to get good service around here.  I felt a racial tension when I was here last.
4 ||| This is the best Chipotle in town!! They give the most. If you want Extra chicken they give you EXTRA!! I don't mind paying extra for double meat but some of the Chipotles are so skimpy! They also have the nicest staff Not kidding!!
4 ||| G approved! My food god. This is the best seafood joint around. The crab stone is a must have!!!! Also the seafood fried platter....get it. Wine was great and the service was excellent.\n\nYea...can't go wrong at all. Prepare for a nap afterwards!
4 ||| If you want the perfect breakfast, well this is it.  It's so busy because it's delicious.
3 ||| Big sandwiches.  Big.\n\nBread is great on a good day and fair when they don't have it fresh.\n\nMom loves the Philly cheese-steak.\n\nI like the Italian.  I always ask for hot peppers.\n\nOrdering and paying can be a bit confusing.  Best thing to do is to order and immediately go to the cash register to pay.  Otherwise you have your sandwich, you're hungry and then you have to go pay.  I'm not sure how they don\"t get ripped off.  It would seem to me it would be easy to order, wait, take and leave. \n\nThe chips they offer, name escaping me now, are very good.  I know that at most sandwich places I do not get chips but here I do.  BBQ is my favorite here.
1 ||| My husband and I used to frequent this place whenever we felt like going out to dinner. The pizza isn't the best in town, but we were fond of the service and neighborhood-y atmosphere (friendly, casual). The last 4 times we've been there over the past few months, the service has been actually awful. \n\nOnce we had a new waitress, who said it was her first day as a waitress, for which I felt bad because...why wasn't anyone training her?! Last time, the waitress was actually rude, and barely checked on us, even though we would have ordered more if she had. Her loss, Pino's loss.\n\nUsed to feel like an old friend. Sadly, no more. Not sure we'll ever go back, because you want to feel welcome when you frequent a place.\n\nIf you do go, I recommend a plain cheese or quattro fromaggi pizza or the lasagna, which is often on special. \n\nOh, they used to serve budweiser (regular, not light) in frosted glasses, and there was something old fashioned and delicious in it, but they don't seem to do that anymore either. \n\nThere is also one great Italian waiter, but we never get him anymore. I guess we're not good enough to get real waiters?? Ha.
2 ||| It's a sandwich shop modeled on Subway, better than Subway, but it's still just a sandwich shop with deli-meat laden subs, wraps, fold em's and salads; no sides except chips; and cheap combo prices.  Filling and a good value, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe donut shop thingie encroaching on the dining area is just a bit odd.  Expensive little donuts.  How cool.
2 ||| They are a tire shop, they always seem busy, but are usually able to get you in.\n\nWent here when my car had a flat, sidewall damage so it was unrepairable, they got me a new tire at a fair price (other places were cheaper, but I was in a hurry and they are close to my house.\n\nProbably won't be my go to tire guys, but they're there for any emergencies
0 ||| Went for lunch and we all ordered Carne asada burrito. Food was plain and overpriced for what you get.
0 ||| i well never come back  in place at all its very dirty  no hot water we payed for 3days in  we ask if  they can gave as back the money we payed for its trou online  in in they was very roods in nasty  about its  im telling you the place its was suck  i never have that bad s here we stupid we do we payed  $200.00a day for 3 days  the bad thing about its we meet my family there in we payed for 3 rooms in we are not so happy wint we got are room so my family bed was very filthy bath room to no hot water i my family if they have something that we have in are room wel they have worse than we got  so to all you people if think going to the place dont  its suck
4 ||| This place is like a The Vitamin World on steroids with a smoothie bar attached. I go for the alkaline water because they have 10.5 ph balanced water for $2 a gallon. The alkaline water helps keep my blood sugar levels lower because most diabetics (like myself) have an acidic body. Alkaline water & exercise is saving my life!
2 ||| i was craving the frozen hot chocolate...it was monstrous! it was pretty good tho not quite how i remember it from new york...\n\nwe had ordered a bunch of other things like the nachos, a burger, the hotdog. everything was pretty good - but not sure if it is quite worth the hefty price tag for diner type food (ok, it's a bit fancier than diner food).\nwish we had some room for dessert - we decided next time, to just go for dessert.\n\nservice was just okay. a bit slow and we needed to flag down our waiter a couple of times. they do take harris' comps - so that was a plus.
0 ||| Sorry but I have a different opinion. They give you mostly hard meat. Not real meat and it's not worth the price
4 ||| I wanted to take off a star for the weird bendy line that I always have to wait in when I go through the drive thru. However, the truth is that if I simply parked my car and walked my lazy a** inside, I would not have to wait.\n\nSpeaking of their drive thru, wow. You could be in a line all the way out to Eastern and you would be through that line in 5 minutes. They really have an operation going on there. This is what happens when you have the budget to hire sufficient amounts of employees.\n\nOne time this one girl was kinda mean to me...but I can't blame McDonalds.  It felt like an anger caused by something such as a breakup or a stressful issue with not paying rent, so I let it go.\n\nHAVE YOU HAD THEIR FRIES?!?!!?  I don't care what people say. I think are putting crack in those. Salt and crack. If one day down the line we find out that McDonalds fries were so good because they were laced with something, I won't be shocked.
3 ||| We came to St Francis early for brunch and had a very nice time.\n\nSt Francis is about the food and the ambiance.  It's one of those restaurants that you wish you lived closer to, so you could become a regular.  The service is friendly and the wait staff has a effusive manner.\n\nWe ordered the Eggs Benedict with the standard english muffins and hollandaise sauce, skipped the potatoes for $13.00, along with the Farmer's Frittata for $10.00.  Both were very good.  The Frittata's taste lingered well after our meal, but in a good way.  It was light and had a nice mixture of flavors.\n\nAll the food came promptly and we had time to sit back and enjoy our meal.  It also gave us an opportunity to  browse the efforts of the interior designer and architect on the space.  I think I would call it light and breezy, as was our meal.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n.
0 ||| We arrived a little after 3pm with a group of 20, including 16 with Special Needs.  No line, plenty of empty tables and we gave our Groupons and had to pay $2.49 per person extra ( tax?).  They wanted us to pay $100 for gratuity to sit together in the same EMPTY area; another union rule.   More later on that.  I said no problem, we aren't moving since we were already seated, but told them they just lost any additional tip we were planning on leaving above the $100.  This is union policy, I was told again.  Well, keep your union policies.   Those are the workers the union protects..  Good for the union.  The service was awful, the food was just as bad and I would never recommend this place to anybody who has any food taste/class.   As soon as we finished, I had two vomit ( un- sweetened tea must have been off temperature).   None of us ate more than a bit of anything.  Most items weren't labeled so the one with a seafood allergy, ended up with seafood in the pasta.   Not labeled.   Chicken Noodle Soup isn't a selection of soup.  It was the only choice.   Desserts were just awful.   The best was the Ice Cream and it can from a machine.   Don't go,  not recommended; rather stay hungry than eat this rubbish.  Service was terrible, but then again, unions only hire the best workers...wrong...least motivated.... yes!   Fool me once...Never again.
2 ||| Used to be my go-to sushi joint for happy hour... That is, until I discovered Soho. There's nothing wrong with 808. It's just that, compared to Soho, there's no reason to go back to 808..
3 ||| The cocktail waitresses are always awesome.  Food is really good in the Cafe (great hamburgers).  Service in Cafe is sometimes hit or miss, but the hostess/cashiers are always friendly and helpful. The cashiers and wait staff in the buffet also do a great job and are always friendly.  Gambling is, of course, hit or miss (like any casino).  I like this local place.
4 ||| It feels senseless attempting to use written words to portray the three-day nirvana that was EDC 2012...but here goes nothing!\n\nEDC 2012 was my third EDC.This year, I arrived in Las Vegas with two goals: the first, to not end up separated from my crew (which I somehow managed to do not once, not twice, but on all three days of EDC 2011)...and the second, to dive in to EDC headfirst and finish the weekend with no regrets... \n\nBoth of these goals were accomplished by leaps and bounds, despite the fact that EDC required my friends and I to bust more missions than I ever considered myself capable of (thanks in no small part to a wallet/EDC ticket/ID/credit card that was stolen on the dancefloor, our befriending of a lovely Canadian girl who had arrived in Las Vegas with nowhere to stay for the weekend, one friend's parents threatening the disownment of their daughter, and a host of other situations that brought my friends and I closer together than ever before). For the weekend to have turned out to be such a RESOUNDING success despite the onset of one shitshow setback after another shows how truly special and amazing of an event EDC is. Anyways, here are my highlights:\n\n- Dusk 'til dawn! EDC's most unique characteristic is the festival's \"sunset to sunrise\" format, which demands as much as your body and your willpower are willing to put out - you'll find yourself with a reversed body clock by the end of the third day. Go for the three-day stretch - you'll find yourself with a newfound appreciation for yourself and the limits of your body.\n\n- The talent! Insomniac spared no expense in assembling a world-class lineup of DJs for EDC 2012. In a span of three days, I was able to see Steve Angello, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Knife Party, and a whole host of the best that electronic/dance music has to offer. Every DJ who played at EDC brought their A-game, throwing down banger after banger and keepin' the party rockin'. I will never forget screaming \"This IS Paradise\" at the top of my lungs while seeing Fedde Le Grand bring in sunrise with his tune of the same name...nor will I forget hitching a ride atop a VIP cart in the heart of the crowd during David Guetta's \"Without You\", waving out to a sea of people, all of whom were cheering right back at my friends and I.\n\n- The production value, stage designs and lighting effects that were nothing short of world class...\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6NG_A-epYEpsJSugfAaTRQ?select=oKal-wTRBxCJjWzIhcaXig#6sN5BGLpzMnJjYIcjSyt_w\n\nEDC fully displays Insomniac's credo - \"it's all about the experience.\" The Kinetic Field - although not as jaw-dropping as last year's office building-sized structure, was \"hollow\", in that festival goers were now able to view sunrise through the stage itself. Equally breathtaking were the visual displays accompanying each DJ set; oozing neon colors and trippy illustrations came straight out of (the best kind of) an acid trip. I witnessed dozens of acrobats, costumed performers, fire dancers , and the ever-popular Mirror Man grace EDC with their talents; no details were overlooked in terms of the event's aesthetics. For example, the Red Bull Skydivers glided down to earth, shooting sparks each night...legit.\n\nOH, and I haven't even gotten to the fireworks yet. It looks like EDC has prematurely spoiled my 4th of July...\n\n- The sense of togetherness found within the crowds at EDC is unlike that of any other event. Because EDC calls for a serious investment of time, money, and energy, there's a filter effect that takes place. Obnoxious assholes and creepy hoodie-wearing tweakers are very much the minority at EDCLV (unlike most massive events held within the SoCal area), and I can speak from experience in saying that the overwhelming majority of the people that I met at EDC were fun-loving partygoers who were very polite (making way for your chain of head-bobbing friends as you navigate a crowd), down-to-earth, and friendly. \n\nThis same sense of good-natured behavior was emphasized by the Speedway staff and the Las Vegas Metro PD; when my friend lost his wallet, the police officers whom we asked for help were very much courteous (albeit powerless, as no definite lost & found had been set up...lovely). Did I mention that we hitchhiked our way back to the strip with some awesome Good Samiritan ravers on the first night (due to aforementioned stolen wallet)? EDC gives me faith in the good nature of human beings.\n\nI could go on and on, but really you'd have to experience EDC for yourself to fully know just how inspiring and life-changing of an event this is. I didn't really touch on the cons of EDC 2012 (god-awful traffic to/from the Speedway, inept organization with regards to the lost & found, a lack of food options to choose from, Mother Nature giving Saturday night the middle finger), but frankly, that's because all negativity had been erased from my mind for the weekend. For three days, EDC enabled my friends and I to touch the sky!
0 ||| Food was a 4, but the service from Teasha was a little bit sideways (literally) she did not walk past the corner of the table.  I don't think she smiled once.  We were sbout to leave based on her bad attitude.  The gentleman that brought our food was more attentive than Teasha was.  So a bit of advice, if she comes to your table, leave or ask to be seated in another servers section, trust me..
3 ||| ***This review based on happy hour only.\n\nI'm excited about this place.  While I was slightly disappointed in the complete lack of happy hour drink or food specials (how can you refuse to acknowledge happy hour??), by the time I left, I was still a fan.  My optimistic potential viewpoint is based on these 2 unique factors:\n\n1) amazing rooftop bar.  Seriously.  We were up there at about 8:30pm on a 102-degree day, and it was honestly comfortable!  I had been skeptical that we'd be able to make it, but between the misters and canvas \"retractable ceiling tiles,\" it was a pleasant way to view an amazing sunset over Camelback and Squaw Peak.  This view is fantastic and I am glad that Del Frisco's is taking full advantage of it.  This rooftop is simply cool, and made me feel like I was in a real, proper city!\n2) complimentary valet.  But even better than just the complimentary valet right in front of the restaurant, the valet also has an option where you can text them 10 minutes before you're ready to go, and your car will be pulled up when you walk out.  This makes this place a very convenient place to meet up without having to deal with parking!\n\nThe cocktails and wine list were pretty standard, and we had a flatbread pizza that was really yummy.  But it was the rooftop bar and valet that will make me come back -- and next time, stay for dinner.
2 ||| This place was not what I expected.  It is a huge open space with a large bar stuck right in the middle.  The menu is more upscale than the usual sports 'bar' selections, but I guess that is the difference between sports bar and sports grill?\n\nThe food was good, but if I remember correctly they had little to no draft beer.  They could have had Bud or Coors or something, but to me that translates to no beer on tap.  \n\nThey have a lot of flat screen tvs as they should,  but I like a little bit more character in my sports bar.  This is much too commercial for my taste.
0 ||| I stayed two night in Vdara, and I had a unpleasant experience here. The first day we checked in Vdara, I took a nap on the bed. After a while, I felt one of my leg was itchy and I lifted the quilt, and found there were some black spots peppered on the sheet. I was shocked, because I didn't expected the hotel like Vdara would make such mistake. I called the housing keeping instantly and asked for changing the sheet. Then I asked the manager to come as well, the African American manager took a picture and said he would report it, and would compensate us for that. Yet, two days latter, I still didn't hear back from Vdara. :( It seems like Vdara is not value about customer experience. not recommended.
3 ||| I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts. You can hang out there in some small seating areas, and even order food. Worth it just to come in and look around even if you dont need anything!
0 ||| The only reason I gave it 1 star was because the waitress was excellent and caring.\nThis was my first time eating at a Logan's, and it will be my last.\nThe rolls were brought to our table and the first bite I took I broke a molar on something hard that was in it. When I spit it out it looked like a large piece of coal or something charred. I had bitten down on it and it cause my molar to actually crack. The pain was horrible, and because of it, I was unable to eat the steak I had ordered.\nThe waitress went to the manager, who promptly came out, and without any apology or the remotest sign of concern, requested my name, address, and phone number, to turn over to corporate. No offer of a discount, no further concern for how the pain I was in or the fact that I could not eat the steak I had ordered. I still was not concerned, and was willing to give them a chance. UNTIL, corporate called me. I was unable to take the call when they phoned me the next day, but I did call back to the number that was left in the voice mail, that day and every day since, several times a day. The person who had phoned me was from their loss prevention, Tanya Etheridge, and she has not returned my call since, nor does she answer her phone when I call. \nI will have to pay the dental bill for this, and have been in pain since this occurred and I did not even receive the courtesy of concern or a call back. The managers only concern was the possibility that I might be a sue happy person, that was why she wanted to get my information to corporate as soon as possible.
4 ||| Beautiful lit scenery using wire and colorful silk amazed us as we walked through the scenery.  Very impressive.   See my pictures!\n\nIf you are in Montreal, this is a must see ... check dates and times as it is a yearly temporary event.
0 ||| I always get a weird feeling inside and can't wait to get out. I feel sort of claustrophobic and uncomfortable that I could never even imagine dining there. In fact, it's one of the most uninviting places I have ever been in.  I think the dark and poor layout contributes to a bad flow to the place. \n\nPeople walk in and don't know what to do or where to pay without guidance from the employees.  I think the employees figure if you were able to find the place then you have been there before.  If you are new to Go Raw Cafe--just head to the cramped area in the back near the bathroom to place your order.\n\nI always wonder if they are still gonna be in business when I drive up.  After looking around my last visit I asked myself why not just get a juice at Whole Foods 5 minutes away??  I made up my mind and I am officially all done with Go Raw Cafe.  \n\nThey recently put a rack of vitamins in front of the stainless steel bar area which seems so large and out of place.  They also moved the cash register around the corner which is awkward.  It's beginning to feel really cluttered even though there is plenty of space to work with.  They have it laid out horribly.  I used to enjoy my juice outside by the lake but the chairs are always missing and the outdoor trash can is usually over flowing.\n\nI usually get the spicy veggie cocktail, whatever my boyfriend wants, and 2 coconut waters or to-go. The girls have no personality and border on rude...definitely not friendly not matter what day of the week or what worker you get...it's actually kind of strange?  I guess if I was crammed into the back of that cafe to work all day I would be unhappy too.\n\nGO RAW is hidden...with gem potential if they would just hire someone to redesign the layout.  The bar stools at the stainless counter were the only place I ever saw people sitting and that option is gone now.   You can't get a good vantage point on the menu from the small area that is left to place your order from.  If it's busy you can't watch them make your juice because you are in the way....unless you want to peek through the shelves of vitamins.  \n\nThis place is a wreck and I have seen better use of space in a food truck.  (The photo shows the menu from where you order and the rack I am speaking of is off to the left.)\n\nDear Owner: Improvements to the inside are beyond needed...at the very least, move that rack.  If you get really CRAZY with renovations the wall near the lake should be all WINDOWS....corner to corner windows...you are a cafe on the water with one of the BEST views in Vegas.  Your space has the greatest potential and you are wasting it.  Your rude and grouchy employees are also hurting your business.
0 ||| The first time we had My Mother's Restaurant was months ago. My husband and I were feeling homesick, and being from Illinois we got excited when we saw that My Mother's Restaurant had deep dish \"Chicago Style.\" It was such a lie and a huge let down. The pizza was not deep dish,  it was not \"Chicago Style,\" rather it was thick crust. It was so thick that we could not taste the topping, just the crust. \n---------------------\nLast night we decided to give this place another try since our favorite pizza restaurant was closed. After being on hold for almost 10 minutes right off the get go (which was no big deal since they were busy), my husband finally got to talk to someone. He had to repeat the pizza topping order twice, and the buffalo wings four times. They told us 35-45 mins since they were busy. \n\nWhen the delivery finally came, we were starving and I was really looking forward to their wings (I had been craving buffalo wings for weeks now).  The pizza was okay, the topping were correct but the dough was a little on the dry side. Now for the wings I had been craving, that came with a side of ranch and celery. They sent us the wrong one. They sent BBQ, and not the buffalo that we wanted, even after my husband repeated himself four times. \n\nI've heard that their other food is great but after last night's dinner being such a failure, we will never be ordering from this restaurant again. We've been disappointed with them twice now. \n\nWe like to support local restaurants, we won't be supporting this one.
3 ||| Just tried Next Door Brewing Co.on a week night last week. The ambiance is great, hard wood floors, smaller but nice bar and a windowed off area where you can see the brewing equipment. Not sure if they are still figuring out staffing, but our service was incredibly slow. The staff was nice but we waited a long time to even have someone come over with waters and take our order. I had the white chicken chili which was on special that day and it was great! The portion size was huge, especially considering the low price I paid for it. Will definitely come back on a weekend and try some of their drinks.
1 ||| This place is worthless if you need immediate care during the day!!! My kitty has chronic UTIs that can lead to severe and life threatening blockages. On several occasions they have done little or nothing to accommodate him during such instances....stating that they are booked and that I should visit an emergency vet. Well then why am I paying you monthly if you can never see my pet when he needs to be seen? I was told \"you do know this is a wellness clinic?\" So, apparently sick pets are not a priority for them. The Desert Ridge location is FAR better about getting him in...even when they are full, they squeeze him in between patients. It is a shame, because I really like Dr. Cherico. Furthermore, the techs are not very skilled in handling feisty pets. My other cat does not like coming to the vet, at all, and often becomes very agitated. One instance the techs left me in the room for 20 minutes to try and get my hissing, spitting, and scratching cat in her crate by myself. During a subsequent teeth cleaning she was allowed to scratch herself in her own eye leading to an eye infection that became an ear infection as well. It was awful. I do not recommend the 90th location at all!!!
1 ||| Probably the lamest happy hour spot I've ever been to. We asked the bartender about that day's HA items (we were there on a Friday) and he listed 3 items - 2 specific foo-foo drinks(probably colored blue) and one appetizer. wow. \n\nNothing here like a happy hour menu or discounted well drinks. \n\nSo we got a vodka and soda - $13.  oooookay, I guess they're preying on the people who don't have enough sense to go to a theatre (Ipic) that's less than $20/head. \n\nI was there for a meetup, which brought people there to have fun, etc. You'd think Tanzy would appreciate that, but they had their waitresses add 20% to everyone's bill - nice. It's not like we were sitting down creating a 'table from hell with 30 people\".\n\nLuckily I was impatient enough to get our drinks at the bar, so this didn't affect me.\n\nEveryone from the people at the door , the bartenders, and the waitresses were super nice, though. \n\nThe bathroom was pretty cool..\n\nOh and last but not least, I have to admit I absolutely hate the name , Tanzy. I just feel creepy as a hetero male saying \"hey, I'm going to Tanzy\". \n\nPlease note my utter hatred of the name didn't affect this review.
2 ||| Napa location is on a different level compared to Vegas. The food and service at the bar were both a little rough. Our server/bartender completely forgot about us several times and we had to reorder a few times as well. In addition, I overheard the bartender blame the chef for an error in food to a customer. I thought that was very unprofessional. Quality of the food did not seem up to par from my previous experiences in Napa.
0 ||| Unbelievable. How the heck do you run out of crushed peppers and parmesan cheese?\n\nI should've run back in and grabbed a whole roll of those Bounty-like paper towels. Would've served them right.
3 ||| It's about time Summerlin had a decent pub/bar/hang-out/tavern, whatever the hell you want to call it, it's good they have one. \nSuper friendly staff, not overbearingly so, but attentive. Food was quite tasty, chicken sandwich is da bomb! The waitress said you can get it as a wrap (off the menu) , nice tip, thanks.\nFew things:\n1) For yelpers, if you check in you get a free shot of their house whisky. Bad thing is, it's horrible. Cinnamon / orange infused. Pretty much tasted like Triaminic cold and cough. Pass on it, trust me.\n2) The bathroom sinks...I can't stand these things. Whoever thought a slightly tilted slab of tile would work as a sink...dude, you were waaaay wrong. Give me a basin and save my clothing from the splash back and the whopping 2 inches of space to place my hands under, please. \n\nBottom line: Great place to hang, plenty of room to move, cool staff, great food. Just beware of the bathroom sinks....
3 ||| Greeted and sat right away! Served hot sliced bread w/ olive oil heated in a panini press - good! Service good! No recommendations or anything, was offered dessert. I had the herb crusted / kale salad very good! \nI think would be a great evening place for an Italian date night!
3 ||| Please keep this place alive. Quick, easy, delicious - it's the American way.
3 ||| I haven't been to too many outlet malls but this one is probably the best out of all of them. It's an outdoor mall and it's not too small or extremely large. It's also pretty easy to navigate once you make a few rounds; I think it pretty much loops around in a complete circle. When we went it was moderately crowded but still able to navigate freely, and it was on a Tuesday afternoon. Parking was okay, although we got kinda lost initially since this was our first time here. They have a 4 story (?) parking deck right next to the mall.\n\nThey have plenty of stores ranging for MK to Pacsun to Charlotte Russe and everything in between. I was able to find some good deals at GAP and O'Nelil but unfortunately my gf couldn't find anything :(\n\nThe ratio of higher end/designer stores to your typical chain dept. store was like 10 to 3 so if you're more into that fancy stuff, then this place has many options. There were plenty of good deals going on when we went as well.\n\nThe only downside is their limited food options.. we ended up just getting an Auntie Annes pretzel that seemed like it was sitting out for a bit..
3 ||| I went with my wife a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived not knowing what we wanted to see.  Noticed that Bridesmaids was scheduled at 9:25 and decided to see it even though it was only 8:50.  We walked around a bit in the shopping center across the street, and came back.  The lady said the theater was ready yet so we sat and read for a bit until I noticed it was 9:25, so we went in to the theater only to discover the movie was playing!  but it quickly became apparent that it wasn't the beginning but  rather the end!\n\nTurns out that the sign was wrong outside (i double checked to see what it said) and that it was a 9:55 movie not 9:25.  Needless to say we were a bit annoyed to wait another half hour for the movie.  However, the manager came over and offered to refund our tickets, which I thought was a very nice gesture given the screw-up.   It definitely is a move that will make me come back again to this theater.\n\nVery cool vintage 50's facade, and an interesting mix of independent and main-stream cinema.  I like it.  And who cares about the seats anyway.  They might be old, but I was never uncomfortable.
4 ||| I come here often for lunch and dinner, and love all the vegan options. The Crazy Pita salad and Mediterranean Salad are both great, and their hummus with whole wheat pita is delish. Crazy Pita is great!
2 ||| i loveeeeeeeeeeeeee sanrio. specifically badtz-maru!! but there was no badtz-maru to be found at this sanrio store T_____T\n\nthe selection at this store was alright-- lots of hello kitty things. they didn't have much variety with any of the other characters, though. \n\nthe girls behind the counter were very friendly and accommodating.\n\ni think i was just really disappointed that i couldn't find anything that had badtz-maru on it.\n\nhopefully they'll bring in more variety next time! hello kittly will do for now ^___^
0 ||| Rude bartenders, rude busboys, poor production. The nicest person in the joint was Johnny at the front door when he refunded my door charge because of the miserable experience there.\n\nMy friend was able to coordinate with management about getting us in the VIP short line and a discount for the guys (ladies were free). Still had to pay $20 to get in, and the prestige of the Bellagio did not carry inside this club.\n\nFirst it was too dark in there. How can you set up a club for a ton of hot ladies in there if I can't see them? Even security had to shine their flashlights on all the steps everytime you walked by. Even the lights on the dance floor made it hard to tell if the girl 5 feet away was actually a 9 or just caked in makeup.\n\nFound an empty spot at the bar, couldn't find a bottle list to see what scotch they had. Bartender walks over, I ask her what type of scotch they have since I can't see their bottles in the dark. She drops her jaw and rudely says, \"I have 50 types. What do you want?\" No offer of a menu, no suggestions, even my friend behind me said wow, what B*t$h. Alison, so it says on my receipt, did not get a tip for that overpriced 12-year drink. Maybe I caught this particular bartender on a bad night, but if I'm paying $20 or $30 just to be in there you had better offer some degree of service.\n\nThe busboys or servers or whatever those little guys in vests do literally sprint down hallways and push people out of their way. There is a bottle service delivery system that uses some weird blue diamond chariot thing carried by two guys and two girls with sparklers. There were no tables or extra dance areas, only two poorly lit go-go dancers. Overall, this club was not a positive experience.\n\nWhen we left after only 20 or 30 minutes, I asked to go back to the cashier but one of the eight suits coordinating door entry listened to my recap and refunded my money. That was the best part of my experience there.\n\nThe prestige of being in the Bellagio does not warrant a $30 entrance fee to the Bank.
1 ||| I was in Las Vegas for a conference last week and they had a block of rooms at the Excalibur for $69. Pretty cheap. \n\nI stayed Sun and Monday night... probably 2 of the slowest days in Las Vegas. Everything seems to smell like smoke. Lines to check in AND check out were long. The rooms are \"ok\", but the carpets look like they need to be ripped up and replaced.... they were pretty gross. The hallways seem to be a little newer than the rooms. The furniture is very dated, but they do have big flat screen tvs. I would definitely suggest bringing slippers to wear around your room and/or flip flops to wear in the shower. \n\nThe service was ok. The people working at the desk were polite. The concierge desk was a little rude. Also, I called for a wake-up call and they never called me. \n\nI defintely would not go back to the Excalibur. I'd rather pay more money for a better experience.
4 ||| Happy hour prices (half off drinks and apps under $10, plus a $6 sushi roll) combined with a warm atmosphere make this a Lawrenceville gem. Food is unique and delicious without being pretentious. Guac is a favorite. The management here is also FANTASTIC. Frequent about twice a month and they are extremely accommodating, even on busy nights. Will do their best to fit you in and work with your party. We take out of town guests here and they're always impressed. Wish we could go more!
1 ||| We were hungry and everything else was closed near our gate (except Wendy's, which doesn't count as food in my book), so we ate some chips, salsa, and guacamole here.  My expectations were low, so I wasn't surprised to be unimpressed.\nThe chips came in three colors - Yellow #5, Blue #1, and natural corn color.  The salsa was completely pureed - no chunks at all.  It was more like hot sauce.  Ugh.  The guacamole was pretty flavorless.  This is not my kind of food.\nThe service and atmosphere were quite nice for an airport, however.
0 ||| Very unhappy with this place. \nI ordered some insoles for my allegria shoes two weeks ago. \nI called last week to see if they were in but the person didn't bother to want my information and I was told that the product was not in. \nI waited another week to see if somehow they would call but had to go in and ask for my order. \nThey sure did collect my money but the order was never placed. \nThe lady was very nice but I have needed this insoles since I have pain on my feet without them.
4 ||| This is my favorite sushi joint!  The atmosphere is relaxed and fun.  Sitting at the sushi bar, there is always something new.  You might even get a free surprise from one of the chefs.  Yum!  They have a \"frequent buyer\" program, and when you turn in your little Sumo card after you eat they will give you a credit on it.  When my credit gets high enough I turn it in for a meal on the house!  Free food-what could be better? The plum wine is sweet and the fish is fresh.  Even green tea mochi to finish the meal.  This is top-notch stuff!
1 ||| Service was decent enough. When the waiter brought bread we laughed because it was a tiny tiny amount (five pieces, plus some awkward cut sides) for six people. 1.5 in squares of what I believe was supposed to be focaccia. No FLAVOR.\n\nI had the Sea Bake Starter. It was supposed to be shrimp, bay scallops, and crawfish, in some sort of creamy cheese sauce. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. There was shrimp and a couple of tiny pieces of crawfish. The sauce was watery, and the whole dish lacked flavor. Totally blah.\n\nThere was also a chicken quesadilla. Yet again. No flavor to it. \n\nOverall, nothing great at all and wouldn't recommend at this point.
4 ||| I been coming here since I was a kid and I love it!\nI could never get sick of this pizza.\nSomething magical about the sauce they use, and the crust is very original.\n\nI now live in California and I rarely get a chance to enjoy Barros.  I have yet to find a pizza place in California that compares.\n\nBarros come to Southern California please!!!!
0 ||| Absolute worst experience I have had living in an apartment, the staff is super rude and always trying to make an extra dollar off of you any way they can, the place itself is ghetto and not kept very clean, with a dirty vagrant vibe to all of the residents. Always had the feeling like I was going to get mugged walking around outside. Please avoid this place at all costs, they try to lure you in with the promise of good deals but you will for sure pay for it in the end.
2 ||| I'm giving it 3 stars because I have hope. Since \"The Daily Grind\" closed I have been looking for a replacement for my occasional coffee/chai stop. I'm not one to resort to one of the BIG name shops. I prefer supporting the more local ventures. So I stopped in on my walk in to work the other morning. It was empty but I was eagerly greeted as I made my way to the counter. I ordered the large Americano, and waited. As I waited I enjoyed the simplicity of the shop. I didn't see any sweets or treats to go with my java, and then I look down to notice that the espresso machine had a part being held up by a plastic cup that had crushed under the weight of this part and water was dripping on the counter. And I continued to wait. No one was before me and no one right after... \nI finally got my coffee and went on my way. Served very hot, as far as the flavor, ehh the jury is still out. \nSeveral of my coworkers have also tried to give these guys a chance but they have commented on how long it takes to just get a regular cup o'joe. A few of my coworkers have also complained about the sizes offered (the small is pretty small and the large is only medium at the other places). They then are willing to wait in the long line at one of the BIG names. \nAgain I have hope! I will give them at least 3 if not 4 tries...and we shall see...I would like to see them succeed.
4 ||| You definitely haven't experienced Vegas to the fullest if you leave without seeing Cirque du Soleil's O show!!! I got lucky during my visits cus my parent's were able to get me complimentary tickets not once but twice to experience this breath taking, phenomenal show. I'd seriously pay if i had to cus it is seriously just... O-mazing. O-tastic. Ridiculous! If you're a Cirque fan, this is a must. I'm not going to go into any details but throughout the show, there's so much going on! Just how I like it, everything felt so spontaneous and even overwhelming (cus so much was going on at once) but it was seriously... elaborately and beautifully put together.\n\nMy first experience there, we sat in the very front row and we definitely got a bit wet... but i didnt care cus the show seriously just kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole night! (show lasted about ... less than 2 hours) but second time around... lesson learned. If you sit behind row D... you'll be safe and dry and the experience is just as spectacular! I definitely want to experience the show from the balcony seats one day though (FYI: heard it's actually less expensive AND you get the whole view of the stage!!!).\n\nSeriously, do yourself the most memorable favor by treating yourself to enjoy this show. warning: it will sweep you off your feet =)
3 ||| Get extra bowls or a to-go container you wil need them. \n\nHUGE portions which scores points for me always. The food is great too. No, it's not authentic, but if you're just looking for some feel-good food come here. Portions are huge which is why it costs a bit (up to nine bucks after tax) but their best item is actuallt their cheapest the plain udon at under seven bucks after tax. \n\nTheir udon noodles are super thick you won't miss the meat. I have very Americanized tase buds I'll admit, but to me the broth is super tasty. I put in a cup of chili oil and it's bliss in a bowl. \n\nAlso gets points for atmosphere very clean, for just a few dollarsmore than fast food it's actually a place you can enjoy sitting in and spending time.
3 ||| Chima is an excellent place to go for a night of protein gluttony. This is a classic churrascaria where gauchos walk around with various meats. They offer various cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and even fish. They also have an extensive salad bar with antipasti and such. I really enjoyed the prosciutto and cantaloupe as well as the fresh mozzarella with tomatoes. \n\nAs with most Brazilian steakhouses, this place is pricey but it's worth it as a treat every now and then. It's located in the heart of Charlotte so it's easier to use their valet service for your vehicle. The service is excellent all around here so if you have a special occasion to celebrate with a meat lover, this is the place to be.
1 ||| Supremely sticky floors. I sat on a bar stool and leaped over the puddles to avoid ruining my shoes.\n\nAccidentally mistook my friend Jason from far away and when I said, \"hey Jason,\" this shady dude said, \"I'm not Jason, but I'll certainly be him.\" Eeew.
4 ||| Always great to be back. It's a lot like eating at a Moroccan friend's house with a kick ass personal chef.
1 ||| Anyone who knows me - and that's you, buddy - know I (used to) love Panda Express. Enough to keep menus up at my desk at work to advertise. Note: they are coming down tomorrow. Yeah, I've been lazy up to this point, but now that this is in print, I gotta keep up with my obligations.\n\nI just can't take it anymore. The prices increase with...every...single...visit. As does the wait in the drive thru. My first experience with both the price gouging and the 8 minute wait through the drive thru (God, I'd pray for 8 minutes now) I thought: \"Well, the food is still great and this might be a one-time occurrence.\"\n\nBut, just in case, on the next visit, I timed the experience - clocked at 12 minutes - and I almost asked for a discount, you know, to bring back the price to the previous visit. My reasoning for the markdown? Duh, gas prices have increased.\n\nI'm not dumb or ignorant enough not to know the two are intertwined, but like a lot of other Americans, I will be finding another place to spend my money for a better value. Panda has done NOTHING to convince me to return. Well, aside from the cuddly bears in their marketing. Okay, okay, I kinda like those talking pandas, but it's not working.\n\nStill, I rate Panda Express 2/5 stars because I still love their food. I can't find Beijing Beef anywhere else and that's my favorite. Also, their \"Chow Mein\" - by the way, guys, that's more like LO MEIN, but still - is good as is their Orange Chicken (though I've had much better at a Chinese Buffet.) Unfortunately, you'll have to pay an extra dollar for shrimp items, and take my word for it: it's not worth it. I'd barely order them at the same price.\n\nLesson? Don't choose the Drive Thru, save up for your yearly visit there - as I will, but can a restaurant stay open if that's the case? - and prepare for a long wait if you don't go inside. It's about the same amount of time as if you went to a standard sit-down establishment, such as Applebee's...for about the same price.
3 ||| Took my buddy here the other day to nurse a hangover. Great food. Reasonably priced. Definitely did the job for us. They are open til 2pm serving breakfast. Friendly staff. They brought us pitchers of our drinks so we didn't have to chase a waitress down everytime we wanted a refill. I like that.
0 ||| I'm new to town and I picked this place because of the good reviews. The first time I went I had gel polish, but it came already chipping off after 7 days! I never had that experience before. Gel polish easily last 3 weeks and usually only has to be replaced because it grows out. Also, they don't have the same brand nail polish that they use for gel polish, so for your toe nails, you have to pick a color that comes close, but you see always a difference, especially once it's on your nails. I decided to give them another chance and went  back after three weeks, and when they took off the nail polish on my toe nails, I saw I had fungus! They reassured me it was 'normal'.  Then I had the manicure, the girl that helped me cut in my cuticles, leaving an ugly scab on my finger. Nail salons are all over the place, so there is really no need to go back here.
0 ||| I visited Freedom Square Diner on a Sunday for a late breakfast. My girlfriend and I arrived at 10:45 and we're told there was a 15 minute wait, which was no big deal.  We were then seated around 11:00. We ordered our food shortly thereafter.  To make a long story short we were brought the wrong food (I ordered an omelette I received sunny side up eggs) after 20 minutes. We then had to wait an additional 35 minutes for the correct meals. Which still weren't exactly what we had ordered. My girlfriend asked for sausage she got bacon. I asked for Mancini's bread but received rye. The home fries were also undercooked. By that point we had both lost our appetites. I like supporting local businesses, but next time I'll go to a chain.
1 ||| Awesome pizza but the service was horrible. It took over 20 minutes to get a glass of water. The couple next to us sat after we did but they got their water immediately. We will not return
1 ||| Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.
2 ||| This was my 3rd year in a row coming there.\nWhen I went to check in on Mon at noon, they told me it would be $20 for early check in....or I could wait til 3pm.   I had just flow 5 hrs from DC and didn't want to wait.   It left a bad taste in my mouth all week.\nAdd this to the fact that all during x-mas week, the hotel was empty.\nLove the fact they only play x-mas music on dec 25 and no other days.\nLove that the hotel isn't so big.\nDisappointed there are no frig in room.\nDon't mind that its not on the strip....I enjoy walking the 30 minutes to the strip.\nHotel seems like its not the in place anymore.\nBiggest complaint is the shuttle to the Strip:\nIt only goes to the fashion mall.\nWhy not just go up the street and drop off at planet hollywood or something?\nShuttle runs on the hour but it only takes 15 minutes to get to the mall.\nRest of the time it sits in the HRH garage.   If it ran more often and went to more places, I could cut down on cabs (Cabs from HRH to strip are about $20)\n\nCVS across the street is a god send.
0 ||| Worst doctor office. Do not go here. Very rude costumer service and do not care about patient health. By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had.
4 ||| We went here last night after reading the rave reviews about how good it was for gluten free. We arrived just after 6pm with no reservation. When we walked in the place was wedged and we were worried we wouldn't get a table but after about 5mins we were shown to one but I would definitely advise booking if you can as people after us did have a bit of a wait. \n\nIn all my travels I have never seen such a huge gluten free menu! I couldn't decide so my boyfriend kindly agreed to order from the gf menu so we could share. We started with crispy chicken wings. Perfectly crisped and the veg was almost caramelised with a hint of chilli. The chicken fell off the bone and we were licking our fingers wishing we had ordered more.\n\nFor mains I had king prawns with asparagus and black bean sauce with ginger rice. My boyfriend had king prawn tempura with a teriyaki sauce and chilli rice. The rices definitely complimented the dishes well, they were full of flavour. I haven't had black bean since being diagnosed a coeliac and I was not disappointed. I was worried about the batter on the tempura dish as it tasted too good to be gf! But I'm feeling no side effects this morning and wondering how nobody else has managed to do this.\nWe had plum wine throughout which was sweet but not overbearingly so. I was disappointed to hear that this place may be closing due to the owner leaving. Such a fantastic gem with many regulars and the best gf menu I've seen in the world will be a loss.\nI would come back to Edinburgh just to go to this restaurant it is that good!
0 ||| This is by far the worst restaurant in Las Vegas. \nI am from Argentina and also Italian. Both combination of food were absolutely horrendous.\nService I snot only slow but cheap and almost not existent.\nI am for sure that the other reviews are internet or some friend of them. It was the most discussing food in my life.\nEverything was reheated and old. \nPlease do yourself a favor and go to McDonald ....it's way better..ugh!
0 ||| Nice rooms but I'd only return I'd there was a coffee maker in the room. If the want you to get up and gamble they shouldn't make guests wait in the 40 + people long line at either Starbucks for overpriced drip !
3 ||| Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, \"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.
1 ||| Items Selected:\nMac & Cheese Balls - House made bacon mac & cheese balled up in Panko breadcrumbs and golden fried\nFried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich - Fried Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon Waffles and Wild Turkey Maple Syrup served with Sweet Potato Tots\nFrench Toast - Vanilla Bean Soaked Brioche topped with 'drunk' mixed berries, syrup, powdered sugar\n\nLocated on the corner of trendy East Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard, with raves received from hipsters since its inception, it was just minutes before noon that I sat down with a friend for lunch at Park on Fremont and although I'm happy to say the service far outperformed similar spots in Chicago, Brooklyn, or Portland the food itself left much to be desired - a seemingly well-culled menu instead proving limited in not only options but quality of execution, as well.  Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and d\u00e9cor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux-taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found.  Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'\n\nNot exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each.
2 ||| This place is all right. Check in was a breeze (maybe because I came at 4am!). Yes it's old and outdated, but there's free wi-fi, so that's a plus for me. :)
4 ||| This restaurant is everything I love about Phoenix. It combines San Francisco sophistication with San Antonio humulity, and even features Mrs. Myers delightful brew in the bathrooms. Folks, if you can only have one nice dinner in Arizona this is the place. I would give one bonus star for their amazing lunch specials, if I only could.
3 ||| The 4-star rating is purely as compared to other buffets not as a comparative to a \"real\" restaurant. \n\nAfter having been a good boy for months, I sucumbed to the temptation or rather the convenience of dining buffet style. \n\nAs far as buffets go, The Bellagio buffet is pretty good - although since it is food on an assembly line the taste is not as good as a sit down restaurant. \n\nThe buffet features the ubiquitous shrimp that are found at even the cheapest buffets and also some crab.\nOther than that, the fare includes: american, italian, chinese and japanese dishes. The Bellagio is a little lite on the vegetarian fare - but I guess they will eventually catch up to the current trend.   \n\nThe desserts are quite extensive, although none were outstanding (comparable to most upperscale hotel sunday brunches).\n\nProbably one of the better ones in Vegas.
0 ||| I took my mom and grandma to the Beach House last night for dinner thinking it would be better than getting a Papa Murphy's pizza. There weren't many patrons in the dining room. Our waitress was very short with us, demanding our drink orders before taking any questions or orders for our food. I ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if I could get warmer food. She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food. They scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before. The waitress didn't seem to care about the quality of the food and seemed to be either having a terrible night or was on the influence of something. Needless to say, I will not be returning. On a positive note, the sunset on the lake is pretty.
3 ||| Big.  Scary.  Walmart.
3 ||| Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good. Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious.
1 ||| Service was good, but that is all I can probably say about this place, because the food wasn't.\n\nI ordered the Tuscana Sausage Soup, the potatoes in it weren't cooked/boiled all the way, it was sort of too salty, but the sausage in there was pretty good.\n\nBuild your own Pasta seemed like a good choice besides Pizza, but I was wrong. I chose spaghetti, bologonese sauce (meat sauce), meatballs and mushrooms for my pasta. It came out to around $22 - 24 for the pasta and those two added ingredients. While the spaghetti and sauce tasted fine, it wasn't hot, it was semi warm, and everything else that came with it. The meat balls tasted like frozen meat balls from the market, it was also warm like the pasta.\n\nAll in all, I didn't like the pasta, maybe I will opt for a slice of pizza instead.
3 ||| Ripping Records: the number one place to get your tickets in person for all gigs/events offered from Ticket Master and basically anything that's \"happening\" in the Town. This means any event in Edinburgh, Scotland or even the big festivals for other areas of the UK. The service at times can be a bit slow (especially if you are paying by credit card) but they are very friendly and chatty. \nAlso while you are waiting in the cue or still deciding where to go, this shop has a rather decent selection to browse though and purchase if you so wish. \n\nIt's a deceiving shop, hardly noticeable on this busy street but rather useful to know about if you need a ticket for a gig or seek inspiration for a special night out.
1 ||| Beer is ok.\n\nFood...meh.\n\nAfter watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule.\n\nThe menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage.\n\nAs for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort.\n\nSo assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also.
0 ||| Maybe there was only one person working at the kitchen this morning and this was the reason I got yesterday's potatoes for breakfast.. Maybe all the employees partied hard last night and they found it too hard to clean the tables, pick up trash from the floor and overall \"make it all work\", maybe the manager was depressed and he had some cruel cartoons (intended for children) running on TV,  in a place with NO children. Maybe... Maybe I will just choose a different place for Sunday breakfast next week.
2 ||| The only thing nice was that eating at Tao allowed us to get into the club for free and no waiting in line.  \n\nI had the salmon with udon & spinach which sounded great.  I had the salmon medium rare and it was as expected.  The udon was a little salty.  It was hard to hear people speaking with the club music bleeding over to the restaurant.  The service was pretty good and the overall menu had a pretty good selection of food.
0 ||| One word.... Horrible.
4 ||| let me preface by saying that vegas is not on my top ten of fun.  i feel like i spend or give away (ie gambling) a lot of money for things that that are not as fun as anticipated and eventually leads me to lung cancer (because everyone has a cigarette in their hands).  that said, the wynn is the exception.  from walking through other resorts, i also very, VERY much appreciate the lack of resort employees hassling you to see a show.  i could not believe even relatively nice places like the Venetian and Cesar's has people at every corner trying to sell you a \"great deal\" on a show.  UGH LEAVE ME ALONE!!  this alone made me feel relieved i was staying at the wynn, away from be accosted all day long.\nrooms are beautiful, on the 58th floor looking down on the strip was actually tranquil and relaxing.  bathrooms are large and fully equipped for a great soak in the tub.  i loved laying on the bed and watching the storms pass over the mountains.\nif it was not 100 billion degrees outside, i would have also been very happy to sit poolside at the wynn longer than i did.  the european pool is great even though my mojito was $14 and beer is $6.50 (yikes!).  bartenders are friendly and not at all pushy with the drinks.  the grill is expensive as well, but you at least do get what you pay for.  our burgers were enormous and tasty.  i especially liked my turkey burger.\ni really don't see myself going to vegas anytime soon, but if we do come back i am definitely staying at the wynn again.
4 ||| Went to Border Grill in the Madalay Bay Hotel. We had the lunch salad special-WOW. It was served with chicken, but I asked for Talapia instead and Tom had the chicken. The salad was an amazing blend of hot, sweet, and tart. The salad had slices of nectarines, peaches, grapes and spiced candied walnuts. The service was outstanding and Tom Davis was our waiter. The guacamole is the best and the sparkling peach lemonade was outstanding. We had half a piece of the chocolate pie that had the perfect amount of cinnamon. It would be a place to go again and again. Outstanding.
2 ||| Beautiful restaurant, it made me forget that I was in Arizona. Love the rustic wood chairs, iron chandeliers, and stone work on the walls. Stunning! Excellent bread and amazing olive oil. I had the spinach pasta with scallops, mushrooms and a cherry tomato sauce. It was good but I felt like it was missing something. I guess it just need a kick. My boyfriend had the lasagna and he said it was good but not amazing like the server described. We will be back since I would like to try some other items on their menu.
0 ||| I have been to this jiffy lube before and the service here has always been great. However, after my most recent trip here, let's just say things weren't so great.  I parked my car behind the building where the line says 'SMOG LINE' and a manager approached me. He mentioned that the wait time was about an hour and a half. He asked me if I wanted to wait and I said yes. Then he started sweating and looked around nervously and suggested to me another business around the corner with much faster service even after I agreed to wait. I've never been basically told to kick rocks by a manager especially as a paying customer. I'm not too sure what drugs or drinks had been consumed but this was just crazy. I've never felt so embarrassed and stupid leaving a business before. Basically defeating my purpose of getting in the car in the first place. \n\n\nThis WAS my neighborhood car repair service center, but after this experience I will definitely look to yelp in finding a new care center for my vehicle!!
3 ||| YUM.\nWe went here for the Hub's birthday and we were not sad! Here is what we had:\n\nGorgonzola Truffle Fries-if you only order one thing while you are here get these. They are so ridiculously good.\n\nBYOB-(Build your own burger?)-I had the veggie burger which was surprisingly super good! The only complaint I really had with it was it kind of fell apart-but flavor-wise I would get it again. I would definitely get the truffle aioli on whatever you order. \n\nDon't bother ordering a salad-meh. The hub got a buffalo burger which was also just meh. Our friends ordered the regular hamburger patty and I would say that and the veggie burger were my favorites. \n\nWe didn't try any shakes because we were too full (wamp wamp). Beer was good, but I would pass on the mixed drinks-they were not anything special.
4 ||| Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)
0 ||| Wow I don't even know where to begin with this place. Since I was staying in the MGM Resort and was craving some pizza, Yelp said this spot was popping. As we walked up we were glad to be introduced to the familiar concept of build your own pizza like Pieology. I was super stoked to pick out all of my toppings and what not. They called our order and they said they burned my pizza and they'll remake it. Ok that's fine no problemo. Pizza #2 I get it and it's missing hella toppings....umm seriously? I should have asked for my money back at that point, but I figured 3rd time is always a charm. So pizza #3: they just put the missing toppings on Pizza #2 and put it back in the oven so of course they burn pizza #3... Eff it, I gave up, they couldn't make a pizza right with 3 tries so forget it. The bf's pizza tasted great so I missed out on awesome pizza due to incompetent pizza makers....sad day.
4 ||| You can't go wrong with this place. Anything you order will melt your heart and have you wishing you lived near this bakery. Sometimes there is a line and nowhere to sit but who cares. Learn to be patient , walk to the nearest park and enjoy bliss.
1 ||| I wanted to like this place so badly, and I was actually thinking of giving it a second chance before writing this review. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I do not want to come here again.\n\nFirst of all, I've never eaten Taiwanese food before and I didn't really know what to order off their very extensive menu.  The first waitress couldn't help us bc she didn't speak English.  The second waitress was just generally unhlepful in making recommendations or explaining what the different dishes were.\n\nWe ended up ordered a squid and vegetable dish and a kung pao chicken dish.  They took SOOOOO long to come out!  After 20 minutes of waiting we find out that there is a problem with the rice cooker sothat's why everything is taking so long.  Finally, after 30+ minutes the squid dish comes out.  The \"vegetables\" in the dish were JUST cabbage.  And the squid was just the frozen, pre-cut kind that you can buy at the store.\n\nThe kung pao chicken was slightly better and in a very flavorful, savory sauce.  But the rice was still soggy when it came out, even though it took 45 minutes for us to get it.\n\nso yeah, I wanted to like this place and I always root for independent small business owners, but this place was just not good enough to warrant a second visit.
1 ||| Rude waitresses!!!! They take forever to get to you and help other people before you when you have repeatedly made eye contact with them for the last 8 minutes.  Cool club.....used to play more hip hop but now its on the Rhianna/Lady Gaga vibe.  Aside from the waitress staff, nice club.  Stay away from the brunette in the cornerr closest to the entrance! She has an attitude problem.
2 ||| The food is really good here and the prices are decent HOWEVER, every single time I've come here (three times) the service is crappy. For example: you get to the front of the restaurant and there's a sign in sheet. Signed in, nobody comes out for 3-4 minutes. Two other groups sign in and have a seat. The hostess comes out and immediately begins the process of seating the couple sitting next to the sign in sheet which she didn't even consider looking at! Luckily they told her they weren't first. We get seated, order, food comes out and then we're ignored. I ran out of every beverage. Waitress said she was going to come back....nope. Another gal was walking around filling up cups-every table but ours! At this point I'm starting to take it personal. The family that sat behind us were clearly friends of the manager because they had top notch service. Someone was there constantly asking if they were okay. So f you Gilbert house. You're a Regina George and I now feel personally victimized
4 ||| I can't say enough about how much I love this studio. I gave the studio a try on the insistence of one of my friends who has been practicing there for a while. We tried an initial class together and the rest is history- I'm hooked! \n\nThere are so many things about the studio that I love. The location is perfect in Plaza Midwood and there is ample parking. Upon walking in, there is always a friendly face to greet you at the door. Sometimes there is even a puppy face to greet you which is even better. :-) The check in process is quick and easy with a scanable key chain card. There are cubby holes to put your stuff into and plenty of areas to change, grab water and get ready. \n\nThe hot yoga studio (A) is huge and beautiful! Hardwood floors and red brick walls stretching up to high ceilings. The decorations are fun and tasteful and fit with the vibe of the studio. There are parking spots for mats not uncomfortably close to your neighboring mat. There are no mirrors on the walls as the instructors coach you through looking at your body and feeling your way through a pose as opposed to focusing on how it looks. \n\nWhen the class is ready to begin the instructor introduces themselves and gets you started in your first pose. The instructors speak through the class re-inforcing the Baptiste yoga principles through the practice and always add so much to think about (and often laugh about) through the practice. After a short warm up (which you might be surprised is just a warm up) they start the class with an \"Om\". This was new to me and I really wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, so I didn't do it the first few classes which wasn't an issue at all. Everyone is focused on their own practice so you're very free to go where you want to in your practice. Next the flow sequence begins. It's challenging, hot and rewarding. Coming from a studio that heated their room to 105-110 degrees, I love the temps being between 95-100. Hot enough to warm up the muscles and get a good sweat going, but not so hot that it's distracting. \n\nEach class is different. Different instructors bring a different experience to each class. Surprisingly I found that I enjoy the 90 minute classes the most and there are certain instructors that I will happily rearrange my schedule to make their class. (Daniel, David, Sally, Liz....) Each class offers a wide variety of options for your practice from modifications to poses to moving into advanced poses. Where you bring your practice is up to you and there is no judgement regardless of what you decide! Sometimes I'll move into side crow from chair twist, other times I'll happily sit in chair twist and regardless of what I do I feel great about it. \n\nThe instructors are encouraging and never fail to challenge you to push your limits. They emphasize matching breath with movement and proper pose aligment. They and the assistants are happy to come over and help you in any pose. Oh the assistants- one of the best things about Y1! Each of the assistant in class (from one to three!) is specially trained to come around and assist you in your poses. Each assist feels like a mini-massage and is just wonderful- not to mention helpful to find your place in a pose. :-) \n\nEnding the practice with Savasana the lights are turned down, the fans turned on and a cold lavendar washcloth set at the top of your mat to place on your face (or whereever you like) to assist with cooling you down. \n\nI've taken the 60minute, 90 minute and deep stretch classes and enjoyed all of them. I'm very excited to start taking the Wednesday night foundational classes to become more acquainted with proper pose alignment. They also offer fantastic workshops- seems to be every weekend and other group activities. I love their committment to the community and local charities. \n\nCan't think of anything negative to say! (Unless you talk to me the days that I'm so sore I can barely move- but even then I feel great!!)
0 ||| I have to agree with the 2 guys that gave this place 1 star. The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund. I have lived in rough places but this was by far worse than living in the projects. Please think twice about renting from this place save yourself some headaches and look elsewhere.
4 ||| You need to go here!  They have an amazing menu full of breakfast classics that you'd expect, but they also mix things up a bit by offering some of those same classics with a twist like the Southern Waffle with an egg, cheese, sour cream, and salsa,  or Eggs Benedict with crab meat served on a waffle. SO GOOD!
1 ||| Mommy/daughter day. Went for haircuts nearby and my 10 year old decided to give Jewish deli a try. While we loved the food, the service was awful. Got the early bird special of a corned beef ruben (they split it in the kitchen for us) and I asked to add a bowl of soup (the early bird menu states it is $1.95 to add soup or salad). I asked if the matzo ball soup was available for that. Ended up being charged full price ($4.50) because the server didn't \"understand\" me. Shared the blintzes for dessert. Yum!\nAll the savory items needed seasoning, but in our area (many seniors) most places under salt. This was no exception. No problem, there is salt on the table. My 10 year old is now a covert to Matzo ball soup!\nOur server ignored us most of the time. We sat with our menus closed in front of us for over 10 minutes. Our server only had 1 other table. I paid $2.50 for an iced tea that was never refilled. When our bill turned up wrong, it took me almost 10 minutes to get her attention as she never looked over to our table. Then she ARGUED with me about it. It was my first time there and I knew more about the menu than she did! Finally she said she would pay the difference out of her own pocket. That's a nice way of saying she didn't want to get caught making a mistake. I asked for the manager.\nI am generally a really good tipper. I've been a server and/or server trainer for most of my life. When I got the bill, under tip I wrote, \"get a different job\".\nI would eat there again, but not with that server or I'd get my food to go.
2 ||| I was not too impressed by this place overall. Maybe my expectations were too high, but either way the food was just okay. I ordered the chili cheese dog and side of fries to share with my friend. The fries were pretty good and came in a larger amount so it is perfect for sharing. The hot dog just did not have the crisp that I wanted and the chili just did not have the flavors I look for in a chili. My friend thought they put too many onions on hers, but I liked it that way. I think I might give this place another try and see how I feel then.
4 ||| almost like chipotle, but better. same format but you get legit hawaiian meats like huli hulu chicken, and fried fish. their sesame vinaigrette is so good! and the chocolate coconut bars were tasty too. highly recommend this place. \n\nif you're looking for super authentic hawaiian food, this place is NOT IT. but it is a good mix of chipotle with an island swag. \n\nobviously, services is friendly as well. they're from hawaii! mahalo, braddah!
2 ||| After seeing such great reviews on Yelp, I decided to take the gf to this little Italian place in Gilbert. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this place, and the owner was really nice. But.....all I can muster up was a meh. First, the decore just doesn't seem to fit the restaurant name. The name says to me, nice Italian restaurant. We walked in, it seemed....sparten. There's just something missing that makes it feel Italian. Anything...some rustic decoration? Idk. I really think the ambiance can be much better if they did something.... It was mostly just plain walls with some murals. Anyhow, I'm not here to eat the food, not the wall decore. We ordered some Clams Casino s for appetizer. The gf ordered Chicken Campagnola and I ordered Veal Scaloppine Principessa. So the clams.... Cardinal sin #1, you never ever serve sandy clams. You must soak the clams in fresh water for at least 20 minutes to rid of the salt and sand. Well, the gf and I tried 2 clams each and every single one of them were sandy. Crunch crunch crunch. Uck. I am grateful that that item was taken off our bill. Just for that I think they deserve half a star more. On to the entrees. While the flavors were not bad, I do feel like the food is towards average than good. My veal was slightly over cooked but fairly tasty with the sauce on top. It just didn't give me the vibe of this is so good I want it again. My gf's chicken was definitely way overcooked. It was tough and the sauce was on the salty side (and I'm a salt junkie). Overall, I dare say I've had better food at certain Macaroni Grill chains so..... I do really want to like this place because it's so close to where we live..... But for the food they serve, I think they can be $3-4 less. I would've gladly pay the price if the food had impressed me. Alas, the search for a great Italian restaurant with reasonable price continues.....
3 ||| I want to say first that I am not only mildly obsessive compulsive, but I am my mother's daughter, making me very, very stereotypically Jewish (this is a recently common theme/disclaimer, I know) (my boyfriend is destined for sainthood... don't worry, I talked to God, he says it's cool).\n\nThis means that I am basically NEVER happy with car washes, among other things.\n\nThat said, I really like this car wash... they're just as the title says. I took my mud-bogged car there and they took so much extra time out to make sure all the mud was off and without the requisite upcharge. It wasn't an AMAZING job, but it was the kind of job Los Olivos or Weiss Guys would charge twice the price for. And, the people there were remarkably friendly.
1 ||| Crap.\n\nCrap crap.\n\nCrap.\n\nIs that not sufficient?  Do you need more than that?  Okay: go there and order a reuben, and see what happens.  First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.\n\nThen they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.\n\nOr, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.\n\nI hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.  Because the place sucked a fat one.
2 ||| I came here on a Saturday for lunch and it was packed so we took our food to go. By the time I was able to eat my torta ahogada, it had already soaked up all the spicy sauce it was swimming in and was soggy and quickly disintegrating. Normally I'm pretty tolerant to spicy foods but all I could taste was spicy. My friend got 3 fish tacos, which were super tiny. He was still hungry afterwards so he had san other full meal. Overall, it did not live up to all the good reviews I kept reading about on Yelp.
1 ||| OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed.
0 ||| Ah Sin? More like Oh Shit. \n\nI would try to avoid this place at all costs if possible because this has got to be the crappiest sushi I've ever eaten. \n\nSure the place is nice and chic, that's expected. It's effin' Vegas. But the food, gah! The only thing good about it was the Miso soup and that was probably because we were all hungrier than Ghandi. We ordered the AYCE Sushi and our loud ass, probably-not-Japanese, waitress who seemed like she was rushed all the time, decided to inform us of a few things:\n\nWaitress: \"OK! JUS' LET YOU KNOW THAT ISS TEN O' CLAW AND THE KITCHAN CLOSE AT TEN THUTTY SO WE JUST BRING EBBRYTING ON DA TABLE OK?? OK!!!\" \n\nUs: \"Uhh, okay?\"\n\nWaitress: \"OK!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd then she continued to bring out the most stalest sushi known to man. She piled the plates on our table and kept making sure that we knew that the kitchen was closing at 10:30 so it kind of felt like she was kind of rushing us to scarf down our food and get the hell outta there. The sushi she brought us was plentiful. Yeah. Plenty full of SHIT! It was like someone took porridge, froze it, thawed it for about 10 seconds and used that as the rice. I felt like I was eating something a kindergartener made during arts n' crafts time with glue for the sauce and construction paper for the seaweed. On top of all that, we still had our waitress yelling at us about the time. \n\nOverall, I was glad she rushed us because I couldn't stand eating one more bite of that diarrhea for food. Do not go here unless you're a glutton for eating fake prop food meant for real estate showings.
3 ||| I come to this location once every two weeks. Great selection of organic vegetables which they rotate so people who buy mostly organic aren't always stuck buying the same vegetables every week. The employees are usually nice and willing to go out of their way to help... only downside is sometimes it is difficult to find someone to help.  Some of the cashiers are a bit quirky but they mean well. Some reviewers complained about long lines but I haven't had a problem with that... however I typically go during the week.  I enjoy shopping here.
3 ||| great place, friendly and relaxed.  Built around the idea of a genuine family restaurant with a small (big for the space) soft play in the back room.  You could go without kids, sitting in the front, but it's sells itself and really caters for families.  Excellent general facilities in terms of baby changing, space for buggies.  I like the food - not excellent but good quality and quantity.  Usually always a smile from the staff who seem to have the patience of saints given I have been in when it's like a chimps tea party.  I would love to see more genuine family spaces like this in Edinburgh.
1 ||| The first thing I noticed when I walked into the lobby was the cigarette smoke smell.  Okay, to be fair, all of the hotels/casinos allow smoking - as annoying as it is.  But I get it.  Gamblers smoke.  However, I walked through most of the casinos on the strip, and none of them had the stench of Bally's.  They all had either some sort of air fresheners to mask the smell, or at the very least better ventilation.  Bally's simply stunk.  And pretty bad.  They definitely need better ventilation in the casino/lobby.  Secondly, the entire time I was playing the games over three days, NOT ONE cocktail waitress offered me a drink.  I was under the impression that as long as you are gambling, drinks are on the house.  In fact, the one or two waitresses I did see were not accepting anything more than tips for the drinks.  I don't know why I was ignored.  My room was very nice, and extremely big.  I did, however, have to put the heat on 80 degrees to get it warm (I happened to visit Vegas on the coldest days of the year).  The hotel/casino was nice, but comparatively speaking, not nearly as nice as the others I saw on the strip, for similar prices.  Next time I go to Vegas I'm staying elsewhere.
1 ||| I was expecting it to be better. I got a brownie and a cream puff and both were average. I've had better at a supermarket. I love cake boss so I was hoping this would be good. I'll just stick to the cupcakery for my baked goods.
1 ||| First I will say, this is a nice atmosphere and the food was fine. But for the price, the portion size, the $2 upcharge for brown rice (on top of the price for the lunch) and the very slow service at lunch, this is what brings me to the lower rating. \n\nI've been to other Thai places here in the Valley, that the food has a little more flavor, the portions are better, the service faster, and no additional charges for a different kind of rice.\n\nGive it a try, but don't expect a lot.
3 ||| Classic MAC and CHEESE pizza!! There is no way you can miss this being in Wisconsin, where cheese is king ~~ The other pizzas they make are good too, but I just can't say enough about their mac and cheese pizza. One day when I leave town, this will be one of the classics that I will certainly miss, no doubt. \n\nI love how Ian's has their pizza is a slice or as a whole. So if you find yourself craving pizza and you can't find 10 other people to share with you, or if your friends have very distinct preferences for pizza toppings, you can just each get your own slice and still hang out together.
3 ||| Get the jack Mac, very good. Went for lunch. (Get the bowl if you're hungry.)\n\nDefinitely go back.
3 ||| wow!! beautiful, spectacular., love it .As we walk in a friendly check in service, got a beautiful one bedroom apartment with terrace,spectacular view towards  Bellagio .really high tech,very specious .All the Valle people very nice.Our bell person Lydia Moreno  very nice friendly informative show us around.\ni did my hair at the salon by Andeen she was very nice friendly and done a good job for my bridal hair. \n the pool was,t what i expect.it,s not that deep or big.the one by the strip the closing hour said 11 but at 10.45 when i was try to visit to try to take some picture and try to walk around a very rude young man ask me multiple times to leave and tell me his boos order him to do that.i ask to spik to the manager he toll me to find him some were out.and the second back up a security guy is coming.that ruin my night.the second day i call to speak to the manager in charge Eddie Feliciano,they told me he was,t available and he never try to return my phone as i ask.I want. to be clear why it say closing ours at 11 but they told me on the phone 8,with out any specifications.\nwe spend weekend also there. the atmosphere because of the club was very a life ,elegant and a lot of sexy girls.\nwe request our room to be touch up for the day were we have photos taking  for our weeding day in the gorges room and  it took about an hour.. we barely made it .\nBut over all I love it I enjoy my vacation we definitely  gone came back there.And if the pool manager would call back to clear the closing hours would get 5 stars from me.
0 ||| After making an order online, I found a hair baked into my slice of pizza! Immediately, I became disgusted and ruined my whole families appetite and mines. I called and talked to the Manager Billy who was completely unprofessional and arrogant, he then demanded I bring back the pizza (we threw this pizza away) or else he couldn't replace our order. After explaining that I threw this pizza away, his response was \"What are you trying to get something for free\"? I have a history with Pizza Hut and they can look up my number and I have never asked for a refund of any one of my orders, I am a hard working man who don't need a $7.99 pizza for \"FREE\" all I wanted was to provide my family with dinner of their choice. After all the other options there is in laveen, we will be ordering Barro's next time and EVERY TIME after! See my picture I attached to this Pizza Hut if you don't believe me.
4 ||| I am new to waxing so I was nervous how to find a good professional who I would trust with my waxing needs. Leslee is fantastic! She makes it so easy and quick. Not to mention she's so nice and bubbly. I would highly recommend her for your waxing needs. She's super flexible and able to fit you in on short notice which makes it really convenient for last-minute needs before a vacation or whatnot. She also has facial services which I will definitely be trying here in the near future!
2 ||| Cheap beer, neat setting, lots of seating but fairly quiet on a Saturday night around 11pm...I was pretty hyped in coming to this place but the vibe there was just too quiet and they didn't really have a lot of beer selection, altho they did have their own brewery in the background
0 ||| Eek - If you are considering getting married here I would bring in your own Wedding Planner who is a Professional ! The lady running this is extremely rude and does not work well with families or vendors !   USually when you are a planner at a venue you solve problems and dont just shrug you shoulders and ay oh well ! -
4 ||| The bomb- awesome- just like the Beverly Hills place.\nNot only is the food amazing- but they actually used alcohol\nin there drinks  (unlike many places in Vegas)\nWe went on a Thursday night- and the eye candy of \"available\"\nwomen waiting for clients was mind boggling.  \nAll the senses my senses were tickled at dinner.
1 ||| Chicken not as good as KFC or even Basha's. Frozen Eggo waffles are better. \n\nRed velvet cake was very disgusting. Fried okra was soggy and too expensive. Soul food with no soul!\n\nWaffles and chicken are an odd combination that might have worked had they been good.\n\nDid I mention that the place is overpriced?\n\nThe best thing -- it provides employment for blacks right in the middle of whitey Scottsdale. The staff was very friendly (but incompetent) so I'll rate the place with 2 star instead of one!\n\nI have been there twice and it was just as bad both times. Will never return.
1 ||| Gold's is a nice lounge, but there is something missing from this place that makes it kinda blah over all, but was a nice place to grab a quick drink with friends.
1 ||| They showed up 20 minutes late at our hour long party, many kids were disappointed that they could not get their face painted\nI tried to call them several times to find out what was happening and nobody answered. Nobody has contacted me to apologize,  \nUnfortunately I had not seen previous reviews on this service, it seems that been late is normal for them\nI would not recommend them
0 ||| hella stuffy.\nhella no space to dance.\nloooonnnggeessst wait ever in my life (even my party was on the guestlist).
2 ||| Rage cycles is a cool little bike repair / sales shop in S. Scottsdale. Its a cute little store with a couple of rooms that is organized well by bicycle type as you would assume; a few fixed (not many) road, mountain, cruiser, etc... \n\nI took in my fixie because I blew a tire on Saturday night and needed it repaired on the quick, and I don't currently have any of my old tools close. While I was there, I figured I'd have them throw in some new batteries into my lights and also rip off that front brake I never used. \n\nI was surprised they made me wait several hours as they had a lot of work to do that day, granted the work I needed would have been made easy. \n\nThe negative: They never called me. After several hours, I finally called them to follow. He finally explained the sitch and told that it was actually my tire, not the tube and so forth and told me he'd call me back in 10 minutes... \n\nAgain: Never called me. I called back after 30  minutes and he said that it would be ready soon. I went in to pick it up and they couldn't find my ticket, though my bike was just chillin next to the front check out desk. \n\nThe positive: The store is nice, and hip. I like how indie it and not trying to be mainstream it is. Bike maintenance inside, and full on bike shop out back. Plus, they have a lot of sweet bike jumps in the back, to practice on if you are plan on buying a stunt / mountain bike. It isn't big, but its certainly above what most bike stores offer. \n\nThis is the type of place I am glad exists in my neighborhood, but they could use a boost in their customer service skills.
2 ||| Just a regular old pawn shop. I think I expected to see one of the cast members there, which probably would've made it a 4 star experience. Still, it's something to do if you're in the area.
4 ||| I can be a pretty demanding customer., especially with the stress of buying a new house coupled with a new job in the same week. Nick helped to make things a little less stressful. \n\nI called him on a Tuesday to do a difficult ceiling fan install on 14 ft high vaulted ceilings. He was there Wednesday afternoon and did everything that was required to get it done. Whoever build my house/did the wiring did a half assed job that rivaled DMV customer service. Nick worked under the light if a headlamp, cut into drywall, went to a hardware store, rewired the entire system, and then installed the second one. He was there for over 4 hours and kept us informed the whole way through. He stayed over 4 hours, until the job was completed. \n\nAfter that we had a conversation with him where he have us insider knowledge on what plumbers charge (ever heard of a trip charge? That's where you pay some clown to come out to tell you he can't fix something). I will be using nick for this home and every other property I own. He even charged us less than quoted and wouldn't take my cash when I tried to pay extra. I'll have to find a way to sneak it in to payment for other jobs!
4 ||| This place was soo much fun. The food was delicious. Bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night. Definitely will come back
0 ||| My friend and I ate here on a whim earlier this summer because we were craving Mexican food and it looked nice and authentic. It was quite possibly the worst Mexican food either of us had ever had. There was a ton of people finishing up eating because they had just come from a softball game or something. My friend and I ordered the flautas combo meal, both which came with guacamole. It came out right away, but it was stone cold. Like it had been sitting there, maybe they were anticipating someone from the game would order the flautas meal but no one ever did, and they gave it to us instead? The outside was stale, the meat inside (shredded chicken and beef) was soo dry, tasteless, and crunchy (yes, crunchy from being left out for so long). Also, neither of our meals had guacamole on the plate even though it was supposed to come with it. So the waitress gave us $1 off each meal instead of bringing out some guacamole.:( The beans were so watery, it seemed like they were running out because so many people were in before we came in so they added water to them. Like we definitely could have used a straw to drink the beans. $22 later we hardly tasted our meals and had to leave because we could not physically make ourselves eat the food. We maybe just had a bad experience because we were coming in right after all the baseball/softball people were leaving, but still, neither of us would ever come back. The people who work here are super nice, if the food was decent I'd return.
0 ||| Full disclosure: the food was 3 stars, maybe 4. Unfortunately this is a one-star review because we literally had the WORST WAITER ever.\n\nWe were seated quickly. Water and menus appeared. Waiter was not overly friendly, but not callous yet. We ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich. Again, the food was pretty good. Overpriced, but that's par for the course in Vegas.\n\nSadly, the waiter was totally inattentive. He disappeared for long stretches of time, avoided eye contact when walking by, made no effort to check on us when the food took a long time to come out, or to ask us how it was afterward. He gave us the check without asking if we wanted dessert, which is a big no-no in my book. He practically growled when he spoke. He was just super grumpy and obviously didn't want to be there. \n\nSave yourself the headache and eat at Pink's.
4 ||| We moved to the area recently & have been here a few times. Sushi is great and reasonable! My husband is not a sushi fan, but they have quite a few meat dishes. The happy hour menu is great! Only downside is that I've had to wait for a table every time I've ben there, but was seated in a decent amount of time...it's a small restaurant so it's understandable.
3 ||| This was a great place!. My husband and I love Italian foods and this was really awesome!\n\nWe chose to go here following fellow reviewers and it was the best choice we've made in a while.\n\nMy favorite was their fresh homemade mozzarella, OMG A+++\n\nAnd the sweet sausage was the bomb to say the least.\n\nWe will definitely be buying all our items from here, especially anytime we make our large Italian dinners for special occasions!\n\nAwesome job guys thank you!
3 ||| I love going to this place. I usually go with my sister to catch up with great conversation and great, healthy food. I had thought in the past that it was a fast greek chain like pita pit, but it's actually a sit down restaurant. We ALWAYS start with the Fruit & Cheese Fantasia. It is SO good, and it's gigantic. The fruit and the cheese are such good quality its hard to stop eating. I would order the mediterranean chicken pita, sometimes we would be so full from the fruit and cheese we would share one or take home half. The service is good, they are polite and timely with your order. I would recommend pita jungle.
1 ||| Great food - miserable service.  The food is outstanding and reasonably priced for a brand name chef restaurant on The Strip.  The service was slow and inattentive.  Not a positive experience even wit wonderful dishes.
2 ||| Almost every hotel in Las Vegas has some sort of cafe option to their never-ending buffets.  Wynn, even in all it's glory and splendor, is no exception.  Terrace Pointe Cafe, just a few steps beyond the Buffet offers a good variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees and sits quite comfortably in that lonely, yet elusive space between Wynn's numerous high-end fine dining choices and their buffet.\n\nFor the most part, the menu contains standard cafe items with a Wynn flare, i.e. the decadent lobster benedicts and kobe beef sliders.  I thoroughly enjoyed my spaghetti bolognase at 11:00am on a Sunday morning, so I give them props for that.  Bottomline: this cafe has a friendly, very attentive staff and the food is comprable to the cafes you'll find at Bellagio, Paris or Venetian hotels.
2 ||| In theory I love Rose & Crown: Good people, good beer, good location, etc. \n\nBut sometimes they fail the service test, albeit unintentionally, due to staff and space challenges.\n\nWhen it's not packed and I can enjoy steady service from the pool room or out on the porch, life is just about perfect. However, if I'm jammed inside with 100 other people vying for the same bartender's attention, I kinda want to take my ball and go home.\n\nSo when you go to Rose & Crown, which I enthusiastically suggest you do, temper your expectations based on how busy it is. \n\nAll that said the food is dependable, the beer selection is legit, and it's an ideal place to check out a weekend soccer match or even Sunday NFL football.
0 ||| And by one star mean no stars!  Mediocre ice cream, it's cold and icy, but lacks in creamy deliciousness. The \"bottled water\" is simply tap water in a reused bottle. Total rip off.
4 ||| Wow! Great late night coffee shop! We ordered the cafe latte and the kona mocha frappachino. My husband ordered the teramisu and I was debating on the cheesecake vs the Italian lemon cake. The guy was real helpful in helping me decide. I went with the cheesecake. He mistakingly brought the lemon cake and said no worries keep the lemon cake and brought a cheesecake!!!! I got to have both cakes I wanted for the price of one!!! He was all smiles and pleasant. We will be back for sure ! The service was great and The latte was even better!
4 ||| We ate here 12-25-2012. Just now catching up with all my reviews! This place is fantastic. My daughter son in law and I flew into vegas for xmas and met my dad and step mom here for dinner and it was great. I had the beef wellington which was perfect. Everyone else had some kind of cut of steak and they all loved it. Sorry cant get more specific too much time passing! Service was great too.
4 ||| This place is fantastic! Lots of healthy options from a very knowledgable and friendly staff. I highly recommend the Mock Tacos entree and the curried chickpea salad. The Jamaican Hibiscus iced tea is also to die for.
1 ||| My boss took me here for a really belated birthday lunch. I wasn't really sure if I wanted to eat here due to being overpriced and mediocre reviews, but I figured we should at least give it a chance.\n\nFor appetizer we got deviled eggs which were really good.\n\nI got the Shepard's Pie. It was so bland. I was rather disappointed with that.\n\nMy boss got a sandwich that was essentially two giant pieces of bruschetta. She didn't enjoy that.\n\nMy coworkers got fish and chips and the beef burger. You would think the burger would be just as good as the burgers at Burgr, but it wasn't. \n\nThe service was ridiculously bad. We asked for ketchup and salt, waited forever, finally was able to flag down the waiter again and he said yeah, I'm working on it. Who says that and why would it take so long to get ketchup and salt?? Everyone was trying to eat slow, waiting for the condiments...\n\nThe desert was amazing though. I got the Potted Triple Chocolate Trifle. If I were to go back here, I would just order that desert. And maybe the deviled eggs.
4 ||| I've had two surgeries performed by Dr. Basewitz on two separate discs. I just saw him again and am actually disappointed that he isn't recommending surgery at this time. His past procedures gave me instant relief. \n\nNow I have to see a pain doctor and address the problem in other ways. Aside from being exceptionally pleased with the results of his operations, I find him to be extremely personable and compassionate. I'm really surprised that some people describe him as rude or uncaring.\n\nNot sure why my review was put in the not recommended category, but want to update and say Dr. Bassewitz performed surgery on me yesterday)10/28/2014).\n\n I was legitimately suicidal before the surgery and about 36 hours later am feeling very optimistic about my future in regard to back pain and sciatica (the sciatica is gone). I will update again in the coming days/weeks.
2 ||| Got a \"Suite\" for about $40 for a Monday night (after tax, No Resort Fees!), very roomy.  Couch and TV in one room and a TV in the bed room.  It was a steal on the surface, but no frills.   However, only one TV had a remote (Bed room), no big deal so I told desk clerk at check out a remote was missing, she said no problem.  TV sets were early 90s vintage but got about 30 channels.  Also, walls were thin and you could hear noises at night from people in other rooms so it was tough to sleep. Shower and wash room was basic, not unlike Motel 6.  Can't comment on gambling or food, did neither there, just stayed the night.  No line at all to check in and clerks both check in and check out were very nice.  Only about a 2-minute walk to casino, enter rooms from outdoors.   Not too far from strip or downtown or east side casinos.  Adequate when you don't want to pay strip prices; classic case of you gets what you pays for.
2 ||| While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan.
1 ||| The last few times I have been there the staff has been horrible. The don't pay attention and then when I ask again for them to add something I already asked for they give an attitude. The food isn't that great to have to deal with staff that don't care. Chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food Mexican in Oakland.
3 ||| Here on 4/28/12\n\nDecent food for breakfast . Colorado Omelettes was better than anticipated . Had potroast, bacon ,ham ,sausage , and cheese stuffed into and on top of the omlette. Coffee was ground and brewed here and served in the gold pot kept on our table. Syrup served warm in a clean, non sticky caraf. Very good !
3 ||| Great place to eat! Not only is the food great but the service is also great! I have a hard time finding great service in Asian restaurants. They came around regularly and we didn't feel like they were ignoring us. They also came around and helped with the BBQ from time to time. Their spicy squid and beef tofu soup were a little spicier than I would have liked them to be. I'm not a big fan of this mashed potato side dish they have. I'm definitely a big fan of beef tongue, squid, brisket, Kim chi, and bulgogi.
3 ||| Best place to get a watch battery changed, have your jewelry repaired or buy second hand beautiful and unique jewelry. Don't be fooled by the other jewelers who want to charge you more money if you own a Movado or other high end watch, the competitor's  18-25 dollar batteries don't last any longer  and DO NOT affect the timing! Many Rolex owners discovered this gem of a place. They also have the add a pearl necklaces with the pearls sold separately.\nNancy is a struggling business woman who has a kind heart! Don't be dismayed by the lack of fancy furniture in the shop, the work is quality.
1 ||| The buffet was a disappointment. And i Usually have low expectations for buffets anyways.\nFor a girl who can eat, i found a whole section of food that was literally uneatable. The food not only LOOKED unappetizing, it also tasted that way. \nThe somewhat redeeming quality for the buffet was that the desserts were pretty decent and the rack of lamb was decent. \nOtherwise, the change between meals were SLOW, and the food was generally sub par. If i paid more than 20 dollars, I would have found it to be completely unreasonable. The buffet at Wynn is better.
1 ||| We didn't have a very good experience at Razz's. Maybe Razz wasn't having a good night because he was shouting at one of his staff members at one point and was excruciatingly loud then and with some of the guests at the bar. So, point one; if you're looking for quiet intimate dining, skip Razz's....\n\nMore importantly, the food, especially considering the high prices, was disappointing to say the least. My wife had a fish special (Sea Bass) that was overcooked and dry. The contrast of raw accompanying vegtables made for a terrible combination.\nI had the Bouillabaisse ($29). I'm no chef, but have done enough cooking to know that if you heat shrimp in hot sauce for more than 3 minutes, you get little rubber balls. For some reason, Razz and/or his staff doesn't know this. The only reason for the two stars is that the rest of the dish (mussels/clams that are somewhat resistant to overcooking) including the broth was tasty.\n\nIf it weren't for the groupon that mitigated the bill......I'd Really be upset.\n\nI think there are much better experiences for fine dining in the valley....
4 ||| It's a bar with great burgers!  Love this place and eat there..... probably too often for lunch.\n\nIf you walk in at the lunch-rush do not be disturbed by the line..... it'll be long!  But it also moves quickly.  Service is fast and great.  Generally, by the time I put my order in, get a drink and sit down my burger is delivered within a minute or two.\n\nThe burgers are terrific and they have some of the the best onion rings around.  Fries are great too.\n\nIt can be a bit pricey though..... burger, side, and drink will run you about $10.  Is it worth it..... meh, borderline but I enjoy it enough.
3 ||| Salsa bar alone is worth it.  Awesome artwork is worth it.  Best tacos/burritos are the cactus ones.  Not overpriced.  We love this place.
4 ||| Go see Heather G! She's cut my hair the last few times and I won't go anywhere else .. She does a. Ice scalp massage and uses good styling products.
3 ||| The restaurant space has been revamped, and feels much larger than Nix.  The bar was pushed back, further from the door, leaving ample room for mingling and table seating, and the vibe is hipper too, with tufted leather chairs and low red lighting.\n\nMy favs:  Cowbell Chili & Smoked Cornbread, black bean burger, sweet potato croquettes, which are basically sweet potato donuts balls (or little balls of heaven, as Cowbell calls them), and Dali's fries with garlic aioli, buffalo, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.  \n\nI posted a full review on the blog, but these are the highlights.
1 ||| We had a nice dinner,, but my wife got food posioning..  She woke up 4am and was ill and continued to be ill that day..  Could keep nothing down and very dehiderated.   The management while polite seemed to think I was shaking them down when I asked for a partial discount off our $300 bill..   Rather hard to accept such an event when dining at such a place..  Better luck..
4 ||| Been there 4 times already and Hot n Juicy has not disappoint our family!!!! Awesome service by Myra and Trent and great seafood. We will definitely be back. Great job !!!'
0 ||| First, I have not used their service, but I do thank those that have left reviews regarding that. Rather, today I had a gentleman knocking on doors and offering Armor service. I ignored the technician the first time around (albeit he knew I was home). After he left, I literally printed a \"NO SOLICITING\" sign and stuck it outside on my door because there have been so many door-to-door salesmen in my neighborhood offering stuff. \n\nTo my surprise, a few hours later the technician stopped by again and knocked on my door, as well as rang the door bell. He totally ignored the sign, which is completely disrespectful in my opinion. However, I thought he may have something important to tell me so I opened the door. Ironically, the same \"trucks in the neighborhood\" spiel was used with me (other reviews have mentioned this and it does actually happen). He told me, \"We've gotten a few calls about our trucks being in your neighborhood so we're going around to let people know that we will be in the area for the next couple days...\" That's odd, I thought, I have yet to see such a truck. He then starts writing down all the \"info I need to know\" in case I may consider getting serviced while they're in the neighborhood. Apparently, I am the only one looking at the sign I literally posted a few hours before. \n\nIn short, no, \"Scott,\" I do not want your service. The whole experience was completely rude and disrespectful! And based on the reviews that have been posted, I think people have a clear picture of what kind of company Armor is.
1 ||| FAIL!\n\nI've been to a couple different Brazilian churrascaria's before and this was probably the worst that I've had.  I expect more from Vegas.  Perhaps it was that we were having a late lunch and were in between their lunch and dinner meats, but this assumption still doesn't make up for the poor tasting food, horrible service, and price.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe restaurant itself looks great and has a nice ambiance.  The bar has several drink selections to choose from as well as you wait.  The restaurant is hidden between a couple others within the Miracle Mile shops located in Planet Hollywood, and to me can stay hidden.\n\nFood:\nWe had a party of 4.  3 had the meat plates and I had the mix plate of both meat and seafood.  I was in the mood for some good surf and turf!  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.\n\nAs with most typical Brazilian churascarias an all you can eat buffet style bar was available for salads, side dishes, and appetizers.  The selection was not too bad with some pasta salad, rice, beans, and even fried banana.  This banana was probably my favorite treat of the meal.\n\nThe meat I found to be very dry.  We sampled all the meats from the filet to the sausage and none of them blew my mind or were exceptionally good.  The filet mignon was the best one by far and was not a great as most steak houses.\n\nThe seafood comes all at 1 time with 3 bacon-wrapped scallops, 3 grilled shrimps, a piece of salmon, and a piece of fried fish.  You have to specifically ask for more of the seafood from your waitress, but more on that later.  The flavors were ok for the salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  Just not phenomenal.\n\nService:\nWe were greeted upon entering with a smile and that's always a plus.  We were then offered a tour of the kitchen.  Sure why not...the tour is nothing to jump at as you take a few steps through a small corridor into the kitchen and see all the meats cooking above a vat of fatty grease.  This alone should of killed my appetite, but then again I'll pretty much eat anything at anytime.  I guess they wanted to show how cool the cooking process was???  Or maybe they want you to be grossed out so you don't eat as much?\n\nHere is the biggest gripe the service from the waitress.  She took forever to just take our orders.  The food then took even longer to come out.  I thought that meat would come and go until we had to \"tap out\" due to over consumption.  No it came every few minutes or so as my belly filled with side dishes.  We specifically requested the filet mignon on 3 separate occasions and it seemed to come out just as the check came out...I'm on to your cost savings plan!\n\nPrice:\nWe were given the lunch menu as we sat a little before 3PM and the plates are slightly cheaper than the dinner menu.  But of course when the bill came we were charged the dinner prices.  We quickly mentioned it to the waitress that gave us slight attitude before changing the prices back.\n\nLunch price is fair.\n\nSuch high expectations and such a let down...
4 ||| This location has been under new ownership and very well run now. The place is very clean, customer service has been top notch, and they have been more than generous with their toppings. I'll visit again and again.
4 ||| Loved it! I got the Mac n cheese burger and it was out of this world insanely awesome! Burger, bacon, cheese and Mac and cheese...how could u not love it. My hubby got fish tacos and they were awesome. You must get bloody Mary's to drink!
0 ||| I park outside on the street of Panera so I could run in and grab a bite to eat.  Well, I didn't have quarters, and when I asked the girl at the counter if I could exchange my dollar for 4 quarters so I could feed the meter while I ate, she looked at me like I was crazy and said \"I can't give you change.\"  ..... How the hell am I supposed to park and eat if I do not have change and you are unwilling to exchange a dollar for me.  I know it might be company policy to not open the register, but do not roll your eyes at me and get an attitude.  Gracias para nada.
1 ||| I would give STK in Vegas 5 stars but they have the worst customer service so 2stars for them. Blonde chick that checked our RSVP was a snob... Really bitch get a real job. Make sure to have the entire party present otherwise the last person to arrive won't be able to order her food and will just have to share with the others. The waiter rushed us and asked \"are you done now?\" Didn't ask if we wanted to take any food to go and just grabbed our plates while one of my friend was still eating. So we took our time to order and eat desserts and left 10% tip instead of 20% on 400$ tab. No need to be rude when you're making minimum wage, idc if you're busy, they shouldn't have booked 100 ppl in a 50ppl max capacity room. \n\nOther than the horrible customer service, food here is delicious!
1 ||| I do not normally write reviews but I am so mind blogged about what happened last night that I have to write this. \n \n(Pros: The Greek Salad and The Milo Special.)\n\nThe Greek Salad: It was surprisingly great! It was a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and onions, that was accompanied by feta cheese and dressed with a vinaigrette. It was very delicious, if you like the tomatoes. If you don't, I would skip it. \n\nThe Milo Special:  At least this is what I think it is called. It was zucchini and eggplant that was lightly fried and had a yogurt dipping with it. That was the highlight of the night. \n\n(Meh: The Calamari and The Wine)\n\nThe Calamari: It was a little chewy. I didn't really care for it. \n\nThe Wine: It was sweet, but I could stomach it. \n\n(Cons: The Service/Staff and The Fish, The Atmosphere, and The Steak Fries)\n\nLet's Start with the food: The Fish was okay. It was basically red snapper with capers, lemon, and olive oil. It was okay, but I had better. It would be in the meh section, but it was 200 dollars. For 200 dollar fish, it better knock my socks off. Also,  it had bones in it. \nThe steak fries were awful. There was no seasoning or anything there and they were soggy. \n\nThe atmosphere: It was was so loud in this place. I couldn't hear anything. We had a large party and couldn't hear half of the conversation. It was very loud. \n\nThe service and staff: They were slow. We arrived at 7:30 didn't leave until 11 or so. Plus, when I asked them to explain a few items on the menu they couldn't adequately explain things to me. (that is if you can hear anything in this place) They are also business people. They like to deceive you here.  \nWe asked for water, they bring us bottled water that they charge 8 dollars a pop for. We asked for fish, they tell us that it can't feed a group of our size, and adds lamb, which is another 200 dollars. (I didn't eat the lamb that is why is it not on here). Its not the prices that were the problem, it was the fact that they deceived us and ranked up the bill. We had eight people and they added 18 percent gratitude on the bill which is probably why he was making a lot of the suggestions.  I rather you be upfront with me about the prices and let me make the choice if I wanted to eat there or not. This is the type of thing that is admired there, and it is a shame. I will not be dining there anymore. But needless to say, we were blindsided by the bill and took about 30 minutes to figure out, which they complained about. It was ridiculous. Never again will I eat there for some mediocre fish.  I had better fish for a 1/20 of that price. Real disappointment.
4 ||| My boyfriend and I were apartment hunting in Ohio for a week and Brenda was an enormous help in taking care of Mo and Mew. She came to our home, even though it was a little out of her service area, and made sure the girls were fed, walked, and played with. Brenda is fast on her feet and even noticed some things that we had forgotten to take care of before we left. Her communication skills are awesome and I felt like I knew what was going on at home while I was away. She even sent me a text on one of the first days of her visits to let me know that Mo and Mew were doing great. I really feel like my fur kids couldn't have been placed in better hands.
1 ||| I really dislike this place. I came here only once on sale day. It was packed full of people. Stuff was thrown all over the place. It was difficult to walk down isles. \n\nThe furniture section was garbage. Seriously just full of broken things.\n\nI didn't look at any clothes because you could not walk down the idles without stepping all over clothes.\n\nThe home section was better.. they dd have some cool stuff over there. I was able to purchase a few things that have been helpful and I did find a vintage juicer. I had been looking for 1 for a few months. \n\nI like movies.. I watch them often. Craft, sew, play with my son, and watch movies. The selections was pretty small here... no problem... but they had 2 Resident Evil  movies! They happened to be the 2 I did not have yet.  I'm cheap so I was super excited! The cases looked beautiful! Popped them open to make sure the movie wasn't too scratched up.... GONE! They were both gone! :( So sad. \n\nThis won't be a store I will make it a point to go to
1 ||| Barrio is known for overpriced food and drinks. I have used to go to the original Barrio location a lot and watch the prices rise big time over the years. $11 for a dessert. The Barrio Queen has the same concept. Overpriced f&b. Don't get me wrong, I know that the food quality is good, but there are a lot of better and comparable restaurants available that's a lot easier on the wallet.
0 ||| I ordered $65 headphones on Amazon.  Three days ago OnTrac marked it as delivered.  My BF, who was home at the alleged time of delivery, never received the package.  Our address lists our apartment number, and the driver could have easily buzzed our number and he would have let the driver inside to put it somewhere safe, but instead the driver either A) left it outside our building which is street level and it was stolen OR B) they kept it for themselves.  Either way it was marked as delivered with no attempt to contact us.\n\nThis company is TERRIBLE and Amazon should cease using them immediately.  I am outraged that this is so commonplace with this company and Amazon still uses them.
0 ||| Would give them zero if I could.  Employees seem to happy to be miserable and treat customers like they are five year old.  Service is non-existent, place looks like a 70's basement with vintage TV and I refuse to use them again.\n\nThis seems to be the go to location for area car dealers when rentals are needed and i will not do it again.  I will ride my bike instead of using them.
1 ||| I preface by saying: we wanted to like this place. We can bike to it, it's family-friendly and did i mention that it's close? It is busy even before 6pm. Parking is only achieved through luck or valet. Kudos to word getting out about Arcadia Tavern. But...\n\nREVIEW\nUninspired bar food in a clean, open, friendly atmosphere. Lack of imagination is clear in the tired sports grill theme - aging fratboy paradise. Might as well be a chain. Then the execution might be tighter. The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order. Almost looked like the pizza in the Nutrisystem commercials - undercooked and topped with processed items.\n\nFish n' Chips usually deserve their own paragraph. These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:\n\nFish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk. \n\nAnatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop. \n\nTots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces. Fast food can even pull this off - the Taco John Potato Ol\u00e9 for example. These were more like greasy, fried mash potatoes. And salty. I'm not drunk enough for this.\n\nI want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream \"short-term, dabbling in the industry business model\".\n\nWill update after another visit. Maybe.
1 ||| As you descend the two flights from Mandalay Bay's main concourse to Aureole you are stuck by the tower of wine in the center of the staircase, a promise this Michelin rated place will be worth  the price.  Reception is more efficient than welcoming and you are soon escorted to your table.  For such an apparently sophisticated locale dress is remarkably casual.  My coat and tie were in the minority, as was my touch of gray hair.  We have been there twice and both times the clientele was predominantly 20 and 30-somethings and in shirt sleeves and fashionable jeans.  Ask for a table in the back near the waterfall and swan pond.\n\nThe wine list is indeed impressive, but is presented on what must be the original pad computer.  It requires a stylus, is balky and is as non-intuitive as can be.  Come with an idea of what wine you want and insist the sommelier operate the damn thing for you before she slips away.   Service overall was excellent though it was Valentine's Day evening and the place was packed.\n\nWe both ordered fish, perhaps not the specialties of the house.  The swordfish in citrus with vegetables was beautifully presented.  The root vegetables were partially peeled with the skins tied into butterfly wings.  The fish was only good by comparison.  The red snapper, characterized by our waiter as flaky, was under cooked and flavorless.  It was presented on a bacon infused bed of vegetables that were much better than the fish.  The side of root vegetables was uniquely spiced and delicious.\n\nThe star of the meal was the onion soup, presented under a pastry shell the waiter cut open.  Excellent.  For such a highly rated restaurant the evening was disappointing.
0 ||| I ate at the to go stand in the terminal, and it was awful. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, and I got a stale bagel with one small thing of cream cheese and nothin to spread it around.
4 ||| There has been mix reviews regarding this little showcase, however I think it was well worth the visit.  First of all, we were seated promptly and immediately were told about the special, prix fix, and recommendations. Since it was Valentines Day, the service was a bit slow, but my date and I didn't mind since we had a 9:30 show at La Reve.\n\nWe started with a glass of borduex recommended by our sommelier.  The price was reasonable and the taste was suttle and not overpowering to the palatte.  For our entr\u00e9e, I had the duo of beef with black truffle/celery pur\u00e9e and my girlfriend had the steak frites with onion compote.  First of all the duo of beef was amazing.  The meat was just melting in my mouth and the celery pur\u00e9e along with the black truffle just made the dish blossom.  Although the portion was small, I recommend getting a starter or salad.  My girlfriend's dish was also delicious. The onion compote brought a different flare to the steak, and unlike some places it was cooked to perfection.\n\nAfter our dinner, we got dessert.  The apple crisp tart served with cinnemon icecream.  It was good but nothing too fancy.  I would have expected more, but sine it was valentines day, we also recieved a variety of desserts along with what we ordered.\n\nThe only thing I could really complain about was the random loud music playing ever so often due to the waterfall show right outside he restaurant.  Other than that, I would definitely go back, but not on a regular basis.
1 ||| Meh. Went here for lunch with my colleagues after our annual department planning meeting.  Our server was far from welcoming, my boss had a long hair floating at the top of her beverage and my salad was mediocre.  One of my colleagues asked if she could have the gluten free crust option for a lunch pizza and the server unapologetically told her that it's only for the larger pizzas.  Really?  You can't accommodate a different crust for a smaller size?  Kudos to them for having vegetarian ingredients like tempeh, but I think that there are much better dining establishments on Mill.
2 ||| I give this Tommy's 3 stars only because it was clean and the employees are nice. We didn't care for the food at all. Maybe when back when we were kids or teens this food would have been better.
0 ||| H&M clothes are wonderful to keep up with the trends at a very inexpensive budget.\n\n However, just be prepared to deal with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! The fitting room attendants are like stones lacking any kind of personality or social skills. The rest of the staff acted like I was bothering them if I needed help finding something and the lady that checked me out was on the phone while she rung up my $380 purchase. She messed up on the ringing and had to start all over because she was distracted on the phone. I suggested she call the person back so she could concentrate on ringing me up properly and she rolled her eyes. There were 4 customers behind me just as angry at her. HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Where are the managers or the corporate people to come in and do a clean wipe- out? Re-hire a whole new crew so H&M can be a good experience and not a horrid one!
4 ||| Awesome burgers!! Delicious and made to order. Drinks are on point. Cute bar ambiance with friendly customer service and managers greeted me with a smile. For a bar, it will exceed expectations and the beer and burgers won't disappoint you.
4 ||| I honestly have never gotten my nails done at Polished and not that I want to write a review about waxing- but all I can say is Hayley is fabulous-quick and professional. I have visited here for six years and will continue to. Tips in cash or check only.
4 ||| Best all you can eat around!
1 ||| Got there right at opening time and seated at the bar area where the bartender was our waiter .  He was so distracted he forgot to place our order.  One hour later the pizza came out. You have to eat it with A fork because it's soupy. Not an enjoyable experience
4 ||| If you want #Waxing when in #Vegas this is the best place! Got a #BrazilianWax smooth as a baby! Very sanitary clean place.  Loved the friendly, accommodating staff. Definitely going back! Thanks The Birthday Suit
0 ||| I have come to this location four separate times to set up an account. After being sent away for not having made an appointment the second time I should have learned my lesson but I was told most days I wouldn't need one. It's next door to my work but the convenience just isn't worth the attitude of the tellers.
4 ||| went here last week with friends & it was amazing. had a gr8 time. great food, great drinks, excellent atmosphere, and awesome time. i would like to bring my husband here for date night.
2 ||| There's a lot to like about Essence:\n\nThe food here is really good.  Sometimes the portions are a bit small, but the taste is always there.  Same thing goes for their coffee, too, always fantastic and a great way to wake up... a little caffeine buzz balanced out with a breakfast bagel.  MMMM!  \n\nTheir macaroons are really fucking good, too.  I like the tiny ones.  I like miniature things, I dunno.  I like tiny chickens.  I like itty-bitty little cars.  If I could get away with it, I would shrink myself to be about 8 inches tall... but I read a Bukoswki story that made me change my mind.\n\nI don't come here as much as I'd like to because the place is always so over-crowded it's a pain in the ass.  That means they're doing well and I'm glad that they are, but sometimes I like to eat in peace.  Essence is always humming with thirty different conversations going on and clanking plates and clinking dishes.  It's not a very comfy place if you've been out drinking the night before.\n\nAs I said before, depending on what you order, the portions can be a bit small.  I'm fine with that, I think Americans, as a general rule, eat way more than they should and we've been spoiled by such large portions.  So I agree with the portion-sizes here, absolutely, but sometimes it can be a bit expensive if you want a breakfast sandwich.  It's a bit silly to spend close to $10 and get like this small-sized little guy with a single strip of ham.  The food always tastes really good, but it's still overpriced.\n\nThere's a lot to like and I'm glad that they're around and functioning and doing very well for themselves.  I have a few gripes, I guess.  I desperately want a fantastic breakfast place in Tempe but Essence is overpriced and too goddamn loud, Harlow's gives me diarrhea and... what's left?  IHOP?  Denny's?
2 ||| This is another one of those restaurants where I'm stuck between 3 and 4 stars, just wishing Yelp would create a 1/2 star option...so we'll go ahead and round down to 3 stars just because of a few minor details. \n\nHad reservations at 9:15 on a Friday night and we were seated promptly at a table by the kitchen (unfortunately, we were extremely far from the windows for a view of the water show). Let me also say that I really despise circuses...but loved the decor in this restaurant. Five stars for that. \nWe requested just normal tap water and the wait staff seemed almost annoyed with this selection. Uh, sorry we're not sorry that we won't spend $9 for bottled water? Give us a break. This lead to infrequent refills of our water-- that's a big negative for me as I am the polar opposite of a camel and drink water like I won't have any again for a week. Okay, enough of that rant...\n\nPLUS: We had some delicious salads. A prosciutto & melon salad and the classic Caprese. Big props for these two!\n\nThe bread: Yess, we were fans. One of them tasted like pan pizza crust..the whole table agreed. So good! \n\nMeals:\n--Pappardelle: Wide noodles served with sausage and wild mushrooms. I was looking so forward to this dish, and I think it only fell short in my eyes because of its sauce-- or, rather, its lack thereof. There was NO sauce, just an almost excessive amount of melted butter covering the dish. It was good, but almost a tad bland. My mom and sister enjoyed this dish, though. \n\n--\"Mama Egi's\" ravioli: Either order this as an appetizer, or split this and another dish with someone else at the table. Extremely delicious, but also extremely rich. I couldn't eat more than four or five of these mini raviolis without wanting to stop because it was so rich. \n\n--Quail. I had never had quail before, and my sister's boyfriend ordered this dish. I only had a bite, but I liked what I tasted. He said it was better than what he was used to. \n\nDessert:\nWe ordered the bombolonis (donuts)-- ooh, sugar-covered goodness. Came with a raspberry sauce and a strong chocolate sauce. \n\nOverall, Circo wasn't bad. It wasn't bad at all. It had its strong points, but also fell short in some areas. I'm willing to pay my share of money for food in Vegas, and this wasn't cheap- which is fine, but it could have been much better. I personally prefer Stratta over at Wynn.
3 ||| Excellent!\nI love the ambiance of this restaurant. We were seated next to window with a peek of the fountain show. Foie grois was great and hamachi was good. I ordered medium duck. Unfortunately it was not seasoned well & was too chewy. Server was in tuned & offered to exchange dish for a sea bass. It was delicious!
4 ||| I broke my iphone 5S screen last week end and these guys fixed my phone in just 20mins. They have the lowest price in town. Great job wireless phone doctors! Im referring you to every one i know that has a broken phone. :)
0 ||| Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.
4 ||| Extremely knowledgeable baristas paired with high quality coffee result in the best cup of coffee Madison has to offer.\n\nI love the fact that they specialize in pour over coffee.  So much so that I actually hate having to drink drip anywhere else.  \n\nIn addition to the life changing brew, they offer fresh bakery from Batchhouse and small, but delicious food menu.  The Beef Brisket breakfast sandwich will melt in your mouth.\n\nIn addition to coffee and food JPH offers up craft beers, and a wine selection.  Add to that free wifi, books, board games, open mic night, a doggie friendly dish out front, and Johnson Public is the place to chill.
0 ||| \"It's a manufacturer problem, not a dealership problem.\"  That's what I was told by\nGeneral Sales Manager, Ken Welsh during a phone conversation after posting my one star rating of the dealership on YELP earlier this month.  Mr. Welsh told me that there is really nothing he can do about the defective and poorly performing 2013 SRX which I bought from Arrowhead Cadillac in May, adding that my wife and I should just \"enjoy the car.\"   Quite condescending, wouldn't you say?  Would you want to buy an automobile plagued with problems from a dealership, only to be told that  that \"It is a manufacturer problem, not a dealership problem?   I think not.  THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING A VEHICLE FROM ARROWHEAD CADILLAC.   2 THUMBS DOWN.
3 ||| Love it! Sundays are crazy. I've never seen so many beautiful women in one spot at a time. Ay karumba
2 ||| I rarely come into this CVS location, but when I do it's an OK experience.  Was in the area and stopped by the other day to pick up some Dark Chocolate Candy for the Better Half.....she loves the Dove Dark Chocolates and they have them at CVS.  Fast checkout and clean store....what more could I ask for?\n\nReturn Factor - 50%
3 ||| I came to the Jean Georges Steakhouse for a group dinner hosted by some guys with whom my firm does a lot of business.  The menu had been preselected with one table-wide appetizer, and three to five choices of soup/salad, entree and dessert.  All of the choices appear on the regular menu. \n\nThe table started with the chilled seafood platter, with an awesome selection of oysters, shrimp, crab claws and crab legs. There were multiple cocktail and other sauces - I'm sure this appetizer cost a fortune, but it was truly extraordinary. \n\nI chose the Burrata Mozzarella (salad), with tomato, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish. \n\nHow disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.\n\nMy dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent. \n\nTwo comments on the service. While it was fantastic overall (they were cool when we lingered after closing time), it was annoying when the staff kept asking whether I was having flat or sparkling water, and then when one didn't ask somebody topped off my flat water with sparkling water - not cool. Then it was annoying when a photographer cajoled us into taking a souvenir photo of the table. Then she wanted $20 for each print.  Really guys?  At Jean Georges?\n\nOverall the dinner was great, and special thanks go to our hosts. Great place.
0 ||| OK... So I went to this place today with a friend because of the yelp reviews.  Well...today is the last day.   The owner is rude, the sandwiches (I had meatball) were tasteless, and the side (4 bean salad) was also tasteless.  I think you will see another similar review for today from the person I came with.  The meatballs looked raw inside and when I asked the owner shunned me and said, \"It's because of the sauce.\"  I think not.  I am Italian and cook meatballs all the time.  The sauce doesn't make the meat look raw, raw meat makes the meat look raw!  We went at noon.  the place was empty, although a few people did come in for take out.  The Yelp site said \"waitress service\" which is wrong.  You order and they drop it off at your table.  The over they use to bake the subs is a large \"toaster oven\" not even a real pizza oven.  I'm not sure what \"Brooklyn\" this guy is from, but the one I know would slap him if they ate at his place.  Sorry... I think the previous reviews were from family...  As for me.  I will move on.
1 ||| I was very disappointed base on all the good reviews. The food was ok ( baked potato was cold) I feel the dining room is poorly managed as most of the tables needed bussing which required us to wait 20 min. Service was very slow and had to ask multiple times for bread and water. Hate to say this but Outback is MUCH better. Will probably never return or recommend to friends
1 ||| Montreal is a great and vibrant city but PET Airport is cramped, dated, dark, and congested.  Its too bad that everyone gave up on Mirabel Airport.
3 ||| Never been to Philadelphia nor have I ever been to a whole lot of places that sells cheesesteak sandwiches. But this place reminds me of a place in Tucson called Frankies South Philadelphia Cheesesteak.  \n\nFrom my understanding this place used to be located on 5th Ave which they've relocated to Craftsman Ct in Old Town Scottsdale. The new location has three times the space than the original one. Still open 24 hours a day, it's probably the only place you can get a Philly cheesesteak at 3 am.\n\nThe GF had bought a Groupon to this place awhile back and finally decided to take me here (feel so lucky). I ordered a regular 9 inch Cheese-steak with whiz cheese and a side of fresh cut fries (oh if you check in here, you'll get a free basket of fries with your order). Within 5 minutes or so our order arrived - and just as fast as the food came out it was gone!  The bread was nice and soft and the steak was full of favor! \n\nThis place is awesome! The only thing that bugged me was trying to find a parking space. Holly hell I think we were driving around for hours! Ok Ok maybe not hours but it sure seems like it (hungry status). \n\nLove this place and will hopefully be back soon. \nKCYE
4 ||| I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\n\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either.
2 ||| Ever see that movie \"Zombieland\"? Or \"The Road Warrior\"? It's kinda like that. Oh, remember that song \"The freaks come out at night?\" That's not the case here. It's pretty trippy. There's a whole crowd of goths, punk rockers and... movie characters like Spiderman walking around. You can definately tell that you're not on the strip anymore. I even spotted a mini-Mr. T standing around. There are more artists and knick-knack pagodas spread out as well. It's cool to see the people overhead zip-lining across the length of the experience. And then of course there's the hot and trashy women dancing on the outside bars and on the gaming tables inside the casinos. Not so cool is the one stage where apparently anyone can go up and pretend they are Wayne Newton and sing karaoke style all day long. I guess there's a reason why it's called the Freemont Street \"Experience\". \n\nBecause it certainly is.
2 ||| To me, this is a pretty average branch of Crazy Mocha in the city. Located in the heart of Squirrel Hill on Murray where the parking is a nightmare, this is a good place to take a pit stop on a day of shopping in the neighborhood, after a move at the Manor, or to just sit and work for a bit. To be honest, I wasn't too excited about this branch opening up here, mostly because there are other coffee and tea shops in the area I assumed would be negatively impacted by the business brought in here. That being said, this place is objectively a nice shop, bigger than the average Crazy Mocha and I would argue one that has a little less character. Had a few blips with the internet while here, but overall I'd recommend a stop in here sometime.
3 ||| We walked right into the Griffin with no cover on a Friday night. The place was packed and alive with energy. Unfortunately it was a little too packed for us to stay too long. No seats were left and we wanted to to hang out somewhere and catch up with some friends. We'll definitely be back so I can give it a all night of drinking stamp of approval.
2 ||| It's been a while since I've been to this Taco Bell.  I dropped in for lunch yesterday and had great service from the cashier Juan.  He was friendly, patient, and made sure the order was correct.  He also made recommendations to customers on the combo menu if it saved them money or if there was a similar items that they might be interested in.  He should be recognized for his effort as most fast food employees don't give a **** about their job or customers.\n\nMy food came out fast and accurate.  I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.  The only knock on it was that the Bean Burritos were messy.  When they wrapped them, they got red Sauce all over the outside of it...so the Sauce got on my hands.  Oh well, that happens sometimes during the busy lunch rush.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%
0 ||| We never knew this place existed despite frequent trips to smith's! Stumbled upon it on Friday and went in for lunch on Saturday. My family and I were excited to see a southern food joint not far from home. \nOur order:\nBBQ pork sandwich with fries and slaw on the side\nBBQ pork lunch with Mac n cheese and collard greens\nBBQ brisket lunch with fried okra and ???\nSadly disappointed, so much I can't remember what the other side was on \n1. Food was either dry, salty, and most of all BBQ meat had no smoky flavor and not enough bbq sauce. I'm not even \n1 who likes a lot of sauce, but food needed it.
2 ||| Not as good as champagne's but it will do. Went for a friend.  Not feeling the karaoke.  So we left for better entertainment.  There was only one bartender,  but he was awesome.  The dude running the karaoke was funny.  But we aren't really karaoke people so we left for greener pastures.  If you like dive bats with cheep, good drinks then head over.
0 ||| Well. We went here.\n\nWe were greeted by 2 peppy and upbeat cute 20something girls. We were expecting that to be the case when we were sat.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nI am not lying one bit when I say, we waited 18 minutes and not ONE person came to greet us, serve us water or even acknowledge us.\n\nWe left after waiting 18 minutes for someone to come over. When we walked out the same 2 girls said, \"bye, thanks for coming. How was everything?\"\n\nI literally walked out the door with my friend as our other friend filed a complaint.\n\nThey did NOTHING to get us back to eat there, NOTHING.\n\nThis happened around 2-3PM this past Sunday, 7/9/2012.
3 ||| This (and Smith's) is my family's go-to grocery store. We come here every weekend whenever my mom feels like making Asian food at home. It has a nice variety of Asian products ranging from Chinese to Filipino and everything in between, which is nice since we won't have to go to multiple locations. We used to go to 99 Ranch but ever since we moved farther out west, this place is very convenient. \n\nI love going from aisle to aisle just to discover new items to try. From hair products to junk food, even new tea to drink. When I was making pho from scratch, I was able to buy every detailed ingredients in one place. They are complete with lots of herbs and spices, sauces, powders, you name it! Their facility is also very clean. If you end up having a language problem with an employee, it won't be hard to find someone who can speak English. I'm pretty sure majority of them can speak English anyway. \n\nAnd I love their bakery/deli selections. I buy the pastries to bring for lunch, and I like to order their dim sum whenever I'm craving them but wouldn't want to go to Orchid's Garden or Chang's by myself. Their deli items are pretty good for the price. Instead of going to Panda Express, I'd advice you to go here instead. It's authentic and very affordable (roughly $5 for 2 combo), and their servings are HUGE.\n\nPlus, they have a FREE fish-frying service!
1 ||| Not the best place to dine at. If you want to watch sports, they have alot of TVs but there are better places to go. Also, very smoky environment. I got a headache from staying there too long. I tried their all you can eat fish and chips....its mediocre. I rather pay a little extra for better quality.
3 ||| LOVE Classic Italian Pizza. I don't ever really crave pizza, but this is fantastic. My fave is the Sole Mio, which has ham, mushrooms, and a fried egg. It's not on the menu anymore, but they will make it if you ask for it.\n\nGreat service, prompt and friendly. Warm, comfortable restaurant. Great place for a date with someone you have been dating for a while. \n\nThe only complaint would be the salads. They aren't terrible, but they aren't amazing either. If you're looking for an appetizer, the Brick Oven Bread or the proscuitto wrapped asparagus is a better option.
2 ||| Attended the Champagne brunch on Saturday, $24 a person for basically all the free mimosas on top of the normal buffet.  And it was quite a normal buffet, even if it was a very vast array of meal selection.  \n\nThe desserts are amazing, the little stripe-rolled selection of cakes are perfect and moist.  Their mimosas were pretty delicious and were constantly refreshed by a roving crew with pitchers.  The selection was a major plus too, and there were several major stations with live people actively making you omelettes, mongolian BBQ, or carving you a giant shank of prime rib.  No complaints about the variety.\n\nBut certainly about the quality of food -- yes, it's a buffet, and the rigors of long and heated mass-quantity portions means you aren't going to get Mario Batali quality, but more often than not the food came up cold by the time you got back to your seat,  or in the case of most of the Asian noodles,  overdrenched with oil and inedible.   The crab legs were, well, sub-par.\n\nBut there were plenty of dishes and we all felt we'd gotten our money's worth at the end of it, for good and for bad.  I certainly would call it the biggest selection near the Strip, but not the best.
2 ||| First visit tried the 8oz bt bacon cheeseburger.  When asked what temp I wanted I thought I hit the jackpot.  It's so nice to order a burger the way I liked it, which in medium rare.  Unfortunately, if only the burger arrived at that temp.  Burger was more med well.  Very disappointing.  When I was ordering and watching the kid smash the burgers on the flat top I had a suspicion that the burger would arrive over cooked. Bacon was thick and tasty. Not overcooked.  Cheddar cheese was lacking in flavor.  Could barely taste it.    Usually I would send it back but I was hungry and didn't have time to waste.  Tater tots were crispy and cooked perfectly.  Nice and crispy and not over greasy.  Servers were around constantly to check on drink refills.  BT's is the only burger joint in the area so they will do well.  I'll go back and hopefully they can train their cooks a little better.
2 ||| Way too over priced. I mean its great food. With an average sized portion. But for how much I'm paying?... Not totally worth it!
3 ||| Love Em' new ownership, better atmosphere!\n\nFood is always tasty!
1 ||| This place has great sushi in a nice atmosphere. Very busy full of people and is open late at night. Their service has never been that great but the past few times I've been. There have been big problems with service and the last time I was totally ignored. It sucks because I like going to this place by my house. But like I said, I'm not going there again to let them treat me like I'm not an important customer.
4 ||| I took my 2 dogs here for the vaccination clinic.  The price is great and the wait on a Friday afternoon was around 20-25 minutes which I think is terrific for a walk-in shot clinic.  The staff was very friendly to both me and my 2 dogs and even though they were quick, I felt they were still thorough, getting their weight, asking questions about their health, comforting each dog before giving them the shots and informing me on the required vaccines and timelines.
0 ||| Colleagues and myself had lunch here before leaving PHX a few days ago...we walked in to find only a couple of tables occupied -that might have been the first clue, however it was already around 12:30 pm on a Thursday so we gave them the benefit of the doubt on that one.\n\nThe hostess turned out to also be the waitress and the bartender because apparently there was no one else around. It took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to order drinks, then it took another 15 minutes before they showed up, and that was after I told her we were on a tight deadline to get to the airport.\n\n We ordered the fried pickles as appetizers - HORRIBLE barely describes them. They had been fried earlier and apparently stuck in the microwave to warm up because the coating was rubbery and greasy. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich - 2 small pieces of grilled chicken with barely a smear of buffalo sauce, the fries - no exaggeration here, had clearly been fried earlier and dunked in oil again. They were oil soaked and dark and definitely not fresh.\n\nThe only item that looked vaguely decent was the Quinoa salad, however, one of the girls didn't get her shrimp with it as she ordered and it wasn't until she was done eating that they showed up - they were kind enough not to charge us for them.\n\nOverall very disappointing  - service was lacking, food was bad, not a place I ever plan to set foot in again.  I think Dierks should probably stick to music and leave the food to someone else!
1 ||| Same as the first review.  It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes.
0 ||| Do not buy from here!! I bought a set of tires and rims from this place and they claimed to have a warranty. Not even 9 months later all 4 of my sidewalls are cracked! They said they would send them to the manufacturer, but the most they have ever given someone was $120.00 for a credit for all 4 tires. They now want another $600 for more tires. What a rip off!
2 ||| My husband and I stopped in before we went to see a movie. We had already had dinner so we only stopped in for a cocktail and some deserts. \n\nWe sat on the patio which was really nice. We were the only ones sitting at the patio, so we were worried that we would be forgotten about but the service was still rather good.\n\nHe had a beer and I had a frozen strawberry margarita. The margarita was slightly watered down and could have used a bit more strawberry to it. My husband tried a beer called Victoria which actually wasn't bad at all. I also ordered a frozen ice cream. I went with the vanilla ice cream. The presentation was lovely and I enjoyed the deep fried ice cream. \n\nI did hit up the bathroom before we headed out to the theater and I was very impressed with the bathroom. The women's bathroom has a large full sized mirror and the handicapped/nursing bathroom is very large and has ton of room. \n\nOverall, it was a nice experience and we may end up going back for dinner on our next date night.
3 ||| Really really great service.  Diverse menu.  Apps are excellent especially the calamari  which features some interesting use of lime.  Nice atmosphere.
3 ||| I love pizza and have to say this place is awesome!! Worth the drive if you dont live close. It isnt your ordinary pizza place. The dough is amazing.....I have visited twice and both times have been very please with food and service.\n\nOnly reason why I didnt give it 5 stars is because it is cash only. There is an atm machine....but I personally like the convenience of using my debit card at POS.\n\nI will definitely be back. Cant wait to try the baked ziti!!
1 ||| I honestly cant believe I paid $30.00 for my lunch here today. I'm used to home made Italian food, so my standards may be a little high, but I would expect a place that specializes in meatballs to actually have good....uh...meatballs. I ordered the chicken meatballs and they tasted like theyd be sitting under a lamp. I expect this from mcdonalds, but I dont expect this when I'm paying 30.00 for my lunch. The meatballs were super dry, and if my 80 year old grandmother can make better meatballs something is wrong. The pasta came out cold, and the broccoli was under cooked. I shouldnt have to saw into my broccoli that Im cutting down a tree. The food wasnt the only problem. The wait staff was rude,the busboy kept giving me dirty looks because I have my 11 month old son with me in the high chair. Of course he was getting food everywhere, but I fully intended on cleaning up after him. I didnt appreciate the death looks while I was eating. Get over it, it's a shopping mall that your customers are coming from, there will be babies. Just hope you get the moms like me that clean up after there kids. Im really mad to that after we paid my friend was feeding her baby and they took all our drinks away and everything out from under us without even asking, as if to say get the f out. Excuse us for taking an extra fifteen minutes. Your restaurant was empty, nobody was waiting. To top it off, one of the waiters tells us that their restrooms dont have changing tables and to go somewhere in the mall to change them. Then we walk back to their bathrooms and there is a changing table. Im pretty sure the people at this place just hate babies. Which I can respect the fact for a nice evening meal maybe not bring babies, but it was 2pm and lunch time. This place is horrible compared to the other restaurants that are available in the same location. Say no and walk over to Yardhouse.
4 ||| I've dealt w/ Mr. Kearns numerous times and he is a polite and straight to the point agent. Gavish employees and associates are polite and helpful people that I've ever met since my transactions w/ them started and closed. This Company is FABULOUS compare to other companies I've dealt with. I referred several clients to them who are also very happy and will continue to do so.
3 ||| I have never been to Firehouse Subs before but I would definitely come back! I got the vegetarian combo with a DELICIOUS cherry, vanilla Dr. Pepper and some jalapeno Vicki's chips. I love that they have the soda machine with over 100 options... \nOnce I got my sandwich, I was even more excited to try any and all of their hot sauces that they have available. My boyfriend and I tried about 10 different options, some spicy and some sweet. Definitely have to say that the Georgia Peach/Vidalia Onion sauce is amazing and so was the Devil's sauce... I don't remember the exact name but it was \"Devil's ____\" and it had habanero in it. \nSuch flavor. Much spice. Wow.\nI almost forgot to mention!!!\nThey had a lemon cookie, I think with white chocolate chips in it. So worth it for people that love lemon.\nOverall, the cherry, vanilla Dr. Pepper, lemon cookie, and just awesome sandwich made the trip pretty awesome!
2 ||| I'm not really sure how to feel about The Grill. I do like that it's a local KW brand with two locations in the area, but aside from that, it's not really anything special. Once in a while, I come here to grab something quick, but it's certainly not one of my regular stops in the plaza.\n\nThey used to have a few veggie burger options: soy turkey, soy chicken and a normal veggie burger, but it looks like they've taken all but the standard veggie burger off the menu. I was a little disappointed. The veggie burger is tasty though, especially when paired with \"Grill sauce.\" The fries are decent, but the onion rings are too battery for me. The rings make me feel like I'm eating fish & chip batter straight up. Maybe some tartar sauce would go well with them. ha.
1 ||| Food is delicious. However the service is terrible. We had a reservation. When we arrived, tables were available but we weren't seated for 10 minutes. It was another 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. Water was not provided until our food came. We never received a bread basket. Same story when waiting for the bill. We were completely ignored. It would have been better just to have ordered from the to-go window.
4 ||| Wow!!! What a great find.  The stuffed peppers I had were awesome and NOT breaded.  They really take their tequila seriously. The Naranja Margarita was so good we asked for the recipe.  The bartender came out and told us everything from how they infuse their tequila to how they make their Margarita mix.  Our server was very knowledgable about all aspects of the menu.  Will be back very soon!!!!
1 ||| Food wasn't bad... I've been in there three times now.  Love having a good breakfast place on Mill.  So why only 2 stars?  SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.  The last two times I went, it was incredible how long everything took.  And while it wasn't insanely busy, the staff were literally running around... sometimes carrying full plates!?  Waited about 20 minutes after sitting down to get that \"Has anybody helped you yet?\", and then it took well over an hour to get any food.  If they would just tell you at the front counter that the wait was over an hour, I'd be fine with that.  Pretty much exact same experience 2 times in a row, but like I said I'm a sucker for a breakfast joint.  Maybe 3rd time is the charm?
4 ||| I am surprised no one has written a review here yet! Kileys Grill was a huge disappointment to say the Least.  After the name and owners changed my boyfriend and I were nervous to return because the food at Kileys was absolutely horrible and took a million years to even get our food on fight nights.  Anyways I had ordered a Calzone with pineapples. Yes, Just pineapples, Don't judge me!  Let me tell you, It was AMAZING.  And when I had checked into Yelp off my phone i received 10% off of our bill.  But the waitress said it might not be able to work and asked her manager/owner.    The owners wife and manager came over and was beyond nice, I absolutely love when business owners are extremely friendly and not scary (like the owner of my job). She gave us the 10% off which i appreciate immensely.  \nMy boyfriend had ordered the bacon burger and was in love with it and ate it all! He was not a fan of the onion rings b/c they seemed just a little soggy for our taste.  Then our friend had ordered the jack daniels wings which were even more amazing! I wish i would have gotten that as well! But next time I go we willl have to definitely order those for sure! Cannot wait to go back and try more stuff.  \n\nNo desserts  on the menu, If the owner reads this, I make desserts, muffins, pies, cakes, cupcakes, cake pops as my side job and anyone wanting to sell my stuff Id be more than happy to  help ;)
0 ||| Dear Shitty Floor Manager at Fry's,\n\nI know that your store's prices are cheaper than almost any place locally. There's a reason I'm buying my MacBook there. However, this does not give you carte blanche to act like a total dick when I don't buy your warranty, nor does it mean you should make me wait 15 minutes just for you to go grab a laptop (one which you yourself admitted you were overstocked on).\n\nWhen someone approaches you in the middle of our conversation to tell you that the keyboard you directed them toward was located in a completely different section of the store than where you sent them, this means you should apologize. It does not mean you should roll your eyes at them.\n\nAnd when I say thanks and begin to walk away, you probably should keep in mind that I can hear you when you tell me \"good luck\" in reference to my not buying your stupid warranty. The reason I don't want your warranty is because it means I would have to come back and talk to you. I've never broken a laptop in my life, and I'm not going to break this one either. So do your job and shut your mouth.\n\nLove,\n-Kevin\n\nPS: Young polite girl at register, you're A-OK.
3 ||| After the demise of the Argentinian sandwich shop here, I wondered what business would take the place in this location.  I was naturally intrigued when I found out that there would be a smoothie and acai bowl place opening up in its stead. I think this is a great location for acai bowls, since Sprouts is just a few steps away, bringing in the more health-conscious crowd.  I went in with high hopes of getting a healthy, fruitful bowl.\n\nThere are quite a few bowls to choose from, some of them fruity, others more dessert-like, with peanut butter and chocolate.  I opted for a fruitier bowl, getting the tropical.  This was my first time trying an acai bowl, and it was quite tasty.  The bottom layer was a smooth, thick acai puree/sorbet-like mixture, which tasted berry-like.  There was crunchy, sweet granola layered in between the acai and the tropical fruit (Banana, mango, and pineapple), with large, thin shaved pieces of coconut completing the bowl. The granola itself was a high quality mixture, containing ingredients such as flax seed. The bowl was a nice mixture of textures and of tastes.  I ordered a small (About $5), and it definitely filled me up!\n\nService was very friendly, and they offer a points reward system which uses your e-mail to keep track of your purchases.  The interior is pretty bare-bones, and it seems like they kept much of the same color scheme as the previous owner.\n\nDefinitely a good place to go if you're looking for a healthier alternative to dessert, or if you want a lighter (Yet filling) meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!
2 ||| Overpriced good food!!  The price of the food did not quite justify the overall quality and certainly not the quantity.  The staff was A+ and excellent service.  Also, they were very knowledgable about the overall menu items and set our expectations very well.  If you want to impress someone, well, maybe a good place.  However, if you are looking for value, I suggest other premium steakhouses.  Call me unreasonable, but I would prefer Ruth's Chris over this restaurant.
3 ||| I have visited Indian Paradise on several more occasions since my first visit. The food remains very good as well as the service. Prices have gone up a bit but is still good value for the money. Try the lunch time buffet - great variety and the food is fresh and well priced.
3 ||| The Running of the Bulls in Cave Creek is always a good time!
3 ||| Great and friendly atmosphere. Seasonal and regional menu; very accommodating.\nOpen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I got to meet the 2 owners; brothers, who are very friendly. Menu changes 8 times a year. With time, this will easily be 5 stars.
1 ||| it is very nice to have a healthier alternative during lunch. That being said, the food really isn't that great and is WAY OVERPRICED. My small pita sandwich (comes with a side), and drink was over $10 bucks. You can go to Paradise or Subway for a whole lot less. Not only that, but there is never any parking available, and most of the menu items are completely bland. Drop the prices and add some flavor to the food.
0 ||| This review is for the poor service. It was so bad, we walked out before our main food ever came. It took 25 minutes to order food and after 1 1/2 hours, we asked if our food is on the way. The waiter made excuses saying he doesn't usually work with these cooks today and that they have their own thing going on back there...blah blah blah...basically, he didn't want us to blame him for the bad service. But, they're a team and he should've be on top of it. We walked out after sitting there for two hours and empty drinks that haven't been checked on for 30 minutes. This place needs to be on the RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE SHOW. We will never eat here again and strongly suggest anyone shouldn't either. There are way better Mexican restaurants in town that have authentic food with better prices. If you're looking for authenticity and good service, you should go elsewhere. This place is reeks americanized Mexican food and clueless waiters. Don't disappoint yourself by going here.
0 ||| I went here ONE time and that will definitely be the last.  \n\n- Crowd- Bikers (40-60+) \n- Wet- Tshirt Contest of 40+ women, in kiddie tub, with old man pouring buckets of water on them \n- Hot and sticky \n- Over crowded (sweaty/smelly)\n\nWould not go back here again, not my scene at all, but for some it may make for perfect fit; so I am not hatin', just not for me!
3 ||| First off if you are a female who runs under 8:20ish pace please avoid this review...for you nice walk runners and males of all kinds feel free to proceed. \n\nFirst off I will admit my review may not be as objective as it should be:\nI didn't bring home hardware\nI didn't PR\nI did get the worst in race injury of my life and looked ridiculous in MGD64 gear.\n\nLike: flat, music, and non-repetitive\nDislike: high cost, lots of competition (I want to feel like hot stuff and be in front!), not much free stuff at the end, INSANE traffic, and forced to go to the race expo, all non-studying/running time must be spent Yelping!\n\n\nI am tentatively suggesting the IMS Marathon instead although this will be my first time competiting this February! (and i looks like I might get first overall female so fast ladies avoid it!)
0 ||| I have been to Vegas many times and this was by far one of the worst hotels you can stay at in Vegas! The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because the bed and pillows were nice. That's about it. I have a very long list of what went wrong for my fun 30th Birthday weekend.\n\nFirst, most of the outlets in the room didn't work. There was no lights in the bathroom and the phone didn't work. Also, we had no toilet paper in the room and when we called to have them come fix everything and bring toilet paper. No one ever showed up. I had to go to the front desk and ask them to send us toilet paper. \n\nWhen it came time to dine at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast, it took about an hour and a half for our food to come. The customer service in this hotel was so bad. I couldn't believe it.\n\nWhen it came time to go to the pool. The first made us get in line with everyone else. Then they told us guest had to use another door. We walked all the way across the casino to be told we had to go back and get wrist bands. Then we did and they wouldn't let us in that door with our bags of sunscreen. We asked the front desk what door hotel guest had to go to and they sent us to do door that was not letting anyone in the pool. Finally we find the right door after about 1 hour of trying to figure it out and by the time we go to the pool there was NO place to sit. They told us we could get a cabana for an additional $500. I asked for the manager and when the pool manager came over, I told him I wanted to speak with the hotel manager and he told me he couldn't call her. I had to get up, walk all the way across the casino again and wait about 30min to speak with her. She did give us $200 towards our cabana, but we still paid $300. I couldn't believe it. Although, Dino at the pool is AMAZING and he was the only one that felt bad about what was going on and took some stress off of us.\n\nAll in all, it was very stressful and everyone in my party was getting upset. We spent a good $10,000 on everything there and should never have been treated the way we were treated. \n\nI will never stay or even go to this place again, no will I ever use any Hard Rock for work or personal use again. There are much better Hotels in Vegas!
0 ||| As someone else noted, if I could give this place a zero star rating I would!  Also somehow we should warn folks that this pace is now calling itself Star Noodles and to beware.\n\nWe've been here  in its previous incarnation and we had mixed reviews. We come for F1 and stay a week to experience all Montreal has to offer. The first year we tried this place we found it quaint yet I felt that something was not quite right with my chicken wing appetizer. ...  As if it wasn't quit good but not enough for sure to say it was bad. \n\nThe next year I swore to try it again and everything was ok and in fact pretty good. Now I'd like to state at this time (2011) it was very late and so super busy that we barely got in. We actually waited a reasonable time to get our meals and by that I mean 5mins or so.  \n\nThis year we are late going in that it's the last day of he weekend festivities and we are super early for Montrealer's eating time (7ish).  Now the bad part....I will NEVER come back here again. My husband ordered the pork spring rolls as an appetizer and that dish is the best we have to write about but even that was delivered in less than 30 sec. Yup I'm not kidding.   Then a true test for me of any place ....the hot & sour soup.  Gross. I mean bad but I kept at it hoping I am wrong; you know when you keep thinking \"we'll maybe another spoonful\". I left it half empty and they didn't ask why.  The main dishes. My husbands Orange Beef came again in seriously 30 sec to 1 min absolutely tops. It is so heavily coated like a bad chicken ball from some dive and I wonder how did they do that in less than a min from appetizer end?????  You can figure that out.  Then the worse part - my main dish #79 garlic spicy beef and I'm looking forward to all that it says.  Oh my Lord gross gross.  It was so heavenly laden with salt and/orMSG that i could not eat it and I did try.  No one came to ask how any thing was and this even tho the place was not even half full. When they came to get the plates it was obvious that my plate was barely touched but still no questions. So I say \"that was terrible and so full of salt it was unbearable\". He smiled, left, and brought us the bill for the full amount. \n\nI left $1 tip.  Not sure they got the message or if they whether they care; somehow I doubt it
1 ||| Went on a Thursday night.  It was alright.  Not crowded at all so we didn't stay long.  Came back later in the night and it was even more dead.\n\nLots of techno and dance.  But we did ask the DJ to play some Hip Hop and he squeezed two songs in.
1 ||| Like several others on this site, it is possible that our experience here could be chalked up to a \"bad night\", but this is my third time to Mesa (2 others for lunch) and I have yet to have a memorable meal here. Our night started with a 30 minute wait for our table (yes we had a reservation) and were given all sorts of attitude from the hosts. We ordered cocktails after being seated, signature Margarita's for a few  and everyone who did, myself included stated how \"sweet\" they were. Missing that sour balance and very disappointing. Appetizers we fine, nothing special. When the main courses were delivered, two (of 6) went back for being under cooked. I really can;t express how disappointed we were. With all the great places popping up in Vegas, it seems that Mesa is riding on it's past reputation and not what got it to the dance.
3 ||| Yummy, delicious, fresh food.  Definitely worth the price.
0 ||| Horrible horrible horrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend their services to my worst enemy. They are incompetent and lack knowledge.\n\nI had an alignment done on the car after a major suspension overhaul and they tried to tell me my parts were worn out and couldn't get it into specs. The alignment they performed was tolerable for a few months and then I noticed my inner tires were wearing unevenly. Brought it back in since the alignment had a year warranty. I drop the car off and get a call 15 minutes later blaming me for replacing more suspension parts and my warranty was voided now. I went back into the store and politely told them I hadn't replaced anything after the initial alignment was performed. The tech continued to blame me and even called me a liar once. After a bit more uncomfortable arguing they agreed to finish the alignment. Once it was completed I had the guy at the register to never bring my car back to there store. I brushed that comment off and drove the car home with a new violent pull to the right. The tech mustve intentionally ruined they alignment due to little bitch syndrome. Had to bring my car to a friend and had the alignment fixed and within almost perfect specs. They had no reason to treat me like a criminal when I was clearly a paying customer! Screw these losers, I hope they lose their business and someone better moves in like discount tire.\n\nEveryone that lives in Mtns Edge should steer clear of this crap tire shop. If you value your car, don't bring it here.
3 ||| One of these days I will learn to listen to my server.  Case in point, today I wanted to try the mac and cheese with a burger and my server suggested I try one of the versions other than plain.  Of course I didn't listen and while it was certainly OK there was not a bold cheesy taste.  After thinking about it I realized it wasn't designed to be bold by itself so that it could be a base for other things to be added, DUH!\n\nSeeing as I have 9 check ins in 4 months it is obvious they are a regular in my lunch rotation.  It is a friendly place to go and most of the employees know me.  Quite often James, the GM, will wander around the customers and chat.  Once he even filled in as a server when one was sick, I think he needs to stick to his day job. :-)\n\nIf you see something on the chalkboard that looks interesting better get it then as it may disappear in a week or still be there in a month.  I have missed the opportunity to try a couple of items because I already \"knew\" what I wanted to have and should have been more flexible.  There is a patio in the back which is heated in the winter.  I have found it is easiest to park in the back and use the back door.
0 ||| I was so amped up for this event and when I arrived, I was immediately unplugged. This was my first encounter with Glendale's Chocolate Affair and my expectations were set WAAAAY too high.  Where are the elaborate chocolate displays and demonstrations? Where are the artisians? The enthusiasts? The chocoholics?  All I saw were ridiculous lines of people waiting to pay too much for your basic fair food in which some of it was dipped in chocolate. BFD.  Maybe it was the best chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick ever, but I will never know because I'm not waiting any longer than 15 minutes to find out. \n\nNext time, I'm just going to head down the Central Phoenix Farmer's Market where I can give my money to local folks who are passionate about their craft and are fantastic at what they do. (Bite Me Brownies, \nWei of Chocolate, etc.) I won't have to wait in line longer than It's a Small World at Disney for some crappy apple dipped in chocolate. \n\nThankfully, we didn't bring the dogs as they would've been trampled and I feel sorry for the people who had their little ones in strollers because they were like salmons swimming upstream.  I overheard one dad say that he had had enough.  He was taking the stroller back to the car and just carry the baby. \n\nOn a positive note, the entertainers were good for the time I was there and I found the little area shops charming.
0 ||| Great ambience but the food doesn't cut it.  The only thing that was pod was the free dinner rolls that were buttery and had sea salt on top to offset the sweetness.  \n\nGot the $55 ribeye that came luke warm and under seasoned.  By far the worst ribeye I've ever had at a nice steakhouse.  It was full of fat too.\n\nThe risotto was horrible.  Sour like something we bad and it came with huge cherry tomatoes, very unrefined.\n\nShort rib was delicious, highly recommended.  Scallops were just whatever and the carpaccio was good, savory and worth trying.\n\nService was excellent minus out main server.  He didn't do much but the other help was amazing.\n\nMonkey bread was recommended so we tried it.  Very very very sweet, too sweet.  I y thing that was good was the banana ice cream but I wouldn't get this of you for like your deserts too sweet.\n\nOverall, it was a bad steakhouse.  Skip it
0 ||| Agree with the review that says it is for the 20-30 singles and that it needs a facelift, not a place to plan your family vacation!!  Stay away from the room service unless you are in the aforementioned demographic & are too drunk to care what you eat & how much you pay for it. My kids were too scared to go to this pool! Find a more family friendly hotel like MGM Grand where there are great shows and a lion exhibit & rainforest cafe'. I hear there is an M&Ms store somehwere?? New York New York has a great arcade & is by the MGM Grand, too.  Also, there is a fun tram that stops at the MGM Grand, but it doesn't link to the Luxor, another downer!! I'm sure there are better family experiences in Vegas than the Luxor! We were ill-informed.
0 ||| My friend and I were looking forward to having lunch here on our lunch break last Friday. I drove by the new restaurant and thought it was a good idea to try it out, especially since we love Italian food. So we got there about 12:30 p.m. and there were about 4-5 tables of two customers each. We waited at the hostess stand, the waitress looked at us, but never acknowledged that she would be right with us or smiled or anything. So we waited for about 5 minutes. At this time, the other customers that were seated started looking at us. So needless to say, we decided to have lunch elsewhere. We would have liked to try the place out, but never had the chance to. I'm not sure if they are short staffed or something, but we would have waited had someone said they'd be right with us at some point....
0 ||| The only reason I go to Walmart if either because I was some crap that's dirt cheap or I need a fishing license. Well, it's that time of the year again to get that license! Dropped by later at night when my other errands were over, spent about 5 minutes with the licensing guy, but he said I had to pay up front since he closed his register (10:30PM). He told me I had to go to register 15, too. Now this license for all water ways with trout stamp and two pole stamp was about $60.00, and it was in my hand. A less honest man would've just left but not me. \n\nI wish I had. There were three people in front of me in lane 15 (NO ONE in other lanes), and it took 30 minutes. It was because 1. I was in the only cigarette line! 2. The cashier was very slow. 3. The drawer was not well stocked and she called for change every two minutes.\n\nI got home at 11:15PM, and I am glad my fishing license is good until 2010!!!
2 ||| I came here with some friends yesterday and we shared a number of items. As I walked in, I noticed how lovely it smelled and was excited to try their waffles.\n \nWe sat and perused the menu for a while and I was a little disappointed that no one really checked on us or even asked if we wanted waters or more menus than just the one for our group of three. We finally figured out what we wanted and went up to the counter to order.\n\nThe lady behind he counter kept interrupting my dining companion as he started to order by yelling behind to another person who worked there. I thought that was a little rude, so that definitely put me off.\n\nOur food took a while to come, but it looked really pretty. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n-red velvet wafflenut \n-Nutella and almond wafflenut \n-The Fat Elvis waffle\n-Strawberry and chocolate waffle\n-Vegas churro waffle with honey, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla ice cream\n\nEverything was solid. The consensus was that the churro waffle was the favorite and I personally enjoyed the strawberry waffle, minus the chocolate sauce. \n\nService needs work and the location is awkward, so I don't see myself making much effort to come back to this place in the future.
1 ||| We came here with a spontaneous groupon with a medium hunger and an open mind. I got the angus sliders and the tortilla soup. The sliders were pretty okay, I'd maybe order those again, it was 3/$10 or $11. I drank water and the water tasted fine, not bleachy or dirty. Our drinks were well attended to and the service was pretty quick, but then again, we were there at noon on a Monday and there were maybe 10 other tables to attend to. \n\nI liked the atmosphere. Dark wood, dark walls, white marblesque tables. The adjacent candy store was neat but skippable. \n\nBF got a Cuban that came on a french roll, I think and was loaded with peppers. I wasn't a fan but he liked it. \n\nPeople seemed to complain a lot about the service; that wasn't the issue here. This was a very basic, TGIF/Applebee's kind of dining experience. Everything tasted processed and prepackaged. For reference, the tortilla soup was a smooth bisque with cubes of colorless \"chicken\" and lacked seasoning. It was salty, yes but nothing interesting or complex about the flavor. \n\nThe burgers came without ketchup or mustard. \n\nIt was forgettable. Esp for how much it would have cost without the Groupon. After tax and tip, we didn't really save any money on our $20 for $40. We ended up at about $35. But it wasn't as bad most of the reviews were leading me to believe!
1 ||| Hottest club in vegas! Probably too hot. Literally. The hip hop room was so packed and sweaty you can't move.
1 ||| I went there twice.......the first time shortly after they opened. The restaurant was half full and the food came out quickly and was tasty. I had the Zigeunerschnitzel with Spaetzle and it reminded me of back home.\n\nThe second time was three days ago and it seemed like they did not have a real chef because the food came out one at a time with very long time in between food coming from the kitchen almost as if each was cooked individually. This time the Spaetzle were a starchy, watery mess (way overcooked) not sure how somebody can screw this up. Interestingly enough the Cordon Bleu (pork) was burned around the corners and I had to work my way half way through the thing to get a bite of ham and cheese. definitely no comparison to my first visit here. I ended up being there for almost an hour.....\n\nPro\nCheaper than others in town\nFriendly waitress\n\nCons\nFood inconsistent\nVery Slow \nyou feel like eating in the middle of a warehouse (no decor)\n\nAfter my second experience I will definitely not go back soon. The waitress actually told the owner that I was not too happy. You'd think she would come forward from behind the counter.....well think again, obviously there is no interest in what people think.
1 ||| This place in general is a little too cheesy for me.  They offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff.  The waitstaff remind me of the movie Office Space where they try to be overly excited that you are there.  It is almost like you are buying a used car.   \n\nI will start with the food.  It is very messy and drizzled in butter.  Don't wear any good clothes or risk having butter splotches all over.  The food itself is just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  \n\nThe on-tap beer selection is less than desired.  If you like mass produced beers then you are in luck.  \n\nI would say save your money go to a locally owned restaurant where you won't be subjected to all of the cheesiness.
1 ||| Review is only for the tacos they serve outside. They're $.99 each but they charge tax with it. I like their selection of meats like cow head and beef tongue and they've got like 5 salsas. But I found their meat to be really tough and lacking flavor. Definitely a taco stand you can skip.
0 ||| I Specifically asked for NO MEAT of any kind.  Even made inquires about the sauces and if they had chicken broth, etc.  When I got home we found our rice had little bits of beef in it.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner.  Also the prices online were cheaper than what they charged in the store, not cool.  Certainly will not return to Quick Wok.
4 ||| Simply the BEST! I've been coming here for years now after researching their good reviews & they have NEVER let me down. Don & Janet take good care of my car that's getting old & falling apart. Thank you Brake Masters for being the most honest mechanics in Vegas! In the past 2 years I have taken my car to them for Brakes & they have told me I don't need brakes yet instead of ramming me & saying I do. When I got my front finally done they sd u have awhile before u need back brakes. Today we dropped my car off for a check engine light & they cld & said a minor issue, gave me estimate n had my car ready within the hour. A minor repair at minor cost because they're HONEST!
1 ||| Stopped in for breakfast about 9:00 AM on a Monday.  It was not crowded.  The service was quick, but not really friendly. The food was typical IHOP - tasty.  The noise level in this place was awful.  The music (50's music) was so loud I couldn't talk to anyone or hear the servers.  Made me want to eat and get out as quickly as possible, which I did.
2 ||| This place used to be better and more knowledgeable and helpful.  I guess I hit bad staff day or something.\ngood prices and a great selection.   \nNeed chairs to sit and read.
0 ||| Stay away!\n\nI have never had a worse breakfast experience. I used to live in the apartments right across the street, so I thought it would be a convenient place for a weekend brunch. Boyfriend and I headed over there one Saturday morning to check it out. I ordered a veggie skillet, and he ordered a make-your-own omelet. The menu description for my skillet said \"fresh cut veggies.\" It came out with cauliflower and crinkled carrots. When I raised that point to our waitress, she giggled and said \"freshly frozen!\" Boyfriend's omelet also came out with only half the ingredients he ordered, and one that he didn't. The only good thing about this place is that they adjusted the check appropriately for our meals.
1 ||| This is the only place to get Schlotzsky's so regardless of the lackluster dining experience  - I will be back.\n\nI love the original.  The warm sourdough type bread with the warm ham... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good. \n\nThis place is old and run down.  The service sucks.  But if you want some Schlotzcky's this is it!
1 ||| Whoa, totally don't understand the love for this place.  We met with a group over here and boy was I disappointed.  To begin, why doesn't Glendale have meters?  Why do I have to go out and move my car every two hours?  That makes it really hard to drink and sober up without drinking and driving if I have to go out and move my car to a new spot every 120 minutes.  That's not Haus Murphy's fault but it is something that will deter me from going out there to drink.  \n\nSo we get in there and our waitress is awesome enough.  She is friendly, responsive, and helpful.  In fact, I want that waitress to come with me to some other restaurants (looking at you Fez) and show them how it should be done.  In any event, she was great and the only saving grace of this establishment.\n\nNow on to the bad food.  I'm not German, never been to Germany, and my German culinary knowledge is limited to Milwaukee Brewers' baseball games.  That being said, food either tastes good or it doesn't.  I had the Wullwurst sausages.  They came out looking like fried Twinkies and tasted about the same.  No spice, no real flavor, and surrounded by a tough skin.  They were flanked by some purple cabbage that was unedible and some German potato salad that was some of the nastiest mush I've ever had.  \n\nApparently unsatisfied by this gluttonous torture that I had already endured, I ordered the German chocolate cake.  Now, I know this isn't an actual German food but it looked good and I thought they might go all out with it.  Nope, again - not good.  Flavorless.  I was basic chocolate cake with a thin layer of coconut on top and some Betty Crocker frosting on the outside.  \n\nSorry but this place was just not good and I will not be back.
3 ||| This place is nice. Its not too expensive and they carry lots of variety.  I used the 15% off yelp offer and paid $8for 2 smoothies. I ordered the berry oat and hated the splenda taste. They promptly and happily made me a different one and I loved it. I only order that one now. Its the health nut-but I sub out the protein for yougart.
0 ||| The experience we had with Brothers Plumbing and Air Conditioning was horrible. Our a/c went out and we called to have a technician come out and figure out what the problem was. They sent someone, he fixed \"something\", they charged us $468.73 and they left...our a/c went out with the same exact problem exactly 1 week later. They came back out, looked at our unit, turned it on (since we had it off for hours to cool it down and keep it from causing other issues) and said, \"Ok, seems good.\" and left again. Twenty minutes later....guess what??? Same problem, we called someone else to come out and fix the problem and they said not only should the first service cost no more than $230 but they also did not fix the problem. Now, they won't refund any money even though they did not fix the problem and over charged us!
3 ||| We've been twice in the past couple years and enjoyed both performances (Simon Boccanegra and Madame Butterfly) immensely. Unfortunately, by the time we fly in and find a hotel (even at Jerry's) we only feel like we can afford the cheap seats. The chairs are a little narrow up there in opera glass country. Might have to open the wallet a little next time. Check if there is a pre-show lecture - worth the time and you might get closer parking in the garage. Parking is a good deal for AZ.
4 ||| On February 27th, I let my younger sister Ariel drive my girl (truck) to school. Sadly for me and my girl it was raining outside. Due to the lack of her driving experience, she caused a major accident on Oakey & Rainbow. \n\nIt caused major damages to my girl. Luckily for us, one of the other drivers involved in the accident recommended me to Metropolitan Auto Body. I called and they arranged a tow truck and rental car to come & get me out of there. Upon arrival, the rental car was there and I got to meet the manager who gave an estimate quote. After 4 days of them working on the front of my girl, I got my girl back looking like new. They also helped me adding two more fog lights. \n\nI would like to thank everyone at Metropolitan Auto Body for helping us through this stressful time... THANK YOU!
0 ||| I've been to Axis-Radius about 5 times and have never had a spectacular time. I will list the reasons why.\n\n(1) If you go on the weekend then the place is nasty packed. I am pretty sure that every time a big DJ comes to town they violate fire code by packing as many people as possible in. On one instance, I had bought pre-sale tickets. Upon getting there I waited in line for nearly 2 hours and the line moved about 10 people (who were also presale). All the while, people rolling in and paying door-price-premiums got in. Fuck you Axis-Radius for not letting PAID customers in while you let people willing to pay premium prices to get them and their posse in. \n\n(2) Prices. Drink prices are the highest I've seen. I think a long island (my staple drink) is about $12. Talk about getting raped - this is Scottsdale, not a holiday weekend in Vegas. I will say that I came here one time and they gave my group (5+ people) a FREE bottle of vodka, with bottle service. I guess Thursdays are super slow days for them.\n\n(3) Creeper hell. I am a guy and *I* am weirded out my the creeper groups that seem to plague Axis-Radius. Can't people, especially girls, dance without you and your 4 buddies doing a Night at the Roxbury skit where you surround a girl and don't let her go. It's bad enough where I will step in and act like their boyfriend until the weirdos leave. How creepy.\n\n(4) Trip hazard. I don't know what it is, but I've found more things to trip over in Axis-Radius, sober and drunk. I guess that is extra entertainment.\n\nBottom line - stay way unless you want to pay a premium to be mobbed... or are just dying to see a special DJ. As for me, I'm done with A-R.
2 ||| It was OK.  \n\nUpon a raving review from my boss' girlfriend, I took my girlfriend there for a late valentine's day dinner.  I booked reservations for 9PM on a Saturday.  We kinda needed them, but there was an open table anyway, so I guess you have a 50/50 shot.  \n\nYou can't order liquor.   My GF and I typically have a martini prior to dinner.  No dice here.  Only wine, and maybe beer.  \n\nAppetizer - I read on yelp about the pomme frites, but we chose the Lulu plate instead (cheese, fruit and meat).  (I wanted the frites, the GF didn't.  I lost.)  The cheese was really good.  The meats were a bit weird.  One of them was proscuitto, but I am not sure which (btw, I know proscuitto - I still couldn't tell).  They had stuffed cherry peppers - those were soooo awesome.  But, the GF didnt love that one. \n\nI ordered the steak frites because I really wanted the pomme frites.  The meat was tough and not really tasteful.  Fries - overcooked and really just not that good.  The sauce was good, but cold.  Overall, my meal was not really that good.  My girlfriend got the special, which was veal hangar steak, shrimp riscotto and sauteed asparagus.  The veal was good, but the sauce just sucked in my opinion.  It had a liquorice flavor, and I don't dig on that.  The asparagus was the best part of the meal.  \n\nWe also got a bottle of french wine.  It was a merlot cab franc blend.  Like the meal, lackluster and I wish I ordered something cheaper, even though it was $36.  \n\nOverall - the meal was OK, but I don't think I will go back.
3 ||| I've attended the AZ Renaissance Festival for over 15 years now and love it!\n\nFrom the moment that you approach the front gates and are greeted/heckled by the crowd of townspeople, you're transported back to a fantasy version of the middle ages. Whether you choose to dress up in period-appropriate attire or show up in your 21st century duds, you'll feel right at home amidst the quaint shops, cottages, and stands that make up the milieu of the Arizona Renaissance Festival. \n\nWhen we start early (a good idea if you'd like to avoid the hottest part of the day and the longest lines/biggest crowds) my favoritest way to begin the day is with pastries or the freshly made crepes. There are several very munchable snacks that are perfect for enjoying as you stroll: cinnamon roasted almonds, freshly made pretzels (sold from a large rack carried over a gentleman's shoulder as he wanders the crowd), heck, even the famous (and delicious!) Turkey Leg is very portable. The Turkey Leg, complete with crispy skin, is delicious but the portion is HUGE, I can rarely come even close to finishing. Additional substantial meal-fare items are the bread bowls (my husband's favorite) and Steak on a Stake - all yummy! \n\nIf you've ever wanted to try your hand at throwing knives, axes, or tomatoes, this is the place for you! There are lots of different games (which have an additional cost) and rides to pass the time and keep the kiddos busy - a huge swan-swing, pirate ships, spinning butterfly swings are all fanciful options to choose from.\n\nWe always try to make the most out of the free entertainment offered and start our day by plotting out the shows that we'd like to see - our favorites are Barely Balanced (acrobats that are talented and are also hilarious), Thom Sellectomy the Sword Swallower (gross but impressive), Falconry, where they show off lots of beautiful rescued birds over an open green belt (it is educational and interesting!) and of course Jousting. The Jousting is a little cheesy, but we typically try to catch the last show: The Joust to the Death, which is the best one.\n\nIt is easy to fill the gaps between the shows, games, and meals by wandering through the shops and browsing their wares; they have lots of unique items from renaissanc-y clothing to weapons and jewelry to wooden toys to furniture. \n\nThe petting zoo - complete with ducks, bunnies, sheep dogs, pigs, goats, and a highland cow(!) - as well as the Greyhound Rescue pavilion with their sweet pups are always obligatory stops to get in our warm fuzzies :)\n\nTips: Be sure to bring cash, as many of the food vendors don't accept credit cards. Also, if you plan on attending the shows, set aside cash to give after the performance - they are free, but the performers live off of the tips and they do a great job, so it is good to have cash handy if you feel so inclined. There are ATMs in the faire, but the fees that they charge get expensive.\n\nTraffic on the 60 headed out to the festival gets really, really bad. Mid-day on a busy weekend can turn what might normally be a 40 minute drive into 1.5-2 hours, so be prepared. \n\nParking is well done - they've taken a page from the Disney parks and have a bunch of people there to direct all of the cars into specific spaces in a very quick and efficient manner. \n\nThe parking lot and grounds are all in a dusty dirt field, so plan accordingly with what you wear. If it is rainy, that all turns to mud and it is a MESS! \n\nBathrooms throughout the whole festival are clean and modern... there is a restroom outside the entry that typically has long lines, but the lines for the restrooms inside tend to be much shorter. \n\nIf you're looking for something unique and fun that will transport you to another time and place, definitely make the trek to the Arizona Renaissance Festival; its a blast!
0 ||| This place it is not a buffet and will not honor the 15% stays the contract has expired,therefore will not do it. Overprice and unfriendly customer service.
3 ||| Since this movie theater has been overtaken by Cineplex, there have been little changes. First off, I am glad that Cineplex offered free movie tickets in exchange of my no longer valid AMC points card and very happy that this movie theater now offers more affordable rates compared to AMC. Cheapy Tuesdays are in effect!\n\nThis theater is still the largest in the downtown core with 23 screens and features a great selection of american blockbusters to international films and independent productions. It's very roomy and comfy. Even their washrooms are better than other places because they offer paper toilet seat covers, just like in the airplane!\n\nOne thing I noticed over the past year is that they seem to be cracking down on people sneaking in to watch perhaps 2 movies in a row or going into another room. There's very little surveillance in this theater, the only person checking your ticket is right at the entrance and once you're in, you have free range. \nThis is no longer possible because they do not feature the name of the movie on the top of the room. You will only know what room your movie is playing in by seeing it on your ticket.\nScotiabank theatre does not hide which movies are playing.
1 ||| This place SUCKED...the service was terrible, only went because my niece raved about the place. We got there and waited almost 20 mins. before we saw our waitress, the food was pricey for what seemed to be everyday Mexican food. But the service was just terrible...I was not impressed at all.
4 ||| This time I enjoyed my experience even more than last!  Skinny skin-on fries were very tasty.  My Vienna Premium Beef Chicago Dog on a soft and steamed Vienna Poppy Seed Bun was authentic and delicious.  And, my 3\" Italian Beef Sandwich with sweet peppers on a Gonnella Italian Style Roll that had been drenched in Au Jus was simply great with and without Giardiniera.  Again I got the most bang for my buck by ordering the #4 Windy City's Best of Both Worlds.  Especially for dinner, it would be a shame to only consume one sandwich or dog here, in any event!  \n\nThe proprietors, who are hands-on owners, were very friendly, and service was first-rate.  Ambiance is Windy City Chicago sports all the way, with great-tasting Chi-Town comfort food.
2 ||| Am usually not a coffee person... but yest we had some time to while awa and tot vll check out this coffee shop...though the name doesn appeal at all, i must say for a change i enjoyed drinking coffee..ordered a cappuccino without any added flavor...it smelled good..and tasted nice!!\nalso picked up their house made muffins...a craneberry orange muffin..it was delicious...actually pieces of fruit to bite on...i loved it. the ambience is also nice for some one to just sit and read or listen to some music while enjoying a good cup of coffee.
0 ||| RUN AWAY fast!!!! The worst store I have ever been in- these Maricons are so rude- decided to close the store down when it was 3 in the afternoon while I was inside. They basically told me to get out, I guess they had a lovers spat or something.... Anyway I'm sure that \"nature\" will take it course and they will close for good. I seriously think they have a need for some years of therapy with the way they treat people.
4 ||| I have been going to Verrado Grille for over a year now. They recently got a new chef about 2 months ago, he is the real deal! I have a gluten allergy and can't eat out often from cross-contamination in the kitchen so i usually order salads to be safe. Well, the special for that night was a sun-dried tomato roasted chicken with 2 sides. Because i couldn't eat the pre-made herbs, the chef made a new batch of gluten free herbs for my chicken, really nice of them. It  was the best tasting chicken i have had in a long time (and i eat chicken a lot.) Not to mention I didn't get sick from anything! Which really goes to show they actually know what food allergies are. I highly recommend this place for anyone with an allergy like me or just \"picky eaters\" ;] Plus they have some amazing bartenders who can make a good drink!
0 ||| Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. \n\nI do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get.
3 ||| Let's face it, no one enjoys going to the laundromat, but if you have a ginormous comforter that needs laundering, this is a great place to come to get it done.   The place is clean and has plenty of large machines that can accomodate your biggest laundry needs.  The employees are friendly and will help you if you are unsure of where to start. They also have a change machine in-house which makes things easier.  \n\nAlso, if you are the lazy sort and don't want to do your own laundry, they have a drop off service where the employees will wash, dry and fold your clothes for you. Wow, who would have thought that you could still get full-service at the laundromat? \n:-)
4 ||| This service is great! I don't trust anyone with my son but I felt comfortable using this company. Olivia was our nanny for the evening and I think she did a fantastic job and was very attentive. Sarah, the owner is one of the nicest people out there :)
4 ||| Another great addition to downtown!!! I love that they use the same kind of tortillas you would find in Mexico. Interesting history in this church. I love how they kept a lot of the original church in the remodel. At this moment I am eating their salsa which is perfect. Spicy but not like you ate the sun. The tacos are Mexico meets urban. Super creative. I'll be back for sure!
1 ||| I checked in at the Rumor after having to cancel a reservation at another local resort due to no parking and a lot of other problems.\n\nCheck in was ok but a bit confusing and two different rates were quoted before the lesser one was approved.  I was told in a harsh tone that they were giving me a discount off their regular rate.  According to the staff on duty they do not take AARP, AAA or any other discount.\n\nFinding and moving into the room was okay.\n\nThe good points:\n1. I like the rainfall shower and bathroom area.\n2. D\u00e9cor in the bedroom was nice with softer lighting.\n3. The bedroom had a large TV, but the one in the main living room area was extremely small.\n4. Air conditioning and heat were quiet.\n5. The resort fee, daily charge, provides you with free internet and two bottles of water.  The pool was the only other \"resort\" item I observed and it was too cold to swim when visiting the LV area.\n6. The large white leather sofa was a nice touch but other comfortable chairs were missing.\n\nThe bad points:\n1. Upon checking the beds the sheets on one had what appeared to be fecal stains. Upon removing them to take the front desk, the mattress pad had short black, like pubic hairs, on it.  Both items were removed and taken to the front desk.  They had new sheets and mattress pad delivered to the room.  We had to make up the bed. ( They did discount the room an additional $20 dollars)\n2. Only 1/2 roll of toilet paper was in the room.  Had to have more delivered.\n3. The small TV in the living room area was inadequate for the space.\n4. I understand the boutique idea.  However the dark gray walls were depressing and made the room dark even with the drapery open.\n5. Large stains on the carpet in several areas.  You could not tell what the stains might have been.\n6. The curtains had several holes in them that were very easy to see; especially with the light from outside.\n7. Parking was close to the room but very dark at night.\n8. I had to call the front desk to find out were ice machines were located.  The one they directed me too was broken.  I had to search three other buildings to find an ice machine.  The machines are not convenient to most rooms.\n9. Very limited on site food service.\n10. There are few electrical outlets in the room we had and plugs would not stay in the outlets when plugged in.\n11. The air conditioning and heater was located beside one of the beds.  This unit blew air right on the bed all night and it was uncomfortable to sleep in due to the air flow.\n12. I requested a late check out and was told it would be an additional $25 for 1 hour, or $40 for a 3 hour extended checkout. (What a joke it was Sunday morning and I had already been told they had very few reservations for Sunday night.) \n\nI realize that rates vary in Las Vegas but this facility seems to be over priced for the services and staff support that a guest receives.  I would have to think seriously if I wished to return.
3 ||| This has been on my excel document of go to's for a long while now and was finally fulfilled last year. \n\nIt was dinner time and we took an elevator up to the level of the restaurant and once you get out, there is a hostess waiting for you. You see the kitchen immediately and the hostess brings you to your table. We didn't have to wait at all. \n\nJust as I hoped for, we got a table right by the window. Perfect view of the Bellagio and their water show. The only thing that ruined the view was cloudy sky. But I wasn't going to let that ruin my dinner.\n\nThe waiter was on top of everything and our glasses were never empty. I ordered the Baked Alaskan Halibut with vegetables and a side of potato gratin. I ordered the side because I had a feeling the portions would be small, but boy was I wrong. The fish was huge and the sauces so delicious. \n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate souffle, which I must say, is DELICIOUS! I still remember the sweet warm chocolate melting in my mouth. Ah, I'd definitely just return for dessert.\n\nThe only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is for one thing. When I took my first bite into my fish, there was a bone in it. And that's just not right. At least it was the only bone in my fish I found.
2 ||| saw the show tonight and it was ok ..dont expect anything spectacular but it is worth the 10.00 you pay at gold star for it.  all the seats are pretty good but kind of a run down theatre but manageable. Jokes arent all that funny but hey they are trying and the show is a pretty low budget show.. But for the money it will most likely entertain you.
1 ||| Hostess was nice upon entering, but I seemed very pressured when walking out to purchase a membership. It totally ruined my relaxed mood. Massage therapist did do exaclty what I asked and made me fee comfortable. If it wasn't for the hostess, I could rate this place better. Also, I have a corporate discount that they honored, but said they can only continue to honor if I got the membership, which seemed weird. My concierge at work said that is not true. Seems to me to hostess really wanted to sell me that membership. Buzz kill.
1 ||| My fianc\u00e9 and I were walking down the strip with my sister and decided to get a drink. We passed this place and I decided I wanted to try it because of the fire on the tables. Yeah, that was a deciding factor for me lol. My fianc\u00e9 got an adios mother fuc*er and my sister and I got a strawberry daiquiri. My fianc\u00e9s drink was strong and well work the money while my sister and I's drinks were just overpriced slushies. Pretty disappointing since it was my sister's first drink ever and because I can get buzzed off of an 8oz. glass of wine. My fianc\u00e9 even asked the waitress if there was any alcohol or if it was a virgin. According to her, it had 10%, same as a beer. I get buzzed off of a beer so they must have forgotten to put the alcohol in. Pretty disappointing. We won't be returning unfortunately.
0 ||| out of all the metro park stores ive been including the ones in vegas this was probably the worse one ive been too. the workers looked miserable to be there and yeah thats all
0 ||| I had an appointment at 11 am and it is now 12:30pm and I still have not been seen. Why make an appointment if you still have to wait this long? I'm a healthy adult in my 20s and just need a shot, didn't think it would take this long. I wanted to come here because I am Vietnamese and wanted to have a Vietnamese doctor to feel more comfortable. This has not been enjoyable. Waiting and waiting. I respect your time by coming early to my appointment, I expect my time to be respected too... Whether it's a Saturday and I'm not working or not. Will probably be changing my PCP. :-(
0 ||| The one thing that cannot be disputed about Lim's -- a well-established restaurant in the West Valley -- is that the service is very friendly.  \n\nOkay:  that was the generous part of this review.  Buckle your seatbelt:  this isn't going to be a smooth ride.\n\nOnce again, my theorem about YELP has been confirmed:  the more stars a restaurant has, the more you should avoid it.  I'm convinced that every prisoner released from Sheriff Joe's tent city is promised a $20 bill for their first night's meal in freedom, PROVIDED they write a review on YELP.  How else can one explain the 4 and 5 stars for this place?  Certainly, it couldn't be for the fluorescent lit diner atmosphere ... and it certainly couldn't be for the food ... could it?!?\n\nThe Hot n Sour soup was okay.  My partner thought it too sour.  Hello!  The \"sour\" isn't in the name to make it sound pretty.  I didn't think it too sour at all and they certainly don't skimp on ingredients:  the soup is loaded.  From there, however, it started going downhill faster than a snowball down the side of a steep ski run.\n\nThe egg rolls, too, weren't bad ... a bit greasy, but filled almost exclusively with cabbage, which I like.  But the two dishes specifically mentioned in reviews here -- the Devil Beef and the Mu Shu Pork -- were as disappointing as a visit to the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food matched the Senate's performance, too.  Even before I could open my mouth, my other half said what I was thinking when they brought the beef out:  \"My God!  It looks like someone's already eaten it!\"  Mushy, grey, and in spite of the jalapenos in it, bland.  Sort of like Senator John McCain, except it wasn't demanding we go to war in Syria.  And while it is advertised in the menu, Chinese food with ... jalapenos?!?  Chinese-Mexican fusion?!?!  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork was something I'd never seen before in the many years I've eaten Chinese:  pre-rolled Mu Shu.  Usually, they bring you the wrapping and the filling is on the side and you make it yourself.  Not here:  they do it for you.  That by itself might have been acceptable to all but the Mu Shu Pork fanatic.  But what wasn't acceptable was the salt level in the food.  Unless you have a high tolerance for salty food, prepare to have lots of water nearby and watch your blood pressure go into the 150s over 110!\n\nService was fast, but almost like something out of a bad comedy about Chinese restaurants:  everything was brought at once, regardless of how close you were to finishing the previous course.  The only thing they DIDN'T do was observe you from a distance and wait for you to finish eating.\n\nIt pains me to give a bad review to a restaurant, which is obviously trying to please its customers.  In this case, however,  I'm afraid the review is fully justified.  I don't know who the people are on here, who think this is quality food.  I can only say to that one person, for example, who said he/she wishes this place was closer so he/she didn't have to drive all the way here:  KEEP DRIVING!  \n\nI rarely leave food on my plate and, when I do, I always ask for a doggie bag to take the leftovers home.  In this case, I left food on the plate and almost shouted \"no\" too enthusiastically when I was asked if I needed a box to take the remainder home.  Oh God in Heaven:  NO!!!!!
0 ||| This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.
0 ||| Been a Cox customer many years, recently moved and needed internet service at the new home, have my own modem/router, get a call from them stating a tech will be at the new house to hook me up, needed a time frame, they said absolutely nothing about a 60 dollar house call charge, for pete's sake, for years they only needed your modem number and you could easily just do it yourself, well they already had my modem number, i was transferring service, the tech showed up on time and asked which jack I planned on using for the modem, it wasn't until a month later when we decided to move the computer upstairs and needed the connection from comp to modem hardwired since the wife works from home and needs the most reliable of connections, all other jacks in the house are dead, only the one works, so had a chat session with Cox, they will be happy to send out a tech to make that new jack live so I can use it for 60.00 tech charge, I told them to screw off, I noticed the last tech cut a bunch of lines into the box, left the coaxial ends in the rocks too, I'll bet ten to one that before he showed up the entire house was live at all jacks, and I'm still trying to figure out how I went from 32.99 per month for internet only to 62.99, nearly a 100 percent increase. Google, we need you to come to Phoenix and give cox some friendly competition.
4 ||| The best Korean food in Vegas. Clean and great service .A place that I would go back to.
3 ||| \"A Tall Drink of Brunette and a Bugs Bunny Special\"\n\nA week ago my parents sent me a birthday card. Enclosed was a check and short note: 'It's your birthday. Don't behave.'\n\nI'll do my best, Maw and Paw.\n\nI worked late that cloudy Monday of March, and after work I stopped to get my Crown Vic's oil changed. Then I went to the bank, then to the car wash, and then proceeded to drive around in a funk. Didn't want to go home, didn't know where to go. Wasn't up for The Strip, wasn't up for one of my regular watering holes. I hadn't told anyone it was my birthday so I was free from required appearances.\n\nSo I drove down 215, windows open, music off. I saw Green Valley Ranch Hotel/Casino in the distance. It had been a few years since my last visit so I decided to stop in.\n\nAfter parking on the top floor I strode through the massive doors. The casino floor was pretty empty. Typical for a Monday at an off-strip casino. I plucked a twenty from my pocket and stuck it in a Wheel of Fortune machine. No lie: I sat there for over an hour on the same twenty. Made it up to 95 bucks before watching it whittle down to nothing. No matter. I might be a lot of things but hard up for cash was never one of them.\n\nIt was around 6 PM and I was hungry. I kept thinking of my parents' request not to behave so I decided to drop some major deniro at Hank's. I walked in, found a seat at the bar, and stared at some NCAA basketball. \n\nA word about Hank's: It's expensive, tastefully decorated, sanguine. Here's a look: http://greenvalleyranch.sclv.com/dining/hanks/?utm_source=YELP&utm_medium=SOCIAL&utm_term=GVR&utm_content=GVR-PROPERTIES&utm_campaign=GVR-YELP\nNot a lot of seating, great wine selection, pretty servers. As for the latter, mine was a tall drink of brunette. Wondrous curves with tresses to match. What a masterpiece. I asked for a glass of Red Rock and looked through the menu. All sorts of interesting and pricey selections. \n\nThe decision: crab cakes to start, dry aged bone-in NY--medium, mac and cheese. I gave Tall Drink my order and she moved like a swan to fill it.\n\nIn the meantime, I sipped my drink, watched the games, and smiled at Tall Drink.\n\nEnter crab cakes.\n\nKind of on the small side, one with a small garden atop, some yellow sauce beneath. I wish they had been larger with more sauce but they were good. Not too dry, not too moist. \n\nEnter steak and mac/cheese. \n\nBoth were too salty in my opinion.\n\nThe meat was correctly cooked and had good flavor. But too much salt.\n\nThe mac and cheese had a fantastic cheese taste but too much salt.\n\nI guess people must like their food salty but I'm not one of them. Nevertheless, I did like dipping my meat in the cheese sauce every third or fourth forkful. Such an act would likely cause gourmets to pass out but I don't care. And despite the sodium content I did manage to temper its power with some good old black pepper.\n\nI ate every crumb and asked for a dessert menu. Easy choice. Bugs Bunny Special, aka carrot cake. What's up, Doc?! And wow was that a big slab of decadent goodness! Fine cream cheese with a nice dollop of whipped cream on the side. Fantastic!\n\nI finished my beer and asked Tall Drink for the bill. It was around 100 bucks and with tip even more. But I was told not to behave, remember?\n\nAnyway, I paid and rose to leave, but not without smiling at TD a final time. I'm sure she awaits my return with patient desire.\n\nAnd I shall return one day. Perhaps with an even greater desire to misbehave....
3 ||| This is such a great concept. Kind of sad we went when NO ONE was there, but it was really nice place to grab a drink. Best thing...NO COVER! It's in the middle of the casino. There is a live DJ mixing it up. \n\nI really liked the way the whole area was decorated. The dance floor is lighted, since no one was there we realized that the floor lights up based on the weight of the dancers and lights up special when you stnad over the different boxes. \n\nMy favorite thing to do after I'm done dancing the night away? Get a Malibu and pineapple and sit in a big comfy couch. There were a ton of couches that you didn't have to reserve! Big plus! If you don't feel like paying the cover for foundation room or you've hit rum jungle one too many times, this is a nice cool spot. Definitely going again!
4 ||| We have been My Gym members at the District for over 4 years and Jeremy is the best!  He works really hard at keeping the kids engaged and active.  Every week the class is different and exciting.  Both of my kids LOVE this place and I feel it has helped them develop very important life skills, both mentally and physically.  The environment is clean, bright and fun.  (great music)  Some people believe it's pricey, but I don't think anything in town compares to the value received.  I've tried many different clubs/classes/sports and My Gym is consistently better for the quality of instruction & fun.  My boys never nap and they leave My Gym tired. Bonus!
4 ||| I was beyond impressed with this place! I had the unfortunate experience of getting side swiped leaving my poor car with a scrape down its side. Gerber is teamed with Geico, the insurer for the guy who hit me, and I was told to come in, drop off my car, and they would have a rental waiting for me. Everything went exactly as they said. I dropped my car off and was on the road again within 10 minutes. The repairs went relatively quickly for what they had to do and when I picked it up I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The main thing that I loved about them was their follow through. If they said they were going to call on Tuesday afternoon they called on Tuesday afternoon. I would use and recommend them to anyone!
0 ||| Tried to redeem a voucher I purchased on Living Single, they denied it. Instead they tried to upsell me to pay twice what I paid on Living Social. They also wouldn't refund the price of the voucher.
4 ||| I didn't want to yelp about this spot as I always called it my families little secret. But with the line and obivously the huge amount of reviews, it is no secret.  \n\nThis is a stop EVERYTIME I am in Vegas. Food is just amazing. Yeah yeah, Palace Station. I thought that the first time too. But this place is crazy delicious. Half dozen oysters for me with splitting something and that fills me up. \n\nI know I have had the gumbo, jumbalya, etoufee and I want to say I tried something else the last time I was in town but cant remember what it was. However I know my girlfriend looked at me with a food smile I have never seen.  She loved it! \n\nMake it a stop everytime you are in Vegas. Just hope your luck is used on the tables and not showing up here when there is no line.
0 ||| I have been waiting since Mon. For accounting to return my phone call it is Thurs. Even escalated it to a manager he still hasn't returned my phone calls! \nI don't think this is a corporate renaissance!!  Feels like a franchise!  But I need someone to take ownership of this Marriott rewards issue!  Not the first time I have stayed here & always have a billing issue!!!! Never fails!!! **BEWARE****\nThe front desk personnel don't know correct information about their rewards program! Glad I am writing this so I'll remember why this will be the last hotel I choose to stay at when in Vegas.
4 ||| Food was pretty good.  Service was great.  Will go back again. Not very wide selection of beer thou.
3 ||| Just had dinner last night here.  The Pinot Grigio just ok BUT THE FOOD was really good.  I would receomend this resturant to anyone.
0 ||| Would give 0 stars if an option.  Really tried to like this place as its close to my home and prices seem reasonable.   Unfortunately the service is by far the worst I've ever experienced.   The waiters/waitress definitely make it very clear that placing an order is a huge inconvenience to them (I'm sorry but isn't that their job?).  It felt like pulling teeth to get anyones attention.  I was able to try 2 rolls which were good, wanted to try another but after waiting a long time to get anyones attention I decided I was done spending any more money at this place.  I was with a friend who decided to order more food and kept thanking the waiter but everytime she did he kept rolling his eyes and throwing her orders down on the table...never once smiled or acknowledged her thanks.  If this business wants to succeed in their current location I suggest getting new staff.  I for one will not return to this establishment and will be surprised if they are still in operation in a few months, no one should pay for terrible service.
2 ||| Excellent food as always
3 ||| Love the Mac and Cheese.
4 ||| The greatest sandwich I have ever had my entire life. The owner is super nice and every person that works there treats you like a human being and not just a sale. Chris was so nice when he gave me my food and checked on me and asked how my food was. I plan on trying everything on the menu. The pesto sandwich was amazing. Chris recommended to chipotle next. I Know Where I'm GOING tomorrow!
2 ||| Like the convenience and prices on some items. Disappointing that they don't take manufacturer coupons.  Some items are missing (low cal, low carb, etc)
3 ||| A very nice place. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, my salad was nice and fresh and my guess enjoyed their meals also. The view is very nice if you get a window seat and the service is very efficient and I would recommend it to a friend. Anytime you're in Charlotte stop by and have a nice meal there.
0 ||| ONE WORD: TERRIBLE.\n\nAside from the hostess being very pleasant, I can't say a positive thing about this place.  The server was determined to act as disinterested as possible and the food was equally unimpressive.  \n\nMy wife ordered matzoh ball soup which was basically Campbell's basic chicken noodle with a dough ball plopped in the middle.  Okay, so maybe it's best to stick to the traditional American fare at a place called \"Red, White, and Blue\".  Unfortunately that didn't work either as the burger and onion rings I had tasted just as plain as what you'd get from the frozen food aisle of your local grocery store.  Pretty disappointing considering the soup cost $10 and the burger was $16.  \n\nAside from bringing the food, the server refilled drinks once and then brought us the check.  Didn't ask if we wanted additional drinks, to order dessert, or anything else.  He seemed fairly annoyed at the presence of anyone in his section.  Perhaps it distracted his football-watching on a Sunday afternoon.  The mumbling and avoidance of all eye contact and acknowledgment was a pretty nice bonus too.  I guess there's a first time for everything and this was my first time eating at a full-service restaurant without leaving a tip. \n\nOverall, by far the worst place I've eaten in Vegas both food and service-wise.
2 ||| The fish tacos are really good.  It's just a shame this place is in a Wal-Mart parking lot because the riff raff like to eat here.  On our visit one guy was in handcuffs detained by the police outside (for a non-fish taco related incident) and there were about 20 people crowded around the few tables waiting for someone to leave so they could sit.  Those fish tacos are solid though.
0 ||| Stopped by eat w/three of my friends and we all left horribly disappointed. Not only was our waitress rude, condescending, unwelcoming, and clearly hated her job but the service was slow and the fact that there was no options for vegans was disappointing to say the least. When I asked the waitress if there was any vegan options she rudely stated \"we have salad.\"  Clearly she had no idea what vegan meant as the salad on the menu had animal products in it.  I had to settle for a $7 bowl of oatmeal which they served to me with carmelized apples/pecans (carmelization requires the use of butter...an animal byproduct) which irritated me to no end as I already stated I was vegan and ordered it plain.  We were also never offered refills on our water or coffee, and halfway through our meal our waitress abandoned our table and never came back.  The staff has no regard for your concerns. The four of us agreed we will definitely not be going back.
1 ||| So, I got a bill in the mail saying that my Culinary Insurance wouldn't approve the inserts. Culinary Insurance does not cover inserts at the Good Feet Store starting on Jan, 1st 2013, buyer's beware!!!! Currently fighting the bill due to authorization issues and so forth. Lot's of headaches going through this process. Go see a quality podiatrist instead and get insoles from them. It's the same stuff, plus the Culinary Insurance will accept it.
2 ||| My problem with this is everytime I go in, there is either like three or four dudes standing around by the door that all say \"hi\" at the same time or no one around. \n\nAlso, someone's always coughing.\n\nOther than that, its a great place and usually has a nice group. Nice locker rooms and convenient location. LA fitness is the best because of thier hours, pool, and equipment. I like how they keep the cardio away from the weights because I never use weights. Thier treadmills and eliptical machines are good quality.
2 ||| I'd have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers. Suede is a decent restaurant if you're staying at the Westin but not worth the trip if you aren't staying at the hotel.\n\nWe had the $18.00 breakfast buffet. It had all the essentials: eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, toast, fruit, waffles. I would've like a few more options but for the price (in Vegas) it was worth it. I thought everything tasted very good and our server was extremely nice and friendly. \n\nIf I return to the Westin, I will certainly hit up this place again for breakfast.
2 ||| In total loser fashion... I decided to order some delivery from here. A large Corde De Lane... Is that spelled right? lol... Pretty much its a French Dip Sandwich. They took a lot faster than I thought they would - less than 30 minutes. yay!\n\nThe beef was very tender and thinly sliced. The provolone cheese that I ordered to go with it was way yummy too! My only complaint was that the aju was a little too salty. I also would like it if they actually had sized that made sense... who wants an 8\" or 11\" sub?? How about 6 or 12 inch sub?! \n\nThe food was yummy and I'll definatly be ordering from them again! Especially considering they are open all hours of the night and deliver until 3! :D whoo hoo!!
2 ||| Look.  It's nothing more than a $13-a-burger burger joint. Pretty nice burger. Not the best.
2 ||| If you work in the restaurant or baking business, chances are you have heard of or have purchased items from Chef Rubber. They carry a wide selection of items (i.e., baking equipments, cooking tools, molecular gastronomy ingredients, rare or hard to find cookbooks).\n\nMost of the people do business with Chef Rubber through online purchases, but they do have a physical location in Las Vegas (even if it is located in a non-descript commercial building with a really small Chef Rubber logo.  Taking a cab here is possible, but not recommended, as trying to get a cab on the way back is difficult without calling for one from dispatch.\n\nThey also offer classes, like chocolate and pulled sugar, taught by some very talented pastry chefs.  I know Chef Jin Caldwell (world class chocolatier and Head Chocolatier at Ethel M's) have taught the chocolate classes here (not sure if she still has the time to teach here).  But these are geared towards industry professionals that want to improve their skills.\n\nI can literally spend an entire afternoon just looking at all the cool stuff on their shelves.  But prices for items is definitely not cheap. But what you get in return for their healthy markups is the wide selections under one roof.\n\n\nLocation:  3/5 Worth the drive if you live in Las Vegas.  Otherwise just buy it online and have it shipped.\nPrice: 2/5  Pricey.\nSelection: 4.5/5  They have a lot of stuff!
0 ||| This was the WORST experience ever. I purchased a Groupon for a lunch special and the waitress refused to honor it.  She told me that I was required to have 2 people present in order to redeem the voucher---this was not true.  The voucher said that I needed to order 2 entrees.  It said nothing about needing 2 people.  She was stubborn, ignorant of the Groupon deal, and unwilling to serve me.  I reported the restaurant to Groupon, and they said that they have reported the incident internally.  A review may be underway if other Groupon customers have additional unsavory experiences.  I obviously can't tell you about the food, but the service was really awful! Buyers beware!
0 ||| This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. \n\nI had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). \n\nService is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. \nMy family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same. I mean there wasn't even a piece of orange or parsley or melon on my plate like there usually is when you order breakfast at any other breakfast place
4 ||| Simply put, this store is amazing. Stylish, classy, and comfortable clothing at VERY reasonable prices. They have a lot of workout gear, in addition to everyday clothing. My parents sent me several things from here for my birthday last month, and my mom wanted to take me on my recent visit since I loved everything they sent. They had a great sale going on, and I can tell you I did not leave empty handed (good thing I had half of an empty suitcase to fill)!! All of the clothing sold here is incredibly comfortable and is good for the young and not-so-young. The employees are super friendly and give honest opinions on what looks good- or not.\n\nI hope they open more of these stores across the country!
4 ||| Mmmm Cassis! Great food, really fresh.\n\nSome of the servers that have been there for a while can be a little eh, but they've since hired some new meat and they are great! Super attractive too!\n\nThis place has a pretty decent selection and I've always enjoyed myself!
4 ||| The show was worth every penny! I'm just sad I didn't have enough to buy my cousins and brothers tickets. I ended up going just me and my boyfriend. I was excited as soon as my boyfriend and I walked in. They set a fun, intimate atmosphere. Lucky for us, we got bumped up to front row seats..the stage was only a few arm lengths away. It was crazy seeing what these performers can do. I can hardly pick a favorite act because it was all so good. The humor in between acts is very crass and vulgar- if that isn't your thing, maybe don't go... Myself, on the other hand was laughing my ass off like crazy. You go from laughing your ass off to being totally mesmerized in the acts. The performances are truly beautiful and sexy and mind blowing.
4 ||| I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!
3 ||| Just happen to run across Nana's as it was in the vicinity of where I was, and I thought it was delish!  It was a great value for $10 to where I left full, and got a sample of true souther comfort food w/out feeling weighed down or overstuffed. The fried chicken was some of te best I've had - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - and tasty sides. The small cornbread was sweet enough that it scratched a dessert itch without having to buy a dessert. It was simple and tasty. To boot the service was friendly and fun.
2 ||| After passing by this spot numerous times while getting a Fat Tuesday, I finally gave it a shot. \n\nI ordered the Connecticut. Total came to nearly $18! (But then again it's Vegas) For that price my expectations were somewhat high.\n\nI encountered a pretty long waiting time for ordering and getting my food. The roll was really good! Not salty and doused in butter like I expected and the toasted bread was perfect. The size disappointed me, wasn't even the size of a 6 inch subway sandwich.\n\nWorth my money? \n\nNot quite. Not enough to fill you up, not mouth-watering enough to make you feel like your money was worth it. With Earl of Sandwich just around the corner I'd rather go there and get an entire meal for less than one sandwich at this spot.\n\nDefinitely not a bang for buck spot but if money is not an issue I would come back. \nIf I do come back I want to try the Mac N Cheese and lobster on a stick.
2 ||| Three stars because of the size of the museum, not the quality of the wax figures. Just felt like there should have been more. Also...not sure about that J-Lo statue. I only realized it was her when I saw it from behind.\n\nBut that said, it's a wax museum. And it's an awesome chance to take ridiculous pictures with friends. Like Hugh Hefner lounching on a love seat? Come on.\n\nNot surprising discovery: I am as tall as Shaq's nipple.\n\nSurprising discovery: I am shorter than Bieber. Fail.
3 ||| I'd put a 4.5 star rating if it was available.\n\nThe knocked off half star would be because out of 5 visits or more, one time the pecan crusted trout came out under cooked and bland. I did arrive a bit late and I believe the kitchen was trying to close. I don't feel like a 945pm arrival time for 1030pm closing is that bad. maybe they were trying to close early due to a slow turn out.\n\nEvery item I've had here is yummy. Yesterday I came here and got the $36 alaskan king crab legs. They were very yummy (not the best I've had, but a damn steal for that price!)\n\nThe ambiance is great for a date.\n\nSome wet naps would of been really nice after the crab legs, but oh well, i don't knock off points there.\n\nI love the arnold palmer. I think the lemonade is their restaurant recipe, and it really gives a great after taste with the arnold palmer.
2 ||| If grandma's creative brain exploded on a Sunday afternoon, this is what it would look like.  They have paints, glues for any surface or material, brushes, picture frames all shapes and sizes, seasonal arts and crafts, beads and bedazzlers, candles galore, styrofoam in weird shapes and blocks, construction paper, wood shelving that you can stain or color any way you like, fake flowers, glass containers, etc.  Also, if you're into scrap-booking Michael's is probably a dream come true.
3 ||| Big, clean, carries lots of variety. Some is overpriced, the rest is about average.
2 ||| This location of Jimmy John's is a regular lunch stop when I am working in the Northwest. Clean shop, friendly staff, quick service.\n\nI love turkey, I don't like ham or super salty meats (read: Italian meats) on my sandwiches (except bacon of course!). Jimmy John's has a nice selection of sandwiches with turkey on them. Here are my faves:\n\nTurkey Tom - simple...turkey, cheese, regular fixins\nBeach Club - turkey, cheese, avo, cukes, sprouts...a California Girl's sandwich dream\nClub Lulu - turkey, bacon, regular fixins\nBootlegger - turkey, roast beef, regular fixins\n\nFresh ingredients, good portion of meat (for me), lots of veggies, extra peppers please! Quality sandwich place.
1 ||| Fancy place.  Not great food. \n\nThis place is a fancy, expensive Mexican restaurant for people what to spend more money than they should and get far less than good Mexican food.  I guess if you're from Minnesota, Wisconsin or BC this is passible, but it is far from good Mexican food.
4 ||| This place deserves all the 5 star reviews is it has.\n\nEsther, the server, was excellent. Timely, friendly, she knows the food, and made great suggestions. We tired the pofpofs, meat pies, yassa, curried chicken, and fufu. Everything was very, very delicious. The meat pies, and yassa where my favorite. Very good quality food, especially for the price.  \n\nIf you are not scared to try new things, put a leg out there, this place is for you. But even if you are a more conservative person, try it, the best things in life are always unexpected.
1 ||| THIRTEEN places that sell SHOES??? Run down, small, hard to get in and out of and clientele is very low on the socioeconomic ladder. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess!
0 ||| Oh I forgot how much I hate you! \n\nYou've  yet again managed to ruin another family vacation! I promised myself the last time that I would never fly you again.  But somehow I forgot. \n\nDelayed due to a malfunctioning generator?? Really and now you want me to go 5 hours cross country on you with my offspring! I will never ever fly you again.\n\nMissing the AZ diamondback game was the least of my worries.  Thinking that I was flying on an old decrepit plane....yeah pretty much occupied my mind.\n\nYour staff is rude.  You didn't even offer us a FREE snack after delaying us for 3 hours.  \n\nYou made me want to write Jet Blue a love letter, asking for forgiveness because I cheated with a lesser quality airline.  I will never fly you again and OH I won't forget!!
1 ||| Today was only my second visit to this location. My family just moved to Charlotte in June and frequented the location where we used to live. \n\nFirst visit was great, very friendly staff and welcoming when I mentioned we were new to Charlotte. I was happy to know I would have a great place to bring my 5 yr olds toys and clothes. \n\nToday was a different story!! I realize it is a Saturday (weekends are usually busy) but there appeared to be lots of staff on hand, but not much business taking place. I was sorely disappointed and left with a bag full of items that will go to Goodwill. Once Upon a Child needs to show \"a little\" regard for their customers and their time.
3 ||| I ordered a regular(7\"-$6.95) Big Kahuna Cheese Steak to go. It has grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalapenos and extra cheese. It was really good. The bread wasn't even soggy and it took me 20 minutes to get home!
4 ||| Love coming here food is always good no complaints here at all...And so awesome that all this worth the drive  thank you guys..
1 ||| I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese.  When one of the dishes arrived and she didn't like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter (in Chinese).  After that the food was exceptional.  Easily the best Chinese food I've had in Central Illinois.  (I admit, that's a low standard.)\n\nHowever, I've never been able to recreate this experience.  And how I've tried!  I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu.  I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself.  But the food is never as good.  I expect it was the shouting.  Now that my friend has moved away, I expect it will never be that good again.\n\nWithout my friend to help us, this is a mediocre place.
4 ||| I don't eat sashimi so I can't comment on their fish quality, but I do like cooked rolls and luckily Sushi San has a wide selection.  All the rolls I've tried are delicious and you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nWhat stands out the most to me about this restaurant is their amazing customer service.  I usually order to go and sometimes find \"extras\" in my bag, such as miso soup, edamame, or even an entire extra roll!  The staff is super friendly and it's rare these days to find a restaurant with such a stellar level of customer service.
2 ||| I went here for dinner.  I had the steak with risotto.... I ate it all.\n\nIt was good. Meh.  It was good.  I don't know.  I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that it was indeed good because I wanted it so much for it to be REALLY good... but it was good.
4 ||| I go to Cassie every time I'm in that side of town or go out of my way to go there she has always done an amazing job I trust her with my eyebrows it's a clean and friendly environment
2 ||| 3.5\nService was okay. It was really busy so the server forgot a few things, but she always apologized. \n\nWe had ordered hummus with seared ahi tuna. Hummus was okay & the tuna (separately) was okay considering this type of restaurant, but the tuna & hummus was a weird combo. The portion is pretty large. The chipotle black bean burger was the other dish that was ordered, and it was good ($8).
2 ||| My 5th time to Vegas and first time staying at Planet Hollywood. It's a great deal for being in the middle of the strip but the walls are thin and the bathroom vents are connected so you can hear conversations. That was the most negative part of the stay. Maybe if you upgrade to a better room you won't hear your neighbors. Miracle mile shops are convenient and surprisingly not overpriced! Clean room, nice staff, but our room had a lame Speed 2 theme. No luck there! Stay here for an average price and average experience.
3 ||| Good food, with the usual good variety of beer choices available in Madison.  Get there early if you're with a large group, the large tables go quickly.  As usual for Madison bars, I love the no smoking law :-)
4 ||| I've been here countless times (well, no, you could count) because it's right near my job. There is always a line because the plaza is poorly designed with minimal parking; the line of cars often spills over into the flow of traffic. That's not SBUX's fault though. \n\nThe staff is great--especially CLAUDIA. They're really courteous and always get my drink order correct. They've had some turnover in recent months, but at least the hiring manager consistently hires good people.
0 ||| This place is as rough as a badgers arse. \n\nInside, Balfours Bar is deffinatly a place where you come to drink away your sorrows through the day so that you can pass out at night. You dont talk to anybody and you dont make eye contact with anybody. When you do have to make your intentions clear you do so in a muttered grumble where the only distinguishable words are rude or about urinating. When you need to smoke go outside and blinkingly step into the early morning sunlight, stare menicingly at passers by and shout at each other. You then return inside and be mean to the barstaff who are trying thier hardest not to cry and quit.\n\nGo home instead of drink here.
3 ||| This shop has almost all art supplies you may need. They also have a student discount which is a pro. All the stock is very good quality and hence comes with a slightly higher price than you may find say in a supermarket. Keep your eyes peeled for notices for various art classes and art exhibitions. \n\nThey have a very big selection of these amazing Japanese marker pens, which I can never get enough. The shopkeeper is lovely and chatty, and if you can't find anything, it's best to ask, because the shops small size makes it quite crammed with stuff.\n\n All in all, a great place to quench your artistic thirst for equipment, and with the student discount it makes it a bit more affordable.
2 ||| Went there about a week ago on a Saturday night with a party of six. We had to wait around 30 mins or so for a table.  Although the food took a long time to reach the table, the server was very good and checked on us frequently.  Management stopped by to apologize too.  We were having a good time so the wait wasn't a big deal. It was extremely crowded. The chips and salsa were good and picante. The food was just ok. Nothing special. I had a roasted chicken burrito.  Chuy's is a good place if you want to hang out with some friends and have something to eat  but if you want a good Mexican meal, look elsewhere.
3 ||| My Favorite Shop: I have been a long time fan of this company. It wasn't until a misplaced suite jacket led me to this location inside of Ceasar's Palace/Forum Shops that I realized how much I liked this store - especially this location. We entered the shop about half an hour before they were to close. After living in HI for so long I had misplaced most of my dress clothes. I realized my dinner & show reservations for the next night asked that men wear a jacket. Needless to say I needed help. I am not one for shopping. However, the selection & helpful staff were so great that I ended up with virtually a new wardrobe instead of just a jacket for the next night and happy about it. Good lighting helped me find just the right hues & colors. Wide designer selection provided the variety to dress well & not look like an ad for a specific designer. I am especially fond of the house brand for dress pants. The music was good. The staff here was wonderful. Helpful but not pushy. The man helping us had a good eye for piecing together outfits for casual & dress occasions. The sales associate even tracked down a cool drink for my girlfriend when needed. The oversized chairs were a nice addition to rest in while awaiting suggestions from the salesman. When I realized I had kept them there almost 45 minutes past closing I began my appologies & they assured me that it was their pleasure to assist. WOW! Many stores kick you out after a few minutes past closing & these men were as helpful & freindly as when we first walked in the door. The tailor even had my clothes ready the very next day. Great service. All in all a terrific shopping experience. I will most assuredly be shopping here again.
1 ||| Meh.. that about sums up my thoughts on this place. \n\nI am not really a huge fan of sandwich restaurants, so maybe that influences my feelings. It is pretty much another Quiznos ... sandwich, chips, drink... My sandwich was good, but it was not amazing. I prefer Subway honestly. With Chipotle and The Habit right next to it, I probably will not be back.
4 ||| Doesn't look like much from the outside, but serves up awesome food.\n\nOn a recommendation from DarrenC, I tried this place.  I drove right past it on my first pass, totally didn't even notice the little stand-alone building sitting back from Broadway in the ghetto.  They have burgers, BBQ, Catfish, sandwiches, etc.  The owner is, apparently, a preacher and likes to blast emotional, uplifting gospel-type music which, surprisingly, adds to the enjoyment of the place, and I am not a fan of church or religion.\n\nOh, and the best part.... they serve up sweet tea.  If you work around here, just try it, you will be adding it to your rotation, guaranteed.
0 ||| Unless you have no other options, don't come here. The place looks old and dirty and the food is NOT good. I had the taco salad which was basically iceberg lettuce, canned olives, dried shredded chicken and one scoop of guacamole and sour cream. Ick! I rather go across the street to the 711 and grab a bag of chips and beef jerky.
4 ||| The deli and restaurant are my favourite lunch spots in town (although all of it's incarnations are great choices)\n\nThe menu is very varied with plenty options for even the pickiest of eaters. The food is always tasty, fresh, hearty and healthy.  They always seem to get the perfect flavour/combination of flavours! Portions are generous and definitely good value for money.\n\nStaff are all very friendly, knowledgeable and happy to meet your needs and answer any questions about their dishes.\n\nFor a healthy and satisfying meal, you won't find better. The Deli also offers a take-away service which comes in very handy for an office lunch.
0 ||| Absolutely horrible. Spent $1000 to rent a 2014 Jaguar XJL for 2 days. Brought it back on time and full of gas. 3 days later I'm getting over $1200 worth of charges on my card from Hertz. Then a day later an automated \"urgent\" phone call saying I never returned the car. Seriously?!? It takes 4 days for them to realize an $85,000.00 luxury car wasn't returned??? Considering it was already returned, I don't know what's worse. The fact that is was and they had no clue or the fact that it took a machine 4 days to call me asking about it. After multiple attempts to reach the people at the actual Hertz desk at the airport without going through the 800 number and talking to someone in Michigan. I finally had to take time out of my day to drive back down to the airport only to wait in line and then speak to a manager. Never in my life have I met a more lazy, incompetent, unapologetic manger (Veronica). When I walked up she was sitting down in her chair at the desk(no other employee was sitting even though they all had chairs at their computers) I explain the situation and she proceeds to make 4 different phone calls trying to locate the \"unreturned\" car. After she finds it she informs me it was put to the side so parts could be ordered for it. She asks the person on the other line if she needs to charge me for the parts? Yes apparently I stole the cupholder out of the jag which they valued at $80. Yea ya know they're right that jaguar cup holder just looks and fits so good in my Mercedes. (If you didn't pick up on it that was sarcasm)\n\nAfter much argument she told me I chose coverage for the car when I rented it so I'm not responsible for the cupholder. After wasting quite enough time I asked for a printed invoice of my final bill. She then says she doesn't have a printer. Really you don't have a printer? There is literally over 20 computers at the hertz desk. \"I don't have a printer but she does\" pointing to an employee next to us helping other people. Bottom line is she was to lazy to stand up and move to one of the other 18 open computers and print my receipt. She told another guy to walk over and do it. Bottom line she was incredibly rude, lazy, disrespectful and made no attempt to offer an apology for the huge mistake and waste of time on my part. After asking at the very end \"so no apology what so ever? She offered a measly \"sorry\" \n\nVeronica please do us all a favor and resign or learn some basic manners, take a little more initiative and learn to offer an apology when you know your company is in the wrong.
4 ||| ABSOLUTE FAVORITE STEAK HOUSE OF ALL TIME!\nAmazing steaks! Extremly intresting and delicious appetizers and desserts!\nVERY EXPENSIVE!
0 ||| This gym has the worst customer service and a bunch of idiots working there.  I cancelled my membership 4 times as I did not have faith in the idiots working and was confirmed July would be my last payment.  Well last night August 2 guess what? they took another payment.  When I called the idiot at the desk said sorry there is nothing we can do.  So now because they are so stupid I have to close my checking account and open a new one and transfer all my drafts.  If you want yo get robbed and deal with shitty service join this low class gym.
1 ||| The quality vs value of this place has completely plummetted in recent times and I had a very disappointing visit a few weeks ago. I had met a couple of friends for lunch who had never been here before. Told them that it was one of the best soul food places I've ever been to, which at time of stating had been quite true. I've been coming here for about seven or eight years and I remember when the food used to cost $8.80 per plate - AND after your meal someone was always walking around offering the dessert of the day to everyone. Quaint and tasty and decently priced. Now, everything is almost double that, over $14 per plate. And the flavours have gone downhill. I told these guys the cornbread at Mrs White's was all-world. Out comes stale shitty cornbread that I guarantee was made the previous day - we got there at just after 11am so I KNOW it wasn't fresh. One of my friends asked for mac and cheese, they didn't have it. Also didn't have red beans and rice, which is what I normally order. Um, ok. I asked for smothered chicken. The other two asked for fried chicken. Out come three plates of fried chicken. I was too hungry to care. Then the guy comes out and says they DO have mac and cheese. Whatever. Collard greens aren't flavourful at all - almost like something steamed out of a Green Giant freezer pack. Fried chicken was okay, but not anything better than Church's and three times the price. And nobody offered any dessert, not that we would have had it anyway.\n\nThe bill for all three of us came to $48!! For basically something I could have cobbled together myself and I'm not even kidding. Kraft mac and cheese would have been tastier. Fried chicken takes a little while but isn't rocket science. Collard greens are a twenty-five cent side, and I almost broke my tooth on the cornbread. This place went from a treat to a disaster in one horrible visit. Won't be back unless and until they literally halve their prices and go back to the quality hole-in-the-wall they used to be. At least they accept credit cards now - only took them a half century to figure that out. And to top it off, their website is just as jacked up as their prices. 2 stars.
2 ||| Here's the thing,  The food is outstanding.  BUT...\n\n1.  It is fairly expensive.\n2.  The service is slow\n3.  I don't like their fries.  Why won't they let me substitute one of many available sides even if i pay extra?  \n4.  the menu now has half the items and that is lame.\n5.  When i went there after they first opened, the service was exceptional, now it is almost like they are trying to go out of business.  \n\nI still have gone about 7 times and will continue to go.  You just can't find that food elsewhere.
3 ||| I can only give this hotel 4 stars because I didn't stay here and didn't get the full Cosmopolitan experience. I can imagine that it's worth all 5 stars, but I can't know for sure just yet. I did however visit the casino a few times during the day and night. It's gorgeous inside with strands of crystals hanging from the ceiling like you are actually inside a chandelier. OMG I loved it, sooo pretty. The clubs and shops inside were top notch and most probably out of my price range, but awesome none the less. I went to the Sports Book and got to watch my team kick butt for a little while on their screen of TV's. I had bet at my casino, but The Cosmopolitan's odds were better. This place is pretty much one of the nicest hotels on the Strip right now. I walked through almost every single hotel, and this one really stood out!
4 ||| This has got to be one of the best gyms on a military base....ever!\n\nIf you've ever paid $$ for off base gyms and been to a Lifetime fitness, this gym is on par with everything minus a salon area. \n\nThey have an indoor track, out door track, multiple courts, cardio area with multiple machines, weight area (machines and free weights), classes,  indoor pool, nice lockers, and a decent cafe. There is a family workout room where munchkins are corralled and moms/dads can workout and watch their children. There are also 2 massage therapist with their own room near the lockers, I'll have to check that out on another visit :)\n\nIt is an air force gym so no towel service :(
0 ||| The WORST sushi in my life. Too undercooked sushi rice (like long-stored bad grain), not fresh,smelly and dry fish (low quality). \nWhat should I say more? In my dinner menu, wine was only thing I could eat.
4 ||| The hotel was beautiful and our stay was nothing short of amazing! \n\nHowever, this review is for the salon...\n\nI went to the Mandarin salon during our stay at the hotel in September 2013.  I figured a hotel as nice as the Mandarin would have good stylist - I was right!  The concierge at the front desk was able to help me book a cut and color appointment with Jocette.  When I met with Jocette, she took the time to not only make an assessment for the needs of my hair, but offer suggestions on ways to make it look its best.  In the end, the cut and chocolate brown color she chose looked awesome!  \n\nBut wait...she gets better!  I have been struggling to find a quality stylist in my home state of Hawaii, so I took a shot at asking Jocette if she knows any stylist on the island.  She contacted her friend that lives on Oahu and gave me recommendations.  This above and beyond service is something that will make me want to stay at the Mandarin for years to come.  Go see Jocette, she's fantastic!
3 ||| A friend made reservations at Craftsteak for our group of seven and, after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I was a little worried. Well, let me say that all of my concerns were unfounded. We were seated promptly, and the service was first rate. Our waiter was wonderful, and tended to our every need quickly and fully. We all ordered the 3 course Angus Beef dinner, and it was spectacular. The variety and quality of appetizers, side dishes, and deserts was awesome. The beef was mouth watering, and cooked to perfection. This dinner is not cheap (with wine and/or cocktails, about $200 to $250 per person), but worth it for a once a year special evening.
3 ||| It's so pretty in here. They have a good selection but everything is pricey. If you don't have a Fry's rewards card I suggest getting one. We used my aunt's number since we don't live in AZ. At least this way she'll get the fuel points and I got the discount.
0 ||| I'm not driving around town in the car I reserved because when I got off the plane (at 3 am), you didn't have it. \n\nAnd I'm like, \"Fuck you.\"\n\nI guess the money I paid wasn't enough...I'm like, \"Fuck you.\"\n\nYeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari...\nAll I wanted was a Nissan Versa in white. \nToo much to ask, for you to honor your commitment...\nThe way you play your game ain't right.\n\nClearly, Advantage knows how to TAKE the reservation, they just don't know how to HOLD the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.\n__________\n\nMy apologies to Cee-Lo and Jerry Seinfeld, without whom this review could not have been written.
3 ||| My first love is Smith & Wollensky in NY so I could only give 4 stars.  \n\nThe porterhouse was amazing.\nThe creamed spinach yummy.\n\nWe were leaning back trying to breathe after the steak but I had to try the croissant bread pudding.\nIt was worth the gluttony.\nOne of the men at the table never partakes of dessert and he ate almost half of it  !!!\n\nYou have to try it.  It is definitely 5 stars.  Yum.  Yum.\n\nThe service was fantastic, attentive and entertaining, not intrusive at all.  \n\nLooking forward to going back for an absolutely fantastic steak and dessert.
3 ||| We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome.
0 ||| I've dined at Olive Garden for many years. Not this specific location, but many others. I find that one's experience at this chain is either very good or very bad. There is no in between it seems. Went with (5) of my co-worker's for lunch. We got there relatively early so as to avoid the lunch crowd for what we thought would be about an hour dining experience. WRONG! From the moment our waiter arrived at the table, I knew this wasn't going to be good. \"Mike\" was brash and unfriendly. He seemed genuinely annoyed to have to wait on us, and it seemed like during the entire dining experience, he had much better things to do. \n\nIt took what seemed like forever to receive our drinks once he took the order. Then as soon as he took our order, he literally disappeared. We didn't see him anywhere in the restaurant. This being Arizona and hot, our drinks were quickly consumed. No Mike. wait....wait....wait some more. Finally, a server who was not ours, asked if we would like drink refils. After answering in the affirmative, waiters who were not ours, showed up with the salad bowls and breadsticks.  Mike soon showed up, and delivered a few of the extra items we had ordered, but did not have the extra dressing I requested. I politely asked again for extra dressing for my salad, he again seemed annoyed at my existence, and left. No sooner had I served myself a bowl of salad, the entree's showed up. uh....timing anyone? Salad is served and eaten first before entree's are delivered. Again, this part of the meal was served by someone other than Mike.  I had ordered the Lasagne Classico, and the serving was much smaller than I remembered, but I ate it anyway. (certainly not worth the $9.95 they soaked me for).  Halfway through the Lasagne, Mike showed up with my extra dressing. (gee...thanks). It was obvious at this time we required more drink refills but off he went again to disappear.  We again flagged down another server to refill drinks.  My dining companions who had endless soup waited nearly 20 minutes for someone to notice they might like more and that our salad bowls needed refilling.  (the salad bowls needed refilling long before) However, someone who appeared to be in management had more soup brought out and another bowl of salad and breadsticks. \n\nMike finally started coming back around and being attentive to our needs just in time to leave us our checks. Though I felt he had earned ZERO, I still left him a fair tip.\n\nWhat could have been a nice leisurely lunch was essentially ruined by our server's careless and unfriendly attitude, and the lack of good service. It seemed like everyone but our server waited on us.  And yet, we essentially we had to ask for everything before we got it. I don't feel this Olive Garden really cares about their customers or doing things the right way. Surely we are not the first customers to complain about this guy's unfriendly demeanor and constant disappearing act.  \n\nIf my co-worker's insist on returning to this particular OG in the future, we have already agreed that if they attempt to seat us in Mike's area, we are requesting a different server. Personally...I don't think I'll be back. This place just doesn't seem to care, and the smaller portions didn't wow me. There's so much better out there to choose from at lunch time, and OG should remember this.
1 ||| its was ok. not really worth all the hype\n\nPrice: a lot\nPresentation: good\nTaste: okay\nservice: okay
4 ||| Great Stay! We stayed here one night due to the close proximity to the Convention Center, we then moved to the Bellagio, and immediately moved back to Embassy Suites.\nWhat a wonderful experience. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. \nHaving the option of an evening cocktail at the Manager's special is a nice benefit, and the breakfast each morning was steaming hot and fresh, making it so convienent when needing to get to an event at the Convention Hall.\nThe workout room was clean, equipment is updated and it is included with your stay. If you are a Hilton Honors member, the wireless internet is provided at no charge, a nice added benefit. The hotel was quiet and clean. You don't have to schlepp your luggage for miles into the hotel, parking is plentiful and free. \nWe didn't mind being off the strip, it was a welcome respite from the craziness. You can easily drive to the strip, or walk to the monorail station for an evening of fun.\nWhen in Vegas again, the Embassy Suites gets my business!
3 ||| This place is awesome.  He was closed but was still there cleaning and took me in for a great old school cut.  I'd tried some salons and was relying on Sueprcuts a lot and hadn't been to a barber in quite some time.  Sure, I haven't had this kind of haircut since gradeschool, but he did clean it up quite nicely and even gave my beard a clean trim.  Definitely recommended if this is what you're looking for.  Also, some great conversation
1 ||| Mediocre fish. Super small portions.  Bland.  No atmosphere.  Good service though.
0 ||| Disgusting disgusting disgusting! I just left this place with my grandparents about 5 minutes ago and it's by far the worst Korean food I've ever had! \n\n-Slow service and there were only 5 other tables 5:30-7:00pm on a Saturday\n\n- my first plate they brought out was dirty \n\n- we order combo B, $59.99 consists of chadol, pork belly, steak, raw meat wrapped with veggies (eaten raw),  bean soup, and steamed egg + soju. We didn't want the soju so we omitted it, but they forgot the bean paste soup and steamed egg! \n\n- also ordered al jigae (pollack roe soup) and it was super salty!!!!\n\n- they brought out chikkae ( Korean sweet rice drink). My cup had lip stick print and they were so embarrassed! \n\n- overall the meat quality was merely ok. My grandma and sister stopped eating after the first bite of the gumulok (steak marinated with sesame oil) it was so chewy and had a weird distinct taste they stopped eating that.\n\nugh this place is so gross!!!!! Enough said!!!! I saw Kenny Lee the owner and I wanted to let him know how disgusting everything was.... Dirty, poor quality of meat (btw the raw meat that was supposed to be eaten raw was NOT good!!! The rim of the meat was dis colored and it was no different that the regular brisket cut that is supposed to be eaten cooked. If it was Yoo-ke.... High quality Korean raw meat with sesame oil it would be one thing but the Pyeon Chae (raw meat carpaccio) was so gross and chewy!!!!
1 ||| This place has been on my list for a few weeks because as a vegetarian, I am a sucker for natural, organic places.\n\nI wish I could say that I loved this place. I really do. I wanted to. I tried. \n\n*sigh* Didn't happen. \n\nPros:\n* The decor is cool and new.\n* They have the cool drink station with tons of beverage options.\n\nCons:\n* The vegetarian offerings are slim unless you want to eat a ton of cheesy, simple white carbs as the options are either served on white bread or are a pasta.\n* The food was very oily, which is not something i expect from a place that promotes healthy, clean food.\n* They are pricey and the servings are small.\n* NO nutrition info available anywhere. I like to know how much fat, sugar, calories are in my meals.\n* The staff was not knowledgeable about the menu. When asking questions, we were either told that they didn't know or they simply read to us off the menu.\n\nSeriously bummed out because I was so excited about trying this place and most Gilbert residents will agree that we need some good healthy options on the east side.
0 ||| This place is disgusting. It tastes like they soak everything in margarine. Avoid at all costs.
0 ||| Weak!!!!!Even though I was on the guest list they still charged me $45 to see lil Jon. Long story short. His set was super weak, the stereo is super weak, and the overall hospitality is great if you want to be treated like a piece of shit. Even if your a well dressed gentleman with some girls your still dirt in the eyes of the scumbag security fucktards. I got to a lot of shows and this was about as weak as it gets. Wow Vegas. Not impressed. Next time I won't \"Surrender\" to the bullshit this club has to offer.
0 ||| I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.
4 ||| GREAT lunch at Julian Serrano..me and my fiancee's last meal before leaving LV. Every single thing we put into our gaping maws we loved......lobster gazpacho, goat cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers, fried potatos with chorizo and fried eggs, seafood-saffron rice, bread with tomato and machego cheese, tuna/raspberry skewers, lobster/pineapple skewers....I definetily want to come back for dinner when they have a more extensive menu. The pitcher of sangria we got was $$$$ at 44 bucks, but it was huuuuugge. Service was very good and our server made good recommendations.
0 ||| Where do I start? Ok it was 8;30 pm on a Wednesday night, I ordered a glass of pinot Noir & the crab Citrus appetizer along with there (blue fine tuna dinner with wasabi mash potatoes. the crab appetizer came to the table in about 7 minutes, still waiting for my wine wtf?. Ok. They are not busy here at all just a few Guy knuckleheads at the bar loud as fk even louder than the Dj which was way way to loud for a 3/4 empty place. Ok back to the food and still no wine. ? Really ? Now my meal shows up 17-19 minutes later and still no wine. I tell my waitress what happens to my wine? OMG ITS TOTALY MY FAULT I FORGOT. I will get it for you now. really ? I reply no thanks I'm fine with my water. Now back to my tuna dinner. ? Really dinner ? Or a sushi bar appetizer with one small spoon full of wasabi mash ? Wow really $38 for this come on STK. Dont order the tuna unless you want to be starving after.  No wine and still hungry so I decided to order the apple pie. Weeeeeeek. Very weak.  Sara Lee frozen taste better. I give one star. Weak weak weak. Bogus.
3 ||| Came with friends and had a great time.  Food was amazing.  Service was good. Will be back.
4 ||| Susan is absolutely the best!  I went to Susan after a long search for a new stylist and am so pleased with my choice.  Susan is fantastic with cuts and color, I wanted to make a change from long to short and could not be happier with the result.  I have had nothing but compliments on my hair.  Susan is charming, knowledgeable and is easy to talk to.  Overall, my experience could not have been better.  I will continue to go to Susan in the future.
1 ||| This is the WORST/BEST Walmart in Arizona depending on how you look at it!\n\nThere is no such thing as \"just running in to get something\" at this store.  Even though they have the usual 20 or so check outs, I have never seen more than 2 or 3 operating at once.  Check out lines are looooong, going back into the clothing racks most of the time.\n\nI must say that the staff have always been relatively courteous, despite the frequency of angry, angry people they encounter.\n\nHowever, if you aren't in a hurry, and you aren't clinically depressed, this is a great people-watching Walmart!  By people-watching, I mean http://www.peopleofwalmart.com people.  If you are not one of them, you are in the minority at this store.\n\nI only shop here because I work nights and it is near my house, but with my attitude adjustment, it went from being hell on earth to fun times.  I do not recommend shopping here unless you have no other choice, because you will witness a wide variety of depressing and disconcerting behaviors from the customers.
2 ||| Dated, but nice.  Good Chicago hot dogs and they sell Old Style beer!  Can't beat that!
0 ||| It seems every casino must have a steak house and an Italian restaurant.\n\nContinuing the great Las Vegas tradition of uninventiveness and mediocrity, Marinelli's is the Italian eatery at the new M Resort. \n(By the way, the steak house is called Terzetto...which frankly sounds like another Italian restaurant to me.)\n\nIf last night's meal at Marinelli's is any indication, the M Resort is not much of a player in the intense competition for our gullets.\n\nTHE DECOR: Whoever designed the room should be sent to Guantanamo for unconscionable acts of aesthetic terrorism. It looks and feels like a buffet with too-small tables and a generically psychedelic carpet (all the better to hide the stains I guess). \n\nSpeaking of stains:  the bar at the front is odd. The counter was designed with a 4 inch slope on the outside edge. I guess cuz it looks nice. \nIt wasn't so nice, however,  when I watched a man put his glass of beer down, then a second later see it slide off and break on the floor.\n\nTHE FOOD: My steak was overcooked and had the consistency of a piece of choice-beef from Vons. My friend's Osso Bucco was cold and tasteless. My other friend didn't finish his risotto. \n\nI'm struggling to find something positive to say....hmmmm, let me think....Okay, okay I got it...the bread was pretty good. The rest of the experience was forgettable.\n\nTHE RESORT IN GENERAL: It's nice although it doesn't look like a billion dollars to me. It's rather Red Rockish in overall feel. \nThe bar upstairs at Veloce has a nice view...although they weren't equipped to make Absinthe in the proper way. \n\nMy favorite part of the complex was The Hostile Grape: a comfortable, stylish room with a very good selection of wines by the glass, including a Sine Qua Non that is almost NEVER available by the glass. Those of you who know wine, know what I mean.\nAlthough I must warn you, the SNQ is $49.50 an ounce.....or maybe I should say it's $49.50 an OUCH!\n\nI'm not a buffet guy but the buffet at M Resort looked interesting. The line-up was certainly long enough. \nIt's called Studio B and appears to combine the usual buffet experience with \"Show Kitchen\" entertainment where you see dishes being prepared. Perhaps I'll put a bag over my head and check it out one day.
2 ||| Flavor is there but the portions you get for the cost isn't proportionate. The large teriyaki chicken could feed 1 person full but wouldn't really be satisfying enough for two people. It's also a little strange to have such young children working the front desk. I mean that girl maybe was 13 and the boy maybe 9-10. Probably won't come back....
2 ||| It's a tourist destination, and sometimes the wait can be atrocious. So I mean you need to know that heading in. The Crispy Duck on noodles is freaking amazing, but for what it costs it should be a portion about 50% bigger. That's really my knock with LOS. The portions should be bigger given how much you're paying, or the food should just be perfect. That's where my 2 stars were lost.
0 ||| Well Yelp, you were right. I can't remember the last time I was at a place where the people there could care less if I spent my money or not. I walked in on a Monday 5PM and the cashier didnt say a word. I looked at one display case then walked to the other and she still didnt say a word. I finally asked what different kinds or cupcakes she had displayed and she said  vanilla, chocolate, and red velvet and went back to counting the drawer. I had some questions about quantities which she was fully annoyed at but mustered up the energy to respond. I then try to order and she says, \"Cash only, I already closed the register.\" I just walked out. Wow. Some people should stay in the back.
4 ||| I have never been to a show I didn't like!  Childsplay is the creme de la creme of children's theatre.  The actors are phenomenal and the bees knees at their craft.  Their costumes and sets hypnotize me and reel me in from the get go.  I love their Q&A sessions at the end of each play and the fact that they have a set of questions you can take home with you for the car ride back.  \n\nThey use literature for the majority of their plays and have new shows every single year.  \n\nBut what is even better is their traveling shows they send to schools around the valley and country.  If you are lucky enough to get a grant for them to come, you get shows that are just as good as those in the Tempe Performing Arts Center.  Their sets are smaller, but they have their amazing costumes, props, and music along with them.  They still do Q&A sessions after these traveling shows and give us teachers those same questions that they do at the TPAC shows.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if you are an adult without kids...everyone should attend at least one Childsplay show in their lifetime.  You are missing out if you don't!
4 ||| the service is excellent. the food is some of the best Mediterranean food I've had, particularly in Pittsburgh. the falafel salad is light and delicious and the pastistio is perfection.
1 ||| Ohhh I wanted to like it! We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said \"disgusting\". It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my \"disgusting\" game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like \u00be of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the \"natural\" fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.\n\nLike I said I wanted to like this place, I like the d\u00e9cor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style. I'll continue on my personal search for a great Las Vegas burger.
4 ||| Loved it!went there for late dinner with my husband on Monday night,it wasnt too busy,so we didn't have to wait for a table.service was great,our waitress was nice and very attentive.\nWe tried 5 different dishes:\n-dates wrapped in bacon!A must!im not a big fan of bacon,but it was so gooooood!i still can taste on my tongue\n-ceviche was okay,I felt it needs a bit more flavor\n-ahi poke with taro chips,it was good!big pieces of tuna,just loved it\n-lamb skewers was yummy too,my husband is a big fan of lamb,he knows when its good,he loved these one!\n-beef sliders was great as well,it was melting in my mouth!\nWe also got a pitcher of red wine sangria by recommendation our server,it was good,with apple pieces,has a nice flavor.but we couldn't even finish it!their pitchers are big!you have to share it with 3-4 ppl!\nLooking forward to come back and I will bring more people!
3 ||| We were just walking around starving and came across this place with a little line up out the door (this place is tiny so it looked real full). Lucky for us there was an empty table so we decided to try it out. \n\nWe got a beef burger, poutine and orangina. The service was pretty good considering there were only 2 people working (one cook and one cashier) and they still have to take care of approx about 5-6 small tables and a line up. They were incredibly effecient and no mistakes! The food was pretty good, well worth the money!  (which is not expensive at all)
0 ||| After moving to the north side of town, I had to find a new nail salon. This one was not only the closest one, but had decent reviews. I had to hesitation heading over. I needed a gel mani, but was looking forward to getting a pedi if time permitted (it did not). I spent an hour and a half at the salon, and my nails have never looked worse after a visit to a salon. \n\nWhen I walked in, I was immediately greeted and asked to pick out a gel nail color from their wall. There was a decent selection of colors in a few different brands, I was happy with them. Agreeing with another reviewer, the smell coming in was a little overwhelming, but I'm generally used to the smell of a busy nail salon. \n\nI told the gentleman doing my nails that I'd like the white french manicure in the gel polish and he immediately went to work removing the old gel from my fingernails. I was very happy with how he cleaned my nail beds, he was very precise in pushing and trimming my cuticles, I was surprised that he didn't ask if I liked my nails squared off (I do) but I was okay that they were a little rounded off. I told him I liked my white tips somewhat thick, and it wasn't until after he started polishing on the white tips that my experience went downhill. He layered on the white very thinly, I told him a total of 4 times that I like my white thicker. I told another manicurist, and she was able to tell him (apparently he didn't speak English). It took a final 10 minutes to dry my top coat (it only takes 2-3 at my old salon). In the end, my manicure came out lopsided, there were bubbles at the surface, and a small black speck in the gel on one of my nails. \n\nUpon checking out, the manager asked how things were and I told him that they weren't great, very sloppy. He told me to come back in a few days to re-do them. When I told him that I wasn't planning on coming back, he told me they could squeeze me in right then. Who has 3 hours to get a manicure?!\n\nPROS:\nNice front desk staff.\nDecent prices ($25 for a gel mani, $5 extra for french tips).\nMeticulous cuticle trimming.\n\nCONS:\nAcetone smell more prominent than most other salons.\nTakes longer than other salons (1.5 hours for a gel mani).\nUneven french tips, bubbles in my top coat, SLOPPY.\nSome manicurists don't speak English and will ignore your requests.\nWasn't ever asked what I prefer (round v square, thickness of french tip, etc.)\nWas never offered water (something I like about other salons.\n\nDefinitely will not be back, and wouldn't recommend to friends or family. :(
2 ||| A-Ok in my book. Nike SB's are getting harder to find (at least in Nike Outlet stores) but this Factory Store had one so I just had to get it. My current SB is dilapidated so I needed a new one.
1 ||| How frustrating!\n\nBest part of today's lunch was service - Anthony, originally from Astoria Queens NYC, has been here for 8 months, sounded exactly like he should sound with the NY accent, serving in an Italian restaurant!  He was helpful, attentive, interactive and one of the best servers I've had in this city.  He also brought a sample of the soup of the day to the table for tasting prior to ordering.  Very attentive service - bravo, Anthony!\n\nFood?  Very mixed reviews.  The tilapia special was thoroughly enjoyed by both diners at our table who ordered it.  Note to kitchen - the portion sizes on the two plates was noticably different (although the smaller portion did happen to go to the lighter eater so it wasn't a problem).  If the same dish is going to two people at the same table, they plates should look alike!\n\nI started with the minestrone soup (a menu staple) and while the flavor was good, it was tepid when served.  Made me sad.  My meatball sandwich was also a bit lukewarm and heavy on the salt.  It just didn't taste as fresh as I wanted.\n\nThis lunch was a birthday celebration so the lemon cookies with two dramatic candles was a very nice end to the meal.  And the cookies were great - not too sweet, enough lemon flavor without being bitter and enough to share around the table.\n\nNote on the door says that as of Feb 1, this will be a smoke free establishment.
0 ||| DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.. service was a joke.. waitress was flirting with people while taking my order. Worst oily  potstickers and thinest fish on a roll ever.. I spend $50 on 2 rolls and 2 nigiri .. never got a refill and never got wasabi and ginger when asked several times. Don't ever go!
1 ||| Saw owner wipe the tops of the red ketchup bottles with the same rag he used to clean the table. Won't go back.
0 ||| For it being a complete ghost town with no customers there the wait was absolutely horrendous, the one star is for the car wash
3 ||| I became acquainted with The Maine Lobster Lady food truck at the 2013 Las Vegas Foodie Fest.  After an announcement that only 20 Lobster Rolls were left, I sweated it out but remained in line, because I was about the 14th person from the window.  When I reached the ordering station the truck was already out of Blueberry Lemonade at 8:30 p.m. on the second day of the festival, but I was able to secure one of the last Lobster Rolls.  \n\nThe roll itself was rather small, and its contents were not warm like I thought they would be.  Instead this lobster Roll was refreshingly cold.  But it was chock-full of chunks of lobster graced by a light Lemon Mayonnaise Dressing.  Even the flippers tasted good!  I liked this cold roll despite my erroneous preconceptions of what it would be like.  It was served with a cold pickle spear, a small bag of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, and a wedge of lemon.  Priced at $18 a roll, there had better be some bang for the buck!  And there was!
2 ||| Walking in, I hadn't realized it was a chain, but it was a good place to relax a bit and grab a bite to eat.  \n\nI was feeling a bit under the weather, not up for a beer at the time, so I didn't sample any of their German style brews.  \n\nI did sample the house chips, which come topped like a loaded baked potato.  They weren't too shabby.  \n\nI also had the seared ahi salad.  It was good.  The greens were fresh and the tuna was perfect.  I also ordered a side of the sweet ginger rice.  (I can't pass up anything laced with ginger.)  It was also pretty good.\n\nThey serve dessert shooters which are great when you just want a couple of bites of something sweet.  It was a nice finale.
3 ||| My boyfriend and I stopped in here after looking for a place to grab dinner while out doing some other errands, and all I can say is I finally found a Thai place in Phoenix that I like.  The place was sort of empty, only a few other diners were present, but the seating was comfy and the atmosphere pleasant.  The menu is simple (only two pages) with a nice description of everything.  The food had awesome flavours and was spiced perfectly, and the green curry, yum!  I need to get more of that asap.  I also liked how the staff left you alone for the most part.  We were seated, given several minutes to look over the menu, placed our order, and once the food arrived we were given a decent amount of time to eat before being \"checked on\".  I'm sort of strange like that, both having worked in food service for years and having eaten out more than I probably should, I find myself one of the few people I know who actually likes to be left alone (for the most part) while eating.\n\nI definitely want to go there again, and soon!
0 ||| Service used to be good at REI but I have noticed it has deteriorated over that last decade (I am a member for 20+ years). It appears that they have many newbies without the experience of actually using the products. Some in customer service are just not knowledgeable enough. The other day I requested the store to hold an item for me, which they said was in stock. When I went there they did not have it and so they asked me to go to customer service and order it from a different store. The customer service lady took all me info including credit card and then told me that its a low probability you will get it from another store. But that she will call the other stores when she has the \"time\". WTF? I bought the item cheaper from Amazon.
4 ||| I happened upon this restaurant by accident. I stopped in for a tempura shrimp roll & ended up getting the ALL U CAN EAT. You can't beat this deal. The fish is so FRESH and the VARIETY was more than I ever expected. You have to go. The staff is friendly & very attentive. I personally sit @ the Sushi Bar as opposed to a table. Your Sushi Master is right there @ your service & they make the greatest suggestions. The one price covers everything except your beverage & it truly ALL U CAN EAT.\n\nIf you want great sushi and more for your money......YAMA SUSHI is the place to sit back & enjoy the menu.
2 ||| Only been once, had great service, but place was empty. We weren't informed about their happy hour, and saw that it was happy hour after we had already ordered a few things. Atmosphere was nice, Sushi was ok, about the same caliber as Tokyo Lobby or Yen Sushi, but I didnt order the Sashimi, so I cannot give any advice on that.. Probably gonna go here instead of the other 2 mainly because its closer to where we live.
0 ||| The worst service and customer service, hands down, I have ever experienced with any company, EVER. EVER. I set up a 3 bottle a month deal through costco for 18$/ mo. EVERY SINGLE scheduled delivery was missed, multiple times, EVERY SINGLE delivery was incorrect and required MULTIPLE phones calls and was never corrected. Charged for deliveries I didnt ask for, charged for all of the mistake they couldn't get right. NONE of my phone calls seemed to register, or be noted or recorded anywhere..EVER. In my first month of service I called the company 15 times. Finally, after realizing they were utterly incompetent, not to be trusted, and after i called to cancel, i was charged auto debited for what was to be the last month, i called back and requested my debit card be removed from their system. I said i didn't trust them to get the billing right. Smart deal - i get a $39 dollar bill in the mail for erroneous deliveries i never asked for, and asked them to pick up. Every single charge due to their own mistakes. Not only are the people working for this company incompetent, they are dishonest liars. No joke - it is easier to go to the store and buy 30 1 gallon jugs of water every month than deal with this crap. Not to mention, cheaper - gas included.
1 ||| Hmm... I read so many positive reviews on this place that I was really excited to try it. I got the pat's pounder platter with pulled pork, beef brisket, added on ribs for 3.99 and collord greens and hush puppies for around $23.00, kinda pricy, but I was hopeful on the quality.  Here is what I thought:\nPulled pork - really dry, and almost crunchy at times... definitely pass on this if I had to do it again\nBrisket  - pretty good actually, salty but good and flavorful \nRIBS - Never again! They were pretty much all bone, and so dry that I nearly broke a tooth! Given that this was a $4 add on to the plate I feel somewhat angry about it\nHush puppies - ok, nothing earth shattering \nGreens - really bland, although it didn't taste salty, kind of a shame, because a pound of salt may have actually improved the taste.
3 ||| Family working so no Thanksgiving dinner like everyone else and will get a meal this weekend. They aren't fans of the gobble so much either so I figured I should go get some turkey myself and cook what they would like for the feast. \n\nI saw somewhere that Shucks right next door to my house was having a traditional thanksgiving meal. \n\nFor $10.95 I got  a platter with 2 thick slices of turkey, mash potato, stuffing, green bean casserole, dinner roll, gravy and cranberry sauce. A pumpkin pie slice with whipped cream came with the meal. \n\nNow obviously nothing beats homemade, but for a restaurant and at that price it was pretty satisfying. The turkey wasn't dry, green bean casserole wasn't mushy and held a bit of bite making them the stand out components and to me- they're my favorite parts of a traditional meal so I was happy with it.  Everything else was standard, but solid.\n\nI walked home full and that's all I can really ask for.
1 ||| This review is for the Take Care Clinic more than the store itself.\n\na.  The waiting line - 2 star  - I really like the computerized check in system they have here. You can go on line or check in on their computer. It is totally cool, except that it takes a long time to check in. I am not sure if it saved my data from last time, I had to enter everything again. This thing is nice but very inefficient. \n\nb.  The Nurse Practitioner. 5 star - I thought this person was really good and explained everything. Helpful, caring and efficient.\n\nc.  Services offered - Saves you from having to pay high fees and long wait times at the other urgent care places. I think this is great.\n\nd.  Privacy - Limited. As they start talking to you in the main reception area, everyone waiting in this small modest area can hear you.  They end up taking you inside the room for more details, but the privacy is a bit sketchy in my book.\n\ne.  Charges - We are under 60 but got the shingle vaccine.  Cost is over 200.00 per person. This is standard as insurances will cover you after 60, but before it is on you.  I accept this but the system they have and how you check in does not let you know this in detail.  And, what is worse, the clinics billing is poor. I paid all my fees on Amex and still getting a bill to pay the fees from their central billing department. This bill is poorly done, not too much information and on the back there is no data on what to do if you dispute or anything like terms or conditions. \n\nI will come back again, as it is cheaper than urgent care, but this place is not too inviting as the experience is kind of blah.
0 ||| You just lost our business.. no longer open on Sundays is a very bad decision. Religion and business does not belong together.. seperate
1 ||| Not the greatest... Back to the basics!\nI was told the there was a steak/arugula salad as an option for dinner. I am not a fan of arugula, so I asked to have it on romaine (as they had a Caesar salad on the menu).  He asked the chef and the chef said no. I then said, can you just give me the Caesar salad and place a filet on it. He said sure. The entree came as follows... One plate with a filet (6oz) and one small bowl of Caesar salad. I asked what is this??? The server proceeded to tell me that the chef did not think a filet would go nicely on a Caesar. I told the server that I ordered the meal and not him. This really frustrates me. Cater to the customer, especially when this is a middle of the road restaurant. I also had (2) vodka and soda with a lime. The third one came with lemon. I asked why and where was my lemon. The server said that he did not want the drinks messed up? What?!? This place needs some flavor added to the meals, re-training of the staff and the chef to have a new attitude. I miss the First!!! The First was the restaurant prior.
3 ||| To modify a page from the Hooter's playbook, Ichabod's is \"Delightfully Creepy, Yet Refined.\"\n\nThe inside of the this place is creepy dark, almost to the point of tripping over furniture.  The small Tiffany-esque lamps on the tables and huge, heavy-looking furniture add to the quirky atmosphere.  To top it off they have someone playing a piano to a Casio-style beatbox!  It's a fun spectacle that must be experienced to be appreciated fully,\n\nI had the Neptune wrap for lunch today.  It was quite tasty.  The avocado was fresh and the French fries are coated with something that give them a little extra crunch.  I think the Strawberry Fields salad is on the agenda for my next visit.  I was offered a candied walnut from the salad by my lunch companion and it was sweet, but not disgustingly sugar crusty like your typical candied walnut.\n\nMy only real complaint is that they are used to working with a senior citizen clientele here, so service can be a little slow.  However, when we told our server that we were on a time crunch to get back to work on time today she was pleasant and incredibly helpful.  \n\nIchabod's is definitely on my list of favorites when work takes me to the east side.
4 ||| So I walked this bridge many times on my way back and fourth from the Pirates game. The Bridge is closed during Pirate games, but has a safe walking area even when cars are allowed on.  The bridge has beautiful views and on one end a guy selling $1 waters and Pirate Swag.
1 ||| The boba here is decent, depends on what you get. The food is horrible. Don't bother with the food menu.
3 ||| I took my girlfriend to Nostrano and we had a pretty good experience.  I had Whole Wheat Pasta With Lamb Ragu.  It was absolutely delicious.  My Girlfriend had red snapper with Clams and Mussels.  Another very good dish.  My only issue with Nostrano is the menu.  They have a very small menu.  So when you go there and they are out of certain dishes you might only have 3 things to choose from.  But overall, I would say give this place a try.
2 ||| Someone here does not care about his job. Now this is usually not true about the Bookman's employees I have encountered over the years.\n\nMaybe it is because he is old...or just had a bad day.  He did not even glance at all the trade I was bringing in...before flat out telling me no.\n\nAs I said..this is usually never a problem.  Yet I always visit the 19th ave location because it is closer.  So for a change of pace we sometimes visit this location.  I always seem to find something here....actually found 2 items I have been wanting.  But changed my mind on after the issue at the trade counter.
4 ||| *** Breakfast review ***\n\nSimple formula for the 5 star review here --- superb setting and a legendary huevos rancheros. \n\nAs someone said -- \"This is simply the best outdoor place to eat in Vegas....the decor is relaxing, fresh, pool side, green, so soothing!!\"\n\nIndeed. So relaxing, fresh, clean, quiet --- a stark contrast to the rest of Vegas.\n\nThe coffee was perfect and I am a picky coffee person. Service was good and not in your face at all. But the best part was the main.\n\nHuevos rancheros. A relatively straightforward dish. Made differently at a lot of places. But this sets the standard. The plate came out piping hot, the flavors mixed together so well, and the presentation was superb.\n\nLet me put it this way --- I eat out a LOT and am blessed to try some amazing places. I rarely have something I remember vividly later. The duck at the Modern in NYC, the cashew chicken at Ryutenmon Tokyo, the sushi at Kaygetsu here in in Menlo Park --- and now the huevos rancheros at Verandah Vegas. Well done guys, thank you for a great meal.
1 ||| Tortillas are always stale. Pizza is always either raw or burnt. On several occasions i have found that the staff had placed a new time label over another to avoid cooking fresh pizzas. \nThe quality of the food at this location just always seems to be sub par. I have lived near this location for ten+  years and its always been the same. So i go to the brown and mesa dr location
0 ||| Blek! Not only did the server take 15+ minutes to take our order, I had a crusty fork, and the salt shaker on our table had a dried noodle attached to it. I've had way better Asian food, and worked in Irvine, CA for ten years, so my standards are high, admittedly. My Ma Po Tofu tasted like it came out of a can. My friend's veggie Pho had bland soup base, and canned mushrooms, that's a killer for me right there.\n\nIf you want really good Pho, go to Tram's or Pho Mihn on Penn in Lawrenceville. For suburb sushi, try Chaya in Sq. Hill. And for good Korean, go to Sushi Kim's in the Strip.  In fact, I think any Asian place in Pittsburgh, would be better than going here. \n\nOr just save a few bucks, and get a package of Ramen at the grocery store and add an egg to it. Even that's better than the so called noodles at Lu Lu's!
1 ||| Stopped in here to watch a game on Sunday as this is a new bar for the area.\n\nThere is something wrong with their TV's. The picture is blurry.  Which is not uncommon in a dive bar.  What is uncommon is that I had not had a single beer yet and the picture was blurry.  I finished my beer and moved on down the road.
2 ||| Good chocolate croissants, even though they're shipped frozen and then baked at the premises.  \nDo they serve teas there?  I'll have to check that out next time I'm there for a croissant!
3 ||| Quality 24/7 food in vegas. Pit stop, fill up, drink up, back at the strip!\n\nIf you want good portion sizes, a meal thatll keep you full, and want to pass up on mickey Ds and Dennys, hit this place up.
1 ||| My fiancee and I ate here last night and the food was outstanding but the service was shite.  If you are not a celebrity or do not have a large party of spenders, the staff has little time for you.  There are not a lot of vegetarian options and the menu is written all in Italian, just fyi.
3 ||| I've been to Verona a few times now and always sing the praises of Michaels.  The burgers and hot dogs are just what you'd expect from a place like this and the custard is outstanding and there are plenty of flavors to choose from. My favorite is the caramel and cashew.  It is a nice place to stop by and just a short walk from my hotel.
2 ||| The last few times we have been here, we've sat upstairs at the bar.  Franco has always been our server so the last time we were there I asked him how long he had been working there - 35 years was the response.  Kudos Franco.\n\nWe have tried many items on the menu.  The food is mediocre, but satisfying and flavorful.  The lavosh is incredible.  Stay away from the cajun chicken quesadilla (very messy and only cheez and chix) and the buffalo wings scared me a bit (not a fan of pulling apart pieces of chicken).  I would recommend the veggie lavosh or the cajun lavosh.  We have had the fruit plate (LOTS of fruit - great for a hot summer day), and various sandwiches.  \n\nThe prices aren't too bad - the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  The other employees are generally friendly and helpful.  It's a great place for late night eats.
0 ||| This place is closed...\nNot sure why yelp hasn't updated the information yet...
3 ||| I dined here as part of a group recently.  Overall, we had an excellent experience.  First, with arrangements having been made beforehand (as you should with a group), they were most accommodating! The service simply couldn't have been any better for our group!  Ian, the Manager, personally made sure that everything was taken care of for us.\nThose in our group tried quite a variety of things from the menus.  So first, about the menu... they are very extensive and include dishes from several areas that geographically surround Malaysia.  They have everything from Japanese Sushi, to Indian curries, to multiple Chinese favorites.  They even have some Malaysian specialties on the menu too!  ; )  Some of the dishes that seemed to stand out for our group included the Malaysian Sea Bass and another Malaysian dish made with Stingray (or Skate).  I had the Curry Duck and thought it was quite good! I think that everyone in our group enjoyed the dishes they ordered, and that (for me) is quite a statement!\nThe location is great for dining before or after downtown activities or sporting events and there is adequate parking on both sides of the building.\nI don't have much to recommend for improvement, except that it may be time to organize the menus a bit.  There is more than one version and they differ.  But then, whatever you find on the one you have, will most likely be good anyway...
1 ||| The Houdini shops abound in Vegas which was both surprising and disappointing. The shops themselves are well kept and the staff at most of the locations I visited were entertaining and helpful to those I witnessed inquiring about tricks. However, I was disappointed with the narrow selections of mostly cheap plastic gimmicky novelty tricks specifically manufactured and branded for Houdini Magic sold at a premium price. Most are the quality and level you'd find in a kids magic set at any department store at Christmas time, so they are more toy than quality gimmick or trick. \n\nThe sales folks at every store try the hard sell on hovercard gimmicks and very cheap quality trick decks, but at least give the average Joe an entertaining exhibition to sell them on the product.\n\nDon't get me wrong, for the shops they are they are ok, but not at all what I would expect from a \"magic\" store in the magic capital of the US. I was a little surprised to find Vegas only has Houdini shops and nothing more robust or at least with a varied selection.\n\nIf your looking for fun gimmicks for younger folks or stuff to entertain coworkers a few times, it's at least worth a stop, but don't plan to find anything worthwhile if you've ever dabbled in magic before. Your kids will probably enjoy the experience, but you'll most likely be disappointed.
4 ||| Copper Blues is a cool place to some and listen to some music or hear some comedy.   My husband and I have been to Copper Blues a couple of times now.  The staff is really great and the food is great too.   Also they have a huge selection of beer on top that you can choice from.  If you are ever in town for a business trip or on vacation you should check out Copper Blues in downtown Phoenix.  Thanks Copper Blues for being a great restaurant and pub.
3 ||| It was a good lunch.  I had, by recommendation the carne asada quesadilla, a taco and the chips and salsa.  It was all good, my favorite was the salsa.  The space is your becoming more and more typical, renovated home.  The lunch line was short and it moved fast, I'll be sure to visit again soon.
0 ||| This place had horrible service. Waited over a hour for my food and it came out cold. Never even got my check to leave....if there was a negative star option this place would have it.
4 ||| Delicious yogurt that was better than Yogurtland. Great flavors. It's been a long time since chocolate froyo has been done right. Loved the Honeydew. Pecan pie was great! Ill be back!
2 ||| Really nice venue, with a great huge bar. Having been to the original in midtown NYC this is nothing like it. The food isn't quite as good as NYC, but it's still decent for sure. We tried a slew of share-able foods. The service was excellent at the bar and at our table. The waitresses are all hotties, which is never a bad thing.\n\nFood reviews from best to worst:\n\nKobe rice balls were by far the best thing we tasted, we ordered a second plate of them they were so good.\n\nKobe Meatball is excellent and huge, great meat texture.\n\nBurrata salad was a special and was done nicely, but not as great as other spots nearby (such as B&B). \n\nEggplant parm was decent, not enough sauce, and too heavy/oily.\n\nSkipped Scallops and the calamari, since I'm allergic.
4 ||| I had my daughters baby shower here. Let me tell you I was a pain with all my changes. The banquet manager, Nova was very helpful and patient. At the event the room was beautiful, service great and the food was really good. I did not have one complaint!
2 ||| Pizza delivery fella was really nice. \nOrdering was super easy. I was in a house full of littles that were loud so doing it online was handy. \nThe pizza was ok. I've had better, but I've had worse.\nI had the bbq chicken. I liked the caramelized onions on it. Pepperoni pizza was ok.
3 ||| Who knew that Papago Brewing was hiding in the Papago Plaza just a couple of miles from where i live?  Not me!  \n\nI met my new friend Brian M at Papago Brewing Company for a beer yesterday (Friday) around 5pm.  He was sitting at the bar waiting for me when I walked in... and just as I sat down next to him, Jess (the friendly bartender) came over to see what I was drinking.  I told her what I liked, and she brought me a cool tall glass of Orange Blossom, a light American Wheat Ale flavored with Mandarin Orange and Vanilla.  They compare it to a liquid old fashioned creamsicle.  It hit the spot and believe it or not, it gave me a nice buzz too!  Yes, I am a light weight!\n\nJess also brought over a sample of a black cherry beer that I cannot for the life of me remember the name of.  It was sweet and delicious.\n\nI'm not a huge beer drinker, but after seeing Beer Wars and now seeing the variety of craft beers that Papago has to offer, I may become one soon.  Well - maybe I should wait until after the wedding - a beer bellied bride probably wouldn't be so cute?!\n\nThe beer selection for take out is awesome too - next time I need to bring beer somewhere, I'll head to Papago for sure!  If you're looking for a comfortable place to go have a beer, head to Papago... tell Jess I say hello!
2 ||| Not my favorite Las Vegas steak experience.\n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and waited 15 minutes for our table.  It took our waitress another few minutes to arrive, give us menus, etc.  She seemed disinterested the entire time and rarely checked in on us.  We had to ask for refills on our water, alcohol, etc.\n\nThe duck fat fries were amazing, as were their accompanying sauces.  Michael Mina, and his obsession with threes, did well with the three types of fries and sauces.\n\nThe steak wasn't amazing.  It pains me to type that.  I expected to bite into that steak and be like \"mmmmmmmmm\" but it was more like \"mmm.\"\n\nThe sides I tried were excellent - the truffle mac and cheese was outstanding and the flavors and textures of the creamed spinach made my mouth happy.\n\nThe bathrooms were filthy.\n\nWith so many amazing steak places in Vegas, I expected more here.  Ah well.
0 ||| Don't bother! We were greeted by some blonde hostess girl who was being EXTRA rude to everyone who had a question....we asked how long the wait was and they said  it was a 30 to 40 mins but we were on our way out of Vegas so we went to the To Go side....... All 4 of us ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was literally the size of a McDonald's hamburger it came with cheese and bacon no condiments not lettuce or tomatoes with fries an extra large soda for $16 each!!! We could have gone to In n out and spent that much on 2 meals I wanted rootbeer as my drink so They had to give me a small because the rootbeer is more expensive?????. \nThe banana split my friend ordered was not spectacular I could have made a better one at home plus it wouldn't cost nearly as much.
0 ||| This place is horrible! \n\nThe personnel are obnoxious and incompetent teenagers. The service will make you think it can't be real and that it must be a practical joke. The pizza is bad. The so called dining room is tiny and filled with little tables and cruelly uncomfortable metal chairs that have no cushioning. How does a place like this stay in business?
4 ||| Super bonne place pour d\u00e9guster des cocktails entre amis, y'a vraiment beaucoup de choix d'alcool et pas commun.\n\nL'endroit id\u00e9al pour des soir\u00e9es de gens de labo!
3 ||| Re: Grooming Salon. Specifically, Katie, the cat handler.\n\nIt is near to impossible to find cat groomers in this town. Some vets offer the service but after today's visit to Petsmart I won't go anywhere else. So the deal is I have a demon cat. Well, she's lovely and adorable with me, but for some reason fears all pet workers. No clue why, nothing bad has ever happened to her. \n\nKatie works Tuesday through Friday and starts at 7am, which I can appreciate because no one else should have to witness the dramatics my cat puts on. I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)  Katie got an E-collar on Josie and told me she was going to have to scruff her while she worked, which was just fine with me because the cat was screaming like a murder victim and otherwise being embarrassing. In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened. \n\nLook, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane. Maybe Katie considers what she does completely normal and reasonable, but she's the first professional who has worked with Josie...professionally. \n\nI know my cat is a total freak but I can't shave her ass myself, so thank god Katie is at Petsmart. Seriously.
1 ||| Cannot recommend before safety standards are improved. \n\nPros: courteous, professional shuttle drivers who are punctual; office was helpful in rescheduling due to my delayed flight\n\nCons: Loose safety procedures. My single seat buggy lacked left foot rest, four point belt was checked only after I asked. Was not told which group to follow, turned out I was w the guide and two company mechanics, yet I was constantly left in the dust due to my groups familiarity and my sub standard buggy w reduced power. Trying hard to keep up, my buggy gave up half way up a slope the others cleared. I was told that some buggies were beat up so didn't perform well. Not one buggy had a raised flag; this combined w a group that weaved in and out, I lost the group often in the dunes. We were told to follow the guides path bc wavering just 10 ft could result in serious injury: on two occasions I lost the group and hit violent falls. Finally, when it's time to park, one of the staffs buggy rear ends mine, causing a not insignificant whiplash. All I heard was another staff jeer \"what the f r u doing?\" followed by more banter among the staff. No apologies, as if rude behavior explained the \"it's all in good fun\" attitude towards this potentially dangerous sport. \n\nI've done experience events w skip barber and Infineon raceway; all very professionally run and ran strict safety procedures. Sun Buggy feels run by frat brothers who believe the periodical \"r u having fun dude\" is equal to safe and fun.
1 ||| Talk about bait and switch. Ads said prime rib dinner $9.99, steak and lobster dinner $11.99, steak and sea food dinner $13.99, etc. So we show up ask for the prime rib dinner, no prime rib dinner here, it's at the buffet... Strike one.  Ok steak and lobster dinner $11.99 ... It's not available until 8pm. Strike two.  Ok, steak and sea food dinner $13.99 ...  We'll that's part of the early bird special.. It's 6 pm - strike three -your out!  No early bird, no late bird, no prime rib. We end up having the queen cut prime rib and the chef's special, orange roughy. This included a soup/salad and bread.  Overall the prime rib was ok a bit over cooked. The roughy was good, although the orange flavor was a bit much after awhile. Bottom line: food was ok but the price was a bit much for what we received. Hoping for the special and getting an overprice meal doesn't give you a good taste in the overall experience.
3 ||| This is probably one of the best sushi places I've been to in Vegas that is off the strip.\n\nThere were no lines, it was not busy so the servers were very attentive & the service was great. Since this was my first time there, the server kindly explained to me their specials and their recommended dishes. \n\nThe quality of the sushi was really good. The cut of the fish was not thin and not small like the other restaurants that I've been to...And best of all they do 1/2 off nigiris & rolls. So you get your monies worth for sure!!\n\nI ordered the tiger roll and these usually cost $10-15 depending on the restaurant; the original price here was $10 but since it was half off, I got it for $5 and it was a FULL roll; with 8 pieces. \nI also ordered the amaebi (sweet shrimp) and I'm very picky about this nigiri. But this sushi was amazing. Two large shrimps and it was delicious!\nMy friend ordered a few orders of salmon & hamachi. Both were great, nice & fatty.\n\nThis will be my new go-to sushi place in Vegas!
3 ||| The decor and views cannot be surpassed.  Couches are a bit uncomfortable - too deep and too many pillows, but we made do.   Ordered an appletini, of course.... even explained how I wanted it made and what I got was a \"sweet & sour\" tini.  UGH.  It was really late and I didn't have the energy to send it back.  So we enjoyed our time in the bar and then went to bed - which was right down the hall!  :)
1 ||| I've NEVER seen a hotel room without a dresser! We're here in Vegas for 5 days, so obviously our two suitcases have a few clothes. Unfortunately, when they added the flat screen TV, on the wall (nice), they took away the TV/dresser. This is a handicap accessible room, and there is NO place to put away clothes. There wasn't even a table like in the room two doors down. So one suitcase is on the luggage rack, and the other one is on the safe. I guess now I'll have to check if a hotel room has a dresser. The only redeeming grace is that it's only costing us around $36 avg a night.
4 ||| Today is a sad day. My partner and I went to Maui Dog for the ALWAYS good dogs and fries. They were already closed. This was one of my top 5 meals in Phoenix. Consistently excellent. We will miss you very much. I hope that you find a new home in central Phoenix! Say, Melrose District?
4 ||| Great service and great food.  We had salmon and peel and eat shrimp and both were wonderful.  The service was quick and friendly with great attention to our needs.  Our first trip here but not our last
4 ||| Simply the best steak sandwich in pittsburgh! The meat is amazing and the staff friendly and helpful. The gentleman working the counter even offered to come around to explain all the chef's homemade sauces to us. I will be back again and again!
2 ||| I thought Suede was alright.\nWhen we arrived at 10:30, it was pretty sparse...that's mainly why we went here first. The drinks weren't too expensive, and the bar service was really friendly.\nI loved the atmosphere...this place would be really great to take a date. There are little sitting areas off in the corner, and also high tables throughout the space where you can stand and put your drink down and chat. The dancing pole in the corner was fun...I didn't try it but some girls did, and it added a fun and sexy mood to the place. There was red lighting, and it wasn't pitch black, which was nice. \nThe only reason why my friends and I left, was because it was a serious Sausage Fest. We actually wondered if it was a Gay night at Suede. The ratio of men to women was 20:1. \nAlso, the DJ was playing music a little too loud for a bar. My friend and I were screaming over the music. \nThe outside patio is nice, and its sort of romantic as well.\n\nBring your date here, but otherwise, Suede is just okay.
3 ||| I go to this market just about every week during on-season. They are the best market in the Madison area. Large enough to have a great variety of things, pretty much everything you'd expect at a market, and small enough that it can be a quick trip instead of an hour-long venture just to find what you want. They always have some sort of performer doing music, which ranges from \"not my taste\" to wonderful. Shout-outs to Noel's Jams & Jellies, for having the best homemade jams, jellies, pickles, sauerkraut & more that I've ever had. You really can't go wrong. Also, Cafe Social has some great iced beverages. Also, Farmer John has the best cheese curds in WI, as far as I'm concerned.
1 ||| I only went here because my normal breakfast spots were really busy. Found the staff fairly rude and not very helpful. The food was overpriced for what it was. Coffee was bad restaurant coffee (brown water). There are much better breakfast options in town. I will likely not eat here again.
0 ||| Where do I start? I recently moved into the neighborhood  and was extremely excited when I noticed this place. I love a quick healthy option and this seemed perfect. Well, far from it. One evening I decided to try it out, checked their hours on the website to be sure they were open it was 8:30p and their site stated they closed at 9:00p. Awesome. When I got there 10 minutes later I walked in to the chairs being stacked up and food being put away. I kindly asked if they were still open to which the 6 employees standing around responded in unison looking around at each other, \"uuuuhhhhhh, uuuummmmm....kinda.\"  So I'm standing at the door like an idiot waiting for someone to say \"of course, we're open until 9:00p, how can I help you?!\" But no, I had to make the first move to say  \"well, sorry to bother you I guess I'll try this some other time\" .  They said bye, GIGGLED, and continued closing up shop early. \n\nMy second attempt was unfortunately forced upon me this afternoon. I'm a medical sales rep and cater several lunches per week and had a request for gluten free meals. Grabba Green came to mind so I placed a phone order. After providing my CC info I made a split second decision to ask for all sauces on the side. The employee became quickly and noticeably exasperated, literally sighing and speaking a million miles a minute telling me she now had to hurry and go tell the cooks that sauce was on the side, to which I APOLOGIZED, just before she hung up on me. I showed up, practically bagged my own food, and left.\n\nIf service was better I could see myself using them a couple times a week to cater these lunches (which typically range from 15-50 people and at about $10/meal that would be a nice bit of business for one order). I don't care how great/healthy their food is, the service is horrible and their employees are incredibly rude. If I were the owners I would be livid at the way these kids are representing my business.
4 ||| Amazing Mexican restaurant! Amazing food, amazing service, amazing drink just WOW! So glad i discovered this gem. There dips are great, i had the enchilladas and there mojitos are great to beat the Vegas heat.\nWill definately go back next time i am in Vegas.
2 ||| A very swanky place, they have red carpet at the door way!!\n\nAs it was the last week to have my dad in town, we decided to try this always-have-fancy-cars (Aston Martin, anyone?) parked outside steakhouse. It was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night, we both felt the restaurant is too dark and too loud!\n\nFood was delicious! Medium rare filet was juicy and nicely cooked, the steamed asparagus on the side was very fresh, and the Alaskan king crab legs, wow, a lot of them and very salty!\n\nWhile we enjoyed the food, served with excellent service, we just felt like it was missing something, but can't really describe to detail. Personally, I just didn't really get the outside to be all so fancy swanky, but no peace to be found anywhere inside, and what's up with the metal-ish decor?\n\nI will just say, yeah, I tried, for a better quality of food and price, I would much prefer J&G.
3 ||| Its one of the larger more traditional big city type malls in Vegas. Lots of department stores and tons of stores. Nothing too fantastic but it is worth checking out if you are looking for the normal shopping in Vegas.
1 ||| Ehhh. It's going to be difficult to write this post because I really like watching Gordon Ramsay's cooking shows and programs, but I have definitely had better burgers. Don't burn me at the stake for this review.\n\nLocated in Planet Hollywood at the front entrance is a small modern bar-like area where my bf and I both got in line to try out the place. A bit of a wait, but I figured it's Gordon Ramsay, everyone wants to eat here. We were seated and we had our order ready to go (there is an interactive menu while you are waiting in line which is pretty cool) and I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my bf got the burger with lamb. We also ordered some truffle parmesan fries to share. The wait took awhile for the burgers to come out and our waitress came by and gave us an ipad to order some drinks during our wait. I can see the technological interactive appeal of the place, but it didn't say anything about the food. \n\nMy burger came out and it tasted okay, but the most disappointing part of the meal was that the burger was lukewarm to cold. Wondering if my senses were off, I asked my bf to try a piece of it to see if it was cold, and he confirmed that the burger was pretty cold. It tasted like the burger had been sitting out for awhile or only partially cooked. He asked me if I wanted to let the waitress know, but I tried eating a few more pieces to see if it that was really how they wanted the burger made. Afterwards, I just left the burger by itself and munched on some truffle fries. The truffle fries were okay (they were hot at least) but a little bit overpowering on the truffle oil.\n\nMy bf wasn't that impressed with his burger either. He said that mine tasted better than his, but too bad that the temperature was off. We waited for the waitress to clear our table and I mentioned that my burger was pretty cold. She said that she was sorry but I could tell that there was little that she could do with the situation. \n\nWe paid our bill (a hefty $54 something) and tipped. I kept thinking in my head that I have had a better burger in a place like Red Robin. Sorry Gordon, but I'm sticking to your cooking shows. I don't think I'll be back here.
4 ||| I was looking for a place with free wi fi and went to Tea Station yesterday but the wi fi wasn't working. I found this place via Yelp just a mile or so away. Boy, am I glad I did!\n\nThe restaurant is clean and spacious, has free wi fi, two flat screen tvs, and a comfortable vibe. The staff is very nice, doesn't rush you and push suggestions on you. If you're like me and needed to finish your taxes or work they give you all the space and time you need without making you feel like you've overstayed your welcome.\n\nOf course, the food is good also. They're known for their stinky tofu, which I didn't order but smelled authentic. I ordered a milk tea with boba which was perfect. I also tried their Fu Chou fishball soup which was delicious and unique. To finish, two of us shared the shaved ice plate which was plenty for two.\n\nI'd give this place 4.5 stars but since there's no such thing I'm rounding up.\n\nBottom line, better value and environment than Tea Station. We'll be back!
1 ||| Maybe I went on an off day but I was not happy with my sub. I think I ordered an Italian Sub. What I got was a soggy sub which I didn't even finish half of it. I have heard people rave about this place but I don't see it.\n\nIf you are in Chandler and you are craving a deli sandwich just go to Jason's Deli. I'm not saying they are great (almost no sandwich shops are) but that's your best bet unless you really want to feel like you could have made your meal at home, which happens at Jason's Deli too...
3 ||| Where have you been all my life, Ichiza?\n\nSushi, Ramen, and anything else Japanese? In one little space? \n\nI was intimidated by the wait at first, but what started as an hour wait ended up being only 25 minutes when several other parties cancelled. And thankfully, this appears to happen A LOT. But just remember, while it's not required, reservations do come highly suggested.\n\nAs a party of four, we all went in on the menu! One friend got sushi, another got mackerel, I got Japanese-style chow mein and gyoza and the fourth friend got something that begins with \"oppa\" (not sure how it's spelled). It's all perfect for sharing. I liked everything except the mackerel (and I don't like mackerel in the first place so the restaurant is at no fault for that).\n\nEverything on the menu is really cheap by itself, but be mindful that everything does add up really quickly. We were quite surprised by our bill at the end of the meal.\n\nOh and did I mention I loved the ambiance? Between the low tables, the backless chairs, the small space with warehouse lighting, the large crowds and the Japanese written all over the walls, I really did feel like I had just been transported to Tokyo, and not just an Asian-themed strip mall in Las Vegas.\n\nPros:\nThe ambiance\nMenu has loads of variety and very reasonable prices\nFrequent and friendly service who won't get annoyed if you add more and more to your plate\n\nCons:\nSmall space leading to (possible) long waiting times to be seated and served\nWhile each individual item is inexpensive, it can all add up really quickly if you're not paying attention\n\nReturn Factor: I'd love to
1 ||| Nothing overly bad about it.  It's your standard Peter Piper.  I think my problem was more with the clientele than the employees or the facility.  I was born and raised in the barrio, but come on......kids were acting like their parents weren't even there.  When your kids are over ten, you need to let them know that Peter Piper and Chuck E Cheese aren't really for you anymore.  These kids were ten and twelve acting like they were five.  My grandma would have smacked em.  My parents would not have taken us there in the first place.  If it were just for the food and employees, it would be a three.  The customers make it a 2.  Rude!
0 ||| As a Lux devotee, it took me a long time to check this place out, but I went in with an open mind.\n\nMy drink was so bad (iced soy latte) that I'm going to be real generous here and assume that Something Was Amiss or the barista was new or something.  I ended up having to toss it.  How did they mess up something so basic?  HOW.\n\nThe girl at the register was not friendly.  At all.  The wait for the drink seemed absurdly long considering I was the only person there (again with the new barista theory).  I expected a lot more from the interior.  It was all right, quite airy, but basically bland and boring.\n\nMicroscopically cheaper than Lux, but I regret wasting my money there and won't be back.
3 ||| Taking price into consideration, the food here is nothing exceptional...greasy French bistro stuff. But the view from the patio is exceptional for people-watching! It faces right out onto the Vegas Strip, so you'll get an eyeful of the wacky passers-by and street freaks, with the occasional spouting of the Bellagio fountains across the street to liven things up.\n\nIf there are no seats available on the patio, however...no dice. The food isn't worth coming here without the view.
2 ||| Mixed....success depends on your agenda for that day.  Busy, popping, happening and great band - scores high.  Other scores average.  Went there last night (Sat) with two girlfriends (6:30pm).  Sound system was so loud we couldn't talk to each other and couldn't really have a good discussion with waitress re recommendations.  Shared antipassi.  Had we understood more about how blockbuster good it is we would have selected all the options and just had that.  I asked the waitress to recommend Shrimp salad vs tuna salad and was shocked when she said shrimp because if tuna salad is served seared normally kicks shrimp's ass.  Two of us ordered it and were terribly disappointed.  I agree with another yelper it was a tiny fried popcorn shrimp salad.  I also agree with another yelper - the place is inconsistent.  They need some mystery diners to fine tune their offering.  All that being said I will go again with another group of people and have a totally different experience because we will choose to sit at the bar and drink, snack on the antipassi and listen to music.
0 ||| I in general really like Samurai Sam's restaurants for their healthy meals. This location is, however, terrible. Wait time is really long - often 30 min instead of promised 10, once in a while screwed up orders. But I would still come there occasionally after my work outs at LVAC. This time, however, made me really pissed off. I'm not ever going back to this location (unless management and staff will be changed!). I've ordered 4 different teriyaki bowls for my family to go. Not only I had to wait for over 30 min (kitchen staff worked so slow, no multitasking whatsoever!), when I got home I've discovered that they've screwed up all 4 bowls. I immediately called them, but instead of a apology and acknowledging it, lady servicing me (\"Emmy P.\") was rude and said that they can't do anything about it. I had to dump 2 of the bowls, as my kids refused eating it not the way was ordered :(((( Very disappointed.
0 ||| Agree 100% with every review here.  This is exactly why so many Americans despise union labor! \n\nEXTORTION is defined as \"the crime of obtaining money or some other thing of value by the abuse of one's office or authority\".  This couldn't be a more fitting term for this company.  You are absolutely forced to use their useless services that barely anyone needs, and be charged completely egregious amounts! \n\nMy colleagues and I attended an event where packing up our materials took all of about 6 minutes, yet they still charged us for their \"union labor\" of about $400.  Ok so lets break this down - even if they did do the work themselves, is packing 2 boxes in 6 minutes really worth that much???  How can anyone logically justify such an insane amount? \n\nThey are completely disorganized, rude and absolutely greedy - couple that with flat out lazieness and you get the equation for everything that is wrong in America! \n\nRide the wave while you can GES...get completely overpaid and take multiple 1 hour breaks throughout a single day, all without doing any real work -  the ways of your world are dying out as the government slowly dismantles your corrupt, useless and archaic system...then you'll actually have to work in a world filled with competition where your pay is actually based on PERFORMANCE (gasp!).
1 ||| Total regret.  That bad expired fish tossed and turned in my stomach and I spent the whole flight in the bathroom.  They destroy even avocado and cucumber rolls.  \n\nThanks very much for cutting back on your staff and not keeping your fish fresh Hissho!  Next time I pass through i'm going to make the manager eat the crap they put on the shelves.
2 ||| I was a loyal Sakana fan for years up until the birth of my sone.  Going out for sushi is not so convenient with a lil one. So after a 3 year hiatus, my husband and I opted for Sakana on date night.  Would it be all that we remembered? Disappointed to say that it wasn't. We sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were not as personable as they were in the past - very little banter or recommendations. The saving grace was the scallop dynamite - the best I have had in the Valley and the oranges for dessert. Gosh how I missed those.  \nI accept that maybe a 3 year break might have built up my expectations.
2 ||| As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \"OK\"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.
2 ||| food/service was ok. nothing special imo. i had a chicken sandwhich with hot sauce.\nid like to of had a beer with my lunch but they only had rootbeer.\nand the place did smell a little odd, kind of like a bathroom maybe it was the cleaning products?? it would be a lot nicer if they served beer and had the place smelling like the food theyre cooking.\nalthough this nellis location is closer, i liked the older location better.
2 ||| Tried my first poutine! Exactly what it says fries, gravy and bland little cheese balls. I think the rendition was good but the sentimental taste is better than it actually is.  Burger was average but on a nice roll. Street watching priceless!
1 ||| The service at this location was HORRENDOUS.\n\nWas not informed that soda is not included with the meal but milk, tea and coffee are.  So my son ordered a soda which was like $2.50 extra when he would have been happy with the free iced tea.\n\nThe salads came out with almost no dressing on them.  When I asked for more we were charged $.75 per salad for more.\n\nOrdered a kids meal for my 6 year old.  Was brought out a regular sized meal.  When I asked the waitress informed me it was an adult portion.  When I said I wanted a kid meal she took the adult meal back and made us wait about 5 minutes for the kid portion to come back.\n\nHad to ask for drink refills.\n\nWaited forever for the bill and even longer for her to pick the bill up.
4 ||| Seriously? More than a 100 reviews, and an average 5 star rating on Yelp? It's certainly rare to find a restaurant with 5 stars after this number of reviews.  I had to try it to believe it.\n\nFood (9.5/10) = Simply incredible.  The first time I visited Gaucho, I went with the most frequently mentioned Yelp item - the carne (steak) sandwich.  This sandwich is HUGE!  Generous portions of a cut of your choice.  I go for the ribeye, which is a great choice for flavor.  Other components of the sandwich include roasted red bell peppers, onions, chimmi churri sauce.  The bread just absorbs all the juices from the meat and roasted peppers, not letting any flavor go to waste.\n\nIf a sandwich is not your thing, there's certainly a variety of other proteins for your choosing, both from the land and sea.  I was surprised and impressed with how absolutely delicious Gaucho's camarones (shrimp) were.  I'm always weary of ordering seafood if I'm not near the coast line, with the concern for freshness.  But goddamn, these shrimps were hella succulent.  Sooo succulent.\n\nOther worthy proteins include the chorizo, chicken, and flank steak.\n\nIf you're in the mood for some vegetables, Gaucho's grilled corn, and their mix of asparagus, portabello, onions, peppers, zuchinni, are also great choices.\n\nIf you still need more flavor, there are 4 sauces to help enhance the experience:   1) chimmi churri (fresh herbs, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, vinegars), 2) pimenton (charred pepper, garlic, fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil), 3) ajo (roasted garlic, fresh herbs & extra virgin olive oil), 4) cebolla (carmelized onion, rosemary, thyme, vinegars & extra virgin olive oil)\n\nService (10/10) = Family owned business are always great.  The two brothers running this joint never fail in making you feel welcome, and are full of energy and enthusiasm for the food they prepare.\n\nAmbiance (8.0/10) = The place is small and cozy, and unfortunately there are only a handful of stools for people to sit on, as they enjoy the greatness of Gaucho.\n\nOverall Opinion = Incredible food.  Awesome service.  What more could you possibly want?  Well, my only annoyance with this place are their business hours and the very limited number of seats for people to chill out and enjoy their food.  I heard they are about to expand, so this will solve the latter issue.  Their business hours were a major influence on why it took me more than half a year after moving to Pittsburgh to finally visit this place.  It would be great if they opened until at least 8 or 9 pm.  It would also be great if they opened on Sundays.  Nevertheless, their business is thriving, and certainly not short on customers.  Like I said in the beginning of this review, Gaucho had an average of 5 stars after 100 reviews.  I now understand why.  It is TRUTH!  Now make your pilgrimage to this fine establishment in the Strip District.
0 ||| I had quite an awful experience with Suzie's Mama Bear several years back.  It's been a while since it happened (about 7 years ago), but I definitely believe it is a cautionary experience worth sharing. \n\nI am now severnteen, but a while back ago, I used to be enrolled in Suzie's Mama Bear after school. It was just about the worst daycare experience I could describe for a child, but given my age, I was not able to articulate it to anyone. \n\nThe daycare, as I remember it, was a wild mess. Children were swearing all over, and none of the adults there would do anything about it. I had a dietary restriction to where I could not have milk, so my mother personally instructed them not to give me regular milk and brought them the milk substitute I should have drank for during snack time. The lady in charge never even bothered to use it, so I was unknowingly drinking regular milk each day without knowing it and having my health harmed.\n\nOne day, I was pushed by one of the older kids who was at the daycare, as bullying was quite normal there. I fell on my arm the wrong way and broke my wrist in multiple areas. I had to repeatedly ask the adult there to call my mom over the course of an hour before she actually instructed someone to make the phone call. Then, I had to wait about an hour and a half for the staff to actually call my mother because they seemed to view it as low-priority, thinking I may have just hurt myself. By the time I had arrived at the emergency room, it had been over three hours since I broke my wrist. \n\nSince then, I don't know what sort of changes have been made with the daycare, but I wanted to share my perspective. I definitely do not think this is a place anyone should be taking their children.
1 ||| We read so many good reviews on Yelp that we had to try this place. We took the light rail and arrived around 830pm Saturday night. \n\nThe place looked very promising with its modern indoor/outdoor blended setup. It was a full house but not too packed. We waited around 20 minutes for a table which was passed with a round of drinks from the bar. This is where the downhill slide began. A Plum Blossom was ordered from the cocktail menu. It was so sugary, it really was totally undrinkable. The two Kiltlifters ordered came with about an inch and a half to spare to the top, as if someone took some sips on the way from the bar. The glass of house white was barely acceptable. \n\nDuring our wait we had time to study the menu and decided the pumpkin soup and pepper crusted flat iron steaks would be ordered by at least two in our party. Little did we know until seated that they were out of the flat iron steak which left very limited options. \n\nWith pumpkin soup on the way along with a burger, the roasted chicken, and a flatbread, we still had high hopes. \n\nThe pumpkin soup was brought quickly. The plate was burning hot and the soup ice cold with a hardened film covering the top. We would have sent it back but our entrees arrived so soon after there  wasn't time. Apparently they pre-pour and use heat lamps. \n\nThe flat bread was just so so...very dry. The chicken was nothing to write home about. The burger was super well done (ordered medium well) and very dry. The menu states that it comes with a choice of sides but when we asked our waitress she stated that it only comes with fries. \n\nA bottle of Patz&Hall Pinot Noir was ordered for the table. Normally we love Pinot's but this one was awful. It was much too harsh. \n\nBy the end of the meal we had had enough. Dessert was offered but we politely passed. \n\nMaybe we are the sole recipients of a bad meal as the star ratings on here are very high. But in our opinion, Postino's and Maizes have nothing to worry about if this is the best St. Francis can offer. \n\nOn the plus side, there was a very entertaining crowd. The women's  bathroom was occupied by a frolicking couple so all in our party had the opportunity to digest the provocative corral art in the men's room. \n\nNormally this place would deserve nothing better than a single star but it gets two as the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was worth something.
2 ||| Actual rating 3.5 stars.\n\nThis was the second of three lunch dates that the No1DP and I had over the course of our last Vegas stay. \n\nZine Noodles Dim Sum is located inside the Palazzo casino floor. This was rather convenient as we didn't have to get out of the Venetian/Palazzo hotel complex, but as with all Palazzo restaurants a bit of a walk to get to from Sands Expo, the site of many a convention. It also didn't help he only had a little more than an hour for lunch.\n\nService was really slow that day, even if only half the restaurant was full. It took 30 minutes from when the orders were placed to the appetizer being served. No1DP was a little late to his next class because of this.\n\nAppetizer: Steamed Shrimp Har Gow. $6.95 gets you 4 pieces. The har gow was relatively big compared to other dim sum places and the wrapping was not too thick. The har gow was even better when I dipped it in the chili sauce.\n\nMains - When the main dishes came we were rather surprised how big our dishes were. Each dish could feed at least 2 people. This was my first meal of the day (dunno how much No1DP ate beforehand) but the No1DP and I were only able to finish half our dishes. Note to self: next time get extra plates for sharing because it seems like these dishes were made to be served a la carte and not in individual portions. \n\nNo1DP had the braised E-Fu noodle with crab meat ($18.80). E-fu noodles are used in Cantonese yee mein. In normal preparation these egg noodles are deep fried. These noodles are often eaten on birthdays as the long noodle represents long life. They are normally chewy and eaten with mushrooms. The noodles themselves were chewy and absorbed some of the flavor from the mushrooms but a tad dry and plain. Real crab pieces were used in this dish.\n\nI had the satay oxtail and tendon noodle soup ($19.95). Broth was DELICIOUS. I could taste the peanut in the broth and the soup reminded me of a mix between a panang curry and kare kare (just put bagoong in the meat!). There was a bit more fat in the oxtail but the meat fell off the bone. My only complaint was that the chopsticks were a bit thick and I had a slightly hard time picking off meat from the oxtail.\n\nShould I come back here next time I'll definitely get an appetizer and a dish to share with another person to cut costs or stick to dim sum. Although the dishes here were decent the restaurant's prices reflect typical Vegas pricing for casual restaurants, which isn't cheap by anyone's standards. If that's the case find a dish that you can't find in your hometown or if you're going to spend that amount of money anyway on a restaurant find one that offers a more unique experience.
2 ||| Wow!  It's been a while since I've written anything, and why not start back up with the diner across the street from my apartment.  Since leaving Boston in September I've been trying all sorts of new places in Charlotte and this came to mind first.\n\nIt's an old style silver on the outside huge booths on the inside kind of place.  It is good for two things - hungover breakfast and I just left the bar and I'm starving! kind of meals.   For breakfast I always get the omelette with avocado and cheddar and hash browns.  My husband always gets grits which I think are gross but he loves them so they must be good.  I've also had the fried chicken and a burger there.  The fried chicken is good and the burger is just ok.  The service is great and everyone is so nice.  The sweet tea (which I've become an expert at since being here) is too sweet, you gotta cut it with water or you'll go into sugar shock.\n\nAll in all not a place to check out, especially when it's only a 2 minute walk from your apartment -  kids in Camden South End...this means you!
4 ||| I wish I were more of a morning person, because I'd be more apt to frequent LJ's. The early bird definitely gets the worm in this case...or at least doesn't have to wait in line for eons. This place is always hoppin', hungry people come in droves.\n\nI LOVE the SCC(eggs with scallions and cream cheese), and their scones are too pretty to eat--okay, who am I kidding. They are lovely, though. \n\nDon't expect a mellow, quiet morning spot. Between the comers and goers, the cooks shouting the names of customers when their order is up, it's craziness. Fun, frantic craziness. A must try!
4 ||| We have been to Nosh several times for both dinner and brunch and are never disappointed. For dinner you can't beat the bruschetta and a bottle of wine. It is probably the best bruschetta that we've ever had. Also the wild boar ragu is an excellent entree. Their Sunday brunch has great mimosas and excellent eggs Benedict and eggs Florentine. Some reviews have commented on portion size, while I agree they're on the smaller side, it's a classic size French portion. As far as service goes, it is always excellent. The chef frequently comes out to check on your meal and chat with customers.
3 ||| Great spicy food. If you like spicy authentic Chinese food this place is as good as those in sf.  Try their Szechwan beef with Mala sauce...if you can take the spice
2 ||| Am on month 4.  Place is quiet and feels safe and the apartment was clean and in good condition.  I don't use the facilities so not sure about that.  Staff is nice & polite.   You can pay your rent online, although, they've outsourced that feature to another company. The bill is always wrong.  Sometimes it's off by as much as $400 making it useless.  The bill makes no sense.  You're charged one line item for sewer & water, and usually 2 or 3 more line items just for sewer.  You're charged a fee to have them bill you for each utility, as well as the actual utility bills themselves.\n\nIt's an inexpensive place to live.  Lot's of stray cats which also means zero problem with rodents.  As Misty mentioned, forget the volleyball court with all the stray cats.\n\nPay by check and don't use the outdoor amenities and you'll be fine.  Will probably be very difficult to find a better place at this price.
1 ||| Originally I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but after I thought it over, it's at best 2.5 stars.  But since there is no 1/2 star, based on the experience, I rounded it down to 2. \n\nWe had to wait for a good 15 minutes even though there were empty tables and despite I was told that we would be first on the list since I was a diamond card holder.  Their reason - to give the servers time to catch up.  Huh?\n\nWe were seated at a booth and it took awhile before our server finally came.  We ordered and then we waited, and waited, and waited!!!  Our server apologized twice for the delay of our food and took our drinks off the bill.  Even she didn't understand why the delay and said 'This is ridiculous!'.  \n\nWhen we finally got the food.  Holy Jesus!  They were HUGE!!!  Had I known how much the food was going to be, we could have shared 1 entree!\n\nI had the Sage Friend Chicken Salad with Mango Vinaigrette Dressing - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=RdfzlSuVWa3eLeZnlGumyw.  It was a WHOLE piece of friend chicken breast which didn't have much flavor at all.  I asked for some ranch dressing (all they had was cucumber ranch dressing) to dip the chicken with.  I quite like the Mango Vinaigrette Dressing but there was just so much food.  I kept eating and eating but there was still mounts of food.  I finally gave up and probably only ate 1/5 of the plate!  I think sometimes where the portion is so big, it actually ruins your appetite!\n\nMy fiance had a bacon burger - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FcGwvwVxr1GdWl653lcnHA.  He said the patties were dry and didn't have much flavor, but fries were good.  \n\nI also ordered a lemonade ice tea that was just bad!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=IC67vw3HBWwLHf2O0wadcA Stick with regular iced.  \n\nI had a coupon (I know, I know, here I go with the coupon again) for $25, our bill was less than $27 (since the drinks were comp'ed).  I only had to pay less than $2 (exclude tips).  I gave her extra tips since she was nice enough to comp our drinks.\n\nThe only way I'd return is if I can eat free (or almost free like this).  With my own money, I'd rather go somewhere with better food!
0 ||| Waited forever in drive thru to finally get my order that was wrong. I could here the employees inside complaining about the lines and really didn't want to be at work. Once home the sides were cold and coleslaw tasted spoiled. Will NOT return
2 ||| I only ordered pho there and wasn't impressed at all but I saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good.  It gave me the feeling that it's a more Americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn. I'm willing to try again.
1 ||| Not a fan of this airport for one reason. There are very few ways to charge anything. Lots of chairs but no outlets. Not sure how such a busy airport can have such few options. Security was also a little strange I had pre-check which got me into a different line but then we just merged with everyone else. How does so much of the general public qualify for the pre-check line. It's not as bad as Midways system but it's up there.  Also I know it's 120 outside but does it have to be 90 on the inside?
1 ||| This theater remains one of the last remnants, a leftover reminder of what Fashion Square once was. It wasn't always so posh. No, Fashion Square used to be kinda low-rent rather than fancy pants. It used to be packed with kids ditching school, anchored by a fuckin' Sears and you even used to be able to smoke inside. Before that, it was originally a small somewhat open-air 3 story building anchored by a grocery store and a mid-level clothing department store. \n\nToday Fashion Square is more of a destination for tourists looking for a swanky desert oasis shopping experience and a place for the wealthy and financial elite to escape the proletariat masses. It's The Mall of America of the Southwest.\n\nGiven the transformation Fashion Square has gone through, it's clear this Harkins theater needs to be redone or removed. It'll take more than a facelift. This theater sticks out like a whore in church not just as a contrast to the mall it lives in, but also among other Harkins Theaters that speckle the valley. It's one of the worst examples left... \n\nTo be honest, it was never a very good theater. Many of the screening rooms are tiny and they clean it about as well as an 8th grader cleans his room. Sticky floors, empty wrappers, and a layer of crud on everything that you could scrape off with your fingernail - the crud probably being a mixture of milk dud coating, fake butter flavoring, and dead skin. \n\nThe location is awful - it's stuck at the end of the food court. When there's a sneak preview, they have everyone line up on the upstairs walkway in the mall... not the best way to save a spot in line if you're handicapped and have to take the elevator. If there's a big movie out and somehow everyone wants to see it in this shit-hole, they have you spilling out into the food court dining area creating a traffic nightmare and a bit of a mess. \n\nWhat they need to do is remove a few theaters and expand the lobby so people can wait inside... they could also expand the small theaters. 5 screens is enough... Actually, a better use of the space would be to fill the theaters up with garbage and then fill in the Lobby and hallway with cement and turn the front into a Cinnabon or something.
1 ||| just ok....
3 ||| I have been seeing Dr. Johnnie Woodson for years.  He is always very nice and willing to talk to me about my condition at length.  The office has gotten so much better since new management has taken over.\n\nSometimes the wait is a bit longer than I would like but the Doctor is wortht the wait!
3 ||| This is a very family-friendly, casual seafood restaurant with nice portions and great prices.  They serve both fried and broiled seafood, as well as steak and chicken. I had the broiled salmon with the baked sweet potato and salad bar.  I also tried a vinegar-based cole slaw (think similar to cold sauerkraut) from the salad bar and it was great. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient.
2 ||| It's Cracker Barrel standard. Good food at a reasonable price. They know how to cook eggs TO ORDER (which can be something of a rarity). They don't come out over easy or over medium no matter how you actually order them and the ingredients are good for the price. The place gets busy...especially in the winter and fall, but no problem now. If you want a quality breakfast at a good price, stop on in.
0 ||| Without a doubt this is the worst and horribly managed McDonald's in the entire universe.\n\n11 minutes to get an unsweetened tea with light ice if you can't get that order right you really shouldn't be working anywhere other than the hospital that did your lobotomy. I am convinced they are only in business because they have a golden arches and people who know no better go there. \n\nI will not be making that mistake again!
3 ||| The mood here, or more specifically the mood that this place fosters is its greatest feature.  It possesses an originality and genuineness that is rare.  It's \"a small, modest, European-style restaurant\" that has a big city growing up around it, it's obviously adapting to it's circumstances though but it has avoided becoming generic.  \n\nThe menu items are entirely defined by one or more of the following:  organic, fresh/local, health conscience, and unprocessed.  Their lemonade is perhaps the best I've ever had, and I've only ever had a better Tri-tip sandwich in Austin TX.  The staff are willing to customize nearly anything on the menu for you which I great for people with allergies or sensitives.  Chop Shop isn't without it's faults though which are a product of its virtues; the line to order is insufferable from 11-2, the wait time for food is consistently inconsistent, the seating is terribly uncomfortable and equally scarce, and if you're there for a beer or any drink you have no option but to wait in the unreasonably long line to get it.  \n\nFour stars is perhaps insufficient but five is quite deserved (yet).  Regardless, I'm very happy this place exists and I'm a regular.  #favoriterestaurantintempe
0 ||| Was having a great time until I realized they house six captive dolphins. Was shocked...they are literally in a swimming pool. Really sad. No thanks i'll stay elsewhere next time.
0 ||| This company was recommended and will never use them again. I called to schedule a dryer vent cleaning and at first Jeremy seemed really cool over the phone. Unfortunately, that was the only good thing that I can remember. On the day of my appt, they were an hour and a half late. Then upon arrival, they didn't even have the correct equipment to do the job!!!! I have a dryer/washer stack combo and they couldn't move the machine! They simply stated that they checked the vent on the exterior of the building and  concluded that our vent was good to go for another 3 years. I wasn't around majority of the time of the service but despite not being able to do the job needed, they had charged us the full amount to do pretty much nothing. I could go on and on and in details about everything that happened but I won't. The thing I still don't understand is that being in the business of cleaning dryer vents, why did they not have the proper equipment to do the job?? Sure their prices seemed good but as for honesty, I wouldn't trust their judgement. I hired an honorable and awesome company to do the job after such terrible service and boy did they do a 200% better job!
4 ||| Great Service and Friendly staff. In and out quickly. Will go back for additional services when my truck needs it.
0 ||| One star for the soda machine ...\n\nWe were not impressed .. Where to start ...\n\nCustomer service - bad, no hello ,no welcome, no nothing .. Attitude like they didn't want to be there or wanted us there.\n\nFries - who likes soggy over salted fries? Not any of us!\n\nWings - we tried mild,  original hot and atomic..  They were dry, small and lacked flavor :(\n\nMaybe it was on off nigh, but since its not worth the price, we are not coming back .. Should of gone to BWW is what all three of us said.
1 ||| With so many rave reviews, you would think this place would be great outside of the 11pm-4am hammered crowd timeframe, but not so much.\n\nAlthough getting a seat is much easier, this place is not really recommended for just a regular dinner.  Maybe it's because I'm not the biggest \"squeaky curds\" fan, but no one at the table seemed to be blown away by the various assemblies of fries, gravy and cheese.\n\nI have had other poutines that would knock your socks off drunk, sober, or anytime of the day, but this would not be worth it unless you're drunk enough to wait forever in a line to inhale something that will make your hangover a little less painful.
4 ||| We had the most amazing server!!  He was so attentive to our needs.  The biggest thing I noticed is when he came by to take our order, he would notice that we were talking and he would make a round to come back again.  He didn't want to disrupt the conversation.  It was so polite!!\nThe food was also great.  Between the four of us, not one of us had a complaint.  I would for sure go again and I would tell others to go as well.  \nOh and the atmosphere is super fun too :)
1 ||| This place is overstaffed, and in fact right when you walk in there is no warm welcome to the store. Everyone who works there is busy. Sadly my experience here was dissapointing because they didn't have what I was looking for. \n\nThe store seems to be under construction. There was a bum in the music section just playing his little heart out on the piano, all intoxicated. (felt uncomfy)\n\nThere is no variety of product. Service is poor.
3 ||| The seafood is excellent!
2 ||| I was pretty disappointed with this place! Maybe its because I had high expectations after everything I've heard. The menu was pretty weak and I was surprised at the lack of variety. I ordered a flatbread pizza and it was good but pretty pricey! I'd probably go back but I'm not in a rush,  hopefully next time it's a better experience.
3 ||| After months of begging I finally granted my girlfriend her wish to check this place out.\n\nSince we were on a time constraint lunch I decided to order the Recession Special Plate; this is a Ham and Swiss on a baguette that comes with a side salad for less than $6.  The only gripe that i have is that the bread was stale and almost impossible to chew. Not sure if its part of the \"Recession Experience\"  but I guess you get what you pay for . . .\n\nOther than that the decor, atmosphere and specially the service was impeccable.
1 ||| Got the pad see ew and a couple drinks. Bartender was friendly and food tasted delicious. Reason for two stars is because they seemed disorganized, and the bartender told me that ordering food was separate from the bar so they had us open two tabs. Waitress from Thai food place did not honor the 50% off one entree offer on yelp. She dropped off the check and never came to pick it back up, nor did she ever check up on us. Thankfully, the bartender grabbed utensils and took care of us even though it was the other waitresses job
1 ||| Was very excited to eat at a GR place since my whole family watches all his shows and I own several of his cookbooks. Ordered the burger medium it came out raw. However they didn't refire it. They gave a whole new burger. The fried calimari must have been baby squid as the ring size was infinitesimal and all breading. Then the fish for the fish and chips just didn't taste good at all. However the star was the 3 mini pies. Steak and ale, Shepards and chicken pot.
2 ||| Little Buddha is kind of like an upscale, more expensive PF Changs. If the thought of that scares you, this probably isn't the restaurant for you. Don't come here looking for authentic dishes. This place is an asian fusion spot that has many familiar items on its menu. So, if you're craving popular sushi items or Chinese dishes, chances are Little Buddha has them.\n\nThe highlight of our meal was the ahi tuna pizza ($15). Beautiful, fresh slices of tuna sashimi topped garlic naan bread. Each bite was a flavor explosion with a salty, citrusy, spicy taste thanks to the abundance of toppings ranging from tomatoes to sriracha to microgreens.\n\nEverything else was pretty average. The jalape\u00f1o yellowtail ($20) was bland. The King's roll ($20) with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado and rice crackers was decent, but the flavors were all muddled. The chicken chow mein ($20) was incredibly oily (although tasty for my Americanized palate). And, the vegetable fried rice ($8) is something you can get anywhere else for a fraction of the price.\n\nThe ambiance is kinda like Tao, but not as grand or over-the-top. We dined there on a Sunday night and, while there were lots of people there, it seemed unusually quiet.\n\nThis place isn't bad as long as you're not expecting a world-class meal. Of course it's going to be pricey since it's in one of the more popular casinos. 3 stars, but mainly for the ahi tuna pizza. Otherwise, it's probably closer to 2.
2 ||| If I was writing this review 2 years ago this place would have 5 stars without a doubt. The food in this place is really good and the service is also but they've gotten greedy. I've been coming here for years and we liked this place so much we'd come at least 2-3 times a week for lunch and other times for take out. I highly recommend the tenderloin beef in black pepper sauce with portabella mushrooms, their fried rice and spicy crispy shirmp.\n\nThe prices have been on increasing regularly and the amount of food has gone down drastically, not good business. This last time I went for dinner with my parents and we all noticed how small the portions have gotten, it was really bad and that irritated me. The only good thing is that the quality of the food is still there but their competition is very close by (less than a mile down the road) and they've been consistent for years.
2 ||| I had no clue I've the sophistication of an earthworm when it comes to food until I read other Zoes Kitchen reviews.  For our information, looking at the Zoe's Kitchen web page, I found out they are a national chain.  Call-in/Take-out and catering are  big parts of the business model.   The fine points of excellence are up to the franchisee.  \n\nIt looks like people having the worst experiences come in for lunch.  We tried Zoes for an evening meal.  Nicely styled with an attractive glass wall on the north facing McDowell Street.  Outdoor dining.  \n\nWe got a chicken kabob and a hummus and salad plate.  Both came with a haystack of mixed green salad with onion, Greek olives and feta.  That's fine with me.  The health survey my insurance company bribed me to fill out determined I don't eat enough greens and fruits.  Score one for Zoe's there. Each table had a bottle of Greek dressing so salads are seasoned to taste.  Mine also came with a tiny tub of Tzatziki.\n\nThe chicken kabob was good.  Chicken, green pepper, onion, cherry tomato.  I found out I like cherry tomatoes much more when they're grilled.  Apparently my family has a gene for fresh tomato aversion.  The grilled cherry T's were very good, the chicken not overcooked, and the rest of the veggies very good.  \n\nThe amount of hummus, about 3/4 cup, was decent, the pita was served as small wedges.  The taste was hummus and pita.  Not Great, not Terrible.  \n\nOur beverages were endless ice tea.  \n\nThe bit of the meal that was unprofessional in the food service industry was a salad core in Sweet D's greens pile.  The price of our meal was $21.00.   I'm thinking the goal of this Mediterranean fast food franchise is a meal for $10.  We'll go back.  After we try more of the eateries at 7th Ave and McDowell.
4 ||| I'm a Wisconsinite who doesn't really care for ice-cream (yes, we do exist) and I love this stuff. It's probably the only ice-cream that I will eat.\n\nI had Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream as a treat when I was growing up. If you're not a local and can't stop by here often, you HAVE to try their Blue Moon and Zanzibar. Blue Moon is a unique flavor of ice-cream that's virtually impossible to find outside of WI. And they are known for their Zanzibar.\n\nEven the classic flavors here are delish. Their cookie dough is smooth and creamy with flecks of chocolate and soft and tasty chunks of cookie dough. They offer lots of flavors, sometimes it's hard to choose.\n\nThe service can be hit-or-miss and on summer weekends the place is packed. This is TRUE ice-cream. It's creamy and thick and delicious. Don't think about how many calories you're eating, just enjoy and experience it.
0 ||| As I am writing this review I have yet to see my food. We have been given complimentary chips & salsa. However, I have seen 2 other tables get their food before me. This is terrible service...please beware of this chili's as you will wait for food for it to be warm.
3 ||| I can't believe I haven't updated my review for this place in 2 years! Well in that time I have come here several times and have brought family here. I found the key to liking this restaurant....the eggs florentine. This is way better than their omelets, the hollandaise is good and the mushroom, tomato, and spinach that is on the bene is fresh and delicious. The service is always good and the coffee is also always tasty. I like that they serve their coffee in glass cups so you can watch the coffee mix with the creamer....I know, kind of odd, but try it....it's very entertaining! This place is definitely worth a try.
1 ||| First things first ... THIS IS NOT A REGULAR COSTCO! It's a \"business center.\" \n\nI feel that this is very important to mention, because I was very disappointed when I came during my weekend stay in Vegas. My bf and I wanted to hit up Costco for a case of water for our room and to get alcohol for a friend's bday gift.\n\nNO ALCOHOL SOLD HERE. Although, they do sell tobacco if you're into that kind of thing. \n\nNO FOOD COURT. But, why would you want a food court when you can eat at all the delicious food places and buffets on the strip?! \n\nAs I mentioned, this is a business Costco so you'll definitely find lots of snacks and drinks for vending machines. They even sell vending machines here! I did enjoy the fact that they had a huge array of drinks (juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, etc.) It was quite impressive. \n\nAll in all, this Costco was pretty depressing. Very few workers ... workers that don't really know their stuff. I asked the guy checking memberships at the front if they had any coupon books and he said the guest/member service would have some. Waited in line and it turns out ... THEY DON'T EVEN ACCEPT THE COUPONS HERE. \n\nI'll definitely be shopping at the Costco back in L.A. before heading out to Vegas next time..
2 ||| I'm not a big sports fan.  In fact, I'm not a sports fan (I watch for cheerleaders, car crashes when my wife isn't around).  We had a group dinner here, but our reservations got messed up and our group of 13 was going to be put at two separate tables.  After some protracted negotiation, we were put in a small glassed off room.\n\nFrom then on, it was a good experience.  The food menu was largely burgers (and some of the best buffalo wings I have had in a long time) and large beers (24 ouncers).\n\nAfterwards, we headed upstairs to the gaming zone, an area with sports-ish video games.  It was a little weird playing video games iwth co-workers, but we had a blast on the different driving games.\n\nIf sports on TV is your thing, this is your place.  Otherwise, its just another okay restaurant with lots of TVs on the multiple ESPN stations.
2 ||| If you're looking for beer selection + happy hour, this is definitely the place.  You really have to get here early for happy hour b/c after 5 or so it gets REALLY hard to get a table.  The app and drink specials are good.\n\nWe've been here a few times and feel so-so about it.  We were looking for a cheap HH close to home so we went to try some new things.  Upon walking in, we saw a couple sitting outside with a little wooden stand holding 6 samples.  We asked our waiter about it and it's their \"six pack\" which contains six samples pre-chosen by them for about $9.  We tried it and I liked more of them than my husband as he generally likes lighter beers and I tend to like amber ales.  I would order it again - it's fun to mix it up and try some new beers and ciders.  Plus, they give you a sheet with the name, origin, and brewery of each selection.  I asked for two samples of other beers and my husband asked for one.  We didn't really care enough for them to order a pint.  \n\nWe also had the egg rolls and jerk wings.  The egg rolls were good, but not great and the wings were a little disappointing.  You know what's even more disappointing?  Getting the bill and seeing a $1 charge for each sample that we asked for.  Seriously?  For a few sips to try them out before ordering a whole pint which would have been in the ballpark of $3?  Our server didn't even mention it when we ordered them.  It's really just the principle.  Not cool Yard House!  They should take a lesson from Papago Brewing where they gladly will give you a free sample to help you decide on a brew.
0 ||| I used to love going here, would eat at least once a week. Today was horrible.  The food has gone down hill, the bathroom was filthy with paper all over the floor and dirty floors. \n\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was a joke.  The special was Bloody Mary's and I had to keep correcting him, by the time he was done...they were a site and he said he'd been working there over a year.  One patron had to ask multiple times for their check.  Another patron asked for a beer with no fruit, the bartender was insistent on adding fruit and the patron stated that she did not want fruit in her beer. He commented, it's a citrus blend, there's already fruit in it. \n\nThe bartender was constantly touching his face, and didn't wash his hands before squeezing lime into the Bloody Mary's, when he couldn't get the garnish of lime on the rim he tossed it in and said \"oh well.\"  When were limes in Bloody Mary's?\n\nThe bartender then disappeared for a bit, took others orders, fiddle farted around...I finally piped up and said we were ready to order.  After our food was brought out, he never checked on us. The fries were over cooked, and our drink glasses were empty.  We had to ask for water and refills.  He tried to take away my friends food before she was done, but left 3 empty drink glasses in front of my other friend. \n\nThe picked up trash off the floor, then started cutting limes without washing his hands.  After he cleared our dishes, he disappeared again, and we sat there waiting to pay.  He came back and started working on another task and I had to ask for the check.  He bright the check, we paid by credit card, he brought the paperwork back for us to sign and just stood there.  After we filled it out and signed it, he still just stood there, then he said that he was supposed to get the signed copy and I said I know, we are not ready to give it to you yet.  \n\nIn summary, food was not as good as it used to be, and the bartender who had been there for at least a year, needs to be trained in health and safety, customer service, and the items on the menu.
0 ||| Wow...where to begin with this place?  I call up the night of going there to see if a reservation was needed.  They tell me they always suggest a reservation....so i proceed to see if they have anytime available for 8 o clock that evening.  They do...Great!!  I head over to Sutra which is the \"new\" sushi place to go to in scottsdale.  Excited to try some new sushi in town we walk in to an 80% empty restaurant wondering why they suggested we make a reservation??  The restaurant looked identical to the previous lounge that occupied this space, La Rouge.  There were minimal changes and the same furniture remained which i thought was disappointing.  I thought they would have given Sutra its own identity.  They might as well had called it La Rouge and told people they now serve sushi.  The next disappointing thing about Sutra was the service....BRU-TAL!!  Im talking painful to sit through.  The waitress came over and introduced herself and asked if we wanted drinks.  We wanted to see their wine list along with the martini list.  She had to make two seperate trips to find both of these menus.  Finally she delivered the menus to us as if they were the only menus in the restaurant and we were lucky to have received them.  Then, after looking over the sushi menu for 20 minutes and finally deciding on what we wanted, the waitress came over to look over our order and make sure she was aware of everything we wanted.  After she looked it over she asks, \":Oh, did they tell you what the deal was tonight??\"  We all looked at each other and said, \"No, whats the deal here tonight?'  She says, \"We are not serving any hot food tonight and any of the sushi that contains tempura (a fried breading) is not available, however, edamame and miso soup are still available.  Hmmm....\"Why didnt they mention that when i made a reservation\" I pondered.  And why didnt the server mention this the first three times she visited our table for that matter.  Half the items that we ordered were immediatly eliminated and we had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what we wanted.  Finally, we decide and the waitress takes our order.  As the night progressed the service and experience just got more interesting.  The food was brought out by runners and the waitress had no clue what had been brought out and what hadnt.  She was asking US what still needed to come out.  Kinda weird...thought that was her responsibility to know what still needed to come out??  So after eating a few mediocre rolls of sushi we all decided that we were full and couldnt eat anymore.  We asked the server to cancel the last two dishes that hadnt arrived yet.  She looked at us like we were from Mars and said, \"Oh, you guys didnt get everything?\"  She canceled the remaining dishes and proceeded to talk to us for literally a half hour.  \"About what\" you are wondering.  I have no clue...all i know is that i felt 1000 times dumber after she was done.  So, I think you get the idea.  This place should live about as long as La Rouge did...and hopefully not that long.  This was a painful dining experience.  Very disappointing coming from the people that own Barcelona and Danny's car washes.  This dinner was more annoying than the guys at the car washes that ask you if you want your windshield repaired everytime you go to fill up!  SUCKED...Dont go!
4 ||| With a rich atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and food to die for, this restaurant is truly something special\n\nMy wife and I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, Stuffed Mushrooms, Chicken Bellagio, and Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. \n\nEvery morsel of what we ate was divine.\n\nI highly recommend the mushrooms, and trying the Bellagio put my mouth in food Heaven.\n\nTiana C was extremely pleasant waiting on us, and other than maybe prices being a \"smidge\" high, and I do mean just a smidge, there's nothing I would change about Cheesecake Factory
0 ||| We got a deal for $45 per night during a conference so we stayed here. There was also a $15 per night resort fee which said it covered in-room internet, the gym, etc. When it said in-room internet I just assumed it meant wireless. It doesn't. You pay $15 per night for wired internet (if you brought a cable and if you can find the plug...we couldn't). \n\nThere is no wifi available at all in the rooms. None. So, the first day I camped in Starbucks all day and paid $9.99 for slow wifi. On the second day I discovered that if you sit in the Bazaar area, you can connect to the MGM or Mirage free wifi and get better signal that you can get from the service you have to pay for elsewhere in the hotel. The chairs are also more comfortable and the ladies that work at the snack shop there are really nice.\n\nOur room was in one of the towers and it looked like it hadn't been upgraded in ages. The door handles were all scuffed and scratched. For some reason you don't get a real comforter either. Just a sheet, a thin blanket and a \"satin\" cover. Saving on laundering costs I suppose?\n\nThe walls are also very thin. We could hear everything going on in the rooms next door. Even just the flush of a toilet can be heard.\n\nThe elevators are literally falling apart. Many buttons are missing and the control panel is exposed in many of them. I felt oh so safe.\n\nThe housekeeping staff doesn't follow the \"towels on the floor need to be replaced, those hanging don't\" rule. I try to conserve water in hotels by not asking for new towels every day. I don't get them at home, why would I in  hotel? But they replaced them every day anyway. Not very \"green.\"\n\nMy final, and biggest, complaint is that the room keys are terrible. In 3 days I had to get 4 new keys because they stop working if you get them anywhere near a credit/debit card or a cell phone. I'm a girl, I keep everything in a purse. How am I supposed to keep the key away from everything in my purse? I tried by surrounding the room key with business cards but that didn't work.\n\nOne night at 3 AM, I returned to my room and my key didn't work. I went to the front desk to get it fixed (again) and they said their system was down so they couldn't give me a new key. They told me to wait by the elevators for someone from housekeeping to let me in my room. I waited by the elevators and no one showed up. So I went back to the front desk and finally got a new key. When I got up to my room, the phone rang and it was housekeeping telling me that someone from the front desk was \"looking for me\" and then put me on hold. I hung up after waiting 30 seconds.\n\nI will never stay at this hotel again. I guess you really do get what you pay for.
4 ||| Really good fried catfish!  I was not really fond of catfish until I tried Jamburrito's way of serving it. The jambalaya rice makes the perfect accompaniment for the crunchy delight. The people serving the food are very friendly and the total experience definitely makes Food Truck Fridays a weekly event to look forward to.
2 ||| Visited PHX for my first time and found this place through yelp.  I ordered the special of the week which was Buffalo Brulee Burger.  One point of improvement is that they could add the price to the bottom of the burger.  I didn't know I was going to pay $8ish+tax.  It was fine since it's my 1st time trying it.\n\nThe cashier was pleasant, wasn't overly enthusiastic and seemed kind of bored.  He took my order and handed it over to the kitchen.  I did notice that the cook had to come out to see what other ingredients were in that burger.  I was quite perplexed by this.  Shouldn't you know everything on your menu by heart?  This is my second point of contention.\n\nOne thing I didn't expect was for them to bring the food to your table.  I thought that added a nice personal touch to it.\n\nThe meat was juicy despite them not asking me how I want my burger to be cooked.  The lettuce and scallions were fresh.  The cucumbers were cooked, not sure if people like that or not but I had no issues with it.  The buffalo sauce was flavorful and had a subtle kick to it.  Not enough kick to the point where you need water.  The burnt sugar bun was interesting.  You can see the sugar melted onto the bun but at the same time you could see the crystals.  Some of the crystals did not fully melt so when you bit into the burger, sometimes those crystals got stuck in your teeth or gave you a sensation of eating sand.  They just need to be more thorough.  If I had only tried this burger, I would have given them 4 stars, but I tried their french toast fries.\n\nThe french toast fries is exactly as it sounds, they basically take the corners of the bread, turn it into french toast, then deep fry it and put powdered sugar on it.  They also give you a side of syrup which was very watered down.  I think the fries would have tasted a lot better if they had more bread component than just the edges.  You can definitely taste the oil on these things so it should be toned down a bit.\n\nThe decor was alright, the light fixtures were kind of odd and not sure what they were trying to go for.  They do have good food photos of their products though.  The bathroom was okay.  Not terribly dirty, very spacious, but wished it would be a lot brighter inside.\n\nDespite the 3 stars, I would definitely come back here again and would recommend this place with the caveat that not everything is up to par.
4 ||| Gandhi is awesome. Please don't take my word for it, go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and I bet you you'll fall in love with it. This comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish!
2 ||| The location of this place is pretty unfortunate (in the ghost town that is City North).  And I might be spoiled by other yogurt shops, but the variety seemed to be lacking.  The saving grace would have to be the 1/2 price Tuesday Twitter word of the day!
3 ||| I raised my rating to four stars due to I returned for lunch today. The restaurant is close to where our conference was being held and was squeezed on time. I tried the lunch special - a bowl of curry on rice and a bowl of pork ramen with miso broth. Food tasted better today and was less salty.(Maybe because I drank last night?) The portion of ramen was still quite large and curry was very tasty for a bargain price of $12.95 including tip.
1 ||| HIT AND MISS. MOSTLY MISS. GO FOR THE TUNA STARTER AND ORDER A DOUBLE PORTION; REAL HIT!\n\nTHE FOOD\n-- tuna sashimi dish is great value, great flavors. order it.\n-- coconut rum with watermelon liqueur a winner, if only the bartender would remember to add the fruit. do you need a recipe book?\n-- hash with eggs arrives eggs-over-hard despite my instructions for easy\n-- toasted english muffin slathered with butter, but not toasted.\n-- chicken salad's chicken was bland except for the rub on the edge. boo.\n-- taco plate features raw, unprepared corn tortillas. yeah, i can pull one from the bag and dump something in it too! why would i pay for that?\n-- salsa too salty\n-- cole slaw just not interesting, ends up a plate filler. blech.\n\nTHE DECOR\n-- hip sealed concrete, bulk tiki statues everywhere, and faux Eames chairs complete the hip look, framed by Green-Apple table shades and roll-up garage-door walls.\n-- designers kept the awesome hexagon street-facing window and high ceilings in the bar area. kudos.\n\nTHE REST\n-- starting to develop a pet peeve for \"sauces\" delivered via ketchup squirter bottle atop my item or side dish. IT GOES UNDERNEATH THE ITEM OR NEXT TO IT! OR IMAGINE.... IN IT.\n-- no reservation taken unless you've got six in your party. BOO. be ready for 30-minute wait in summer when no one's sitting outside.
3 ||| The DMV stereotype has been around since the beginning of time.  I have to admit that the Henderson DMV isn't that bad.  I know you are gasping for air right now.  \"How could he say that about the DMV?\"  Every time I come here the employees are super nice.  In fact I was surprised the first time, but now come to know that they hired some great people.  This is a hard job and they do a great job making the process as enjoyable as they can.  The last time we went we were registering a car we just bought.  We only waited about 30 mins and it was Saturday morning.  So needless to say it was pretty packed.  When we were going through the process the girl (I wish I could remember her name.) told us that our smog was rejected.  I was confused because this was the dealership's fault.  She was really nice and told us to go take care of it and when we got back to come back to her.  After yelling at the dealership and having them resmog the car, we went back.  The girl was with a customer so we waiting a few minutes.  Here is where it gets better.  The lady working next to her was done with her customer before our girl and then she helped us.  This was awesome!  She also gave our daughters stickers.  Don't let the DMV scare you.  This place is great and the employees make it better.  Bet you never thought someone would be saying this about a DMV!  Cheers!
0 ||| I don't know where to start, but overall, it was a lousy experience.\n\nI don't frequent any DD very often, but stopped at this one on the way to work for breakfast today.\n\nI got a flatbread breakfast sandwich, hash browns, and a pumpkin latte. The latte tasted like sewer water and I gave up trying to drink it after half the cup. The hash browns were actually pretty good, but the guy who handed me the food (who was the manager) didn't give/ask about ketchup. The sandwich was incredibly dry and the bread was hard/stale.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the entire thing only cost $6, but I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nAs far as food, you're 0 for 3, Dunkin.
3 ||| Good luck on trying to find this little gem! It's definitely not an easy find, but if you're one of the lucky ones who do find it, you know just how delicious it is!\n\nI'm not a huge ramen eater, so when my friends suggested we try this little place, let's just say that I wasn't super thrilled. But I like hanging out with friends and will try just about anything, so figured why not. And boy am I glad I did.\n\nWhile the ramen bowls start at $8 and you have to pay additionally for each topping, it doesn't make it the cheapest meal. (My thoughts on this is more or less for college kids, since it's on Mill...). However, with that said, my $11 meal here, was totally worth it and suuuuuper delicious! So much so, that I'd even enjoy going back!
2 ||| This is a review of the casino.  I play craps and I'm used to the cocktail waitresses coming around often and remembering my drink order.\n\nI played for two hours and the waitress couldn't seem to remember to bring me a rum and coke.  Later in the evening, we ordered drinks at the bar and it took forever to be helped even though the bar wasn't busy.\n\nThe rooms are nice, but I agree with other reviewers, the Venezia tower rooms are hard to get to.
4 ||| Love it! Great burgers and amazing service at prices about the same than a non-organic chain. It's a great concept
0 ||| Staff was proud to not acknowledge us. We sat at a table in the bar( a dirty one at that) and waited for close to 10 min before walking out.  When we were leaving we asked the bartender \" Are you proud we are leaving?\"  She smiled and said \"yes\".  I guess if you are not a regular, you are not welcome. If I could have given it zero  stars if that were an option.
4 ||| The service and food is great! My wife and I eat here often and highly recommend it for anyone who loves a great sandwich. \nAnother plus is The restaurant is always clean.
4 ||| Partying all night in Vegas would not be complete without a night at Drais! Hot hot crowd. Coool people. Easy to get in. Not easy to leave.
0 ||| I wanted to like this place. I pulled up and was underwhelmed by the appearance of the outside but decided to give it a shot anyway. First, when I initially called and made an appointment they told me it was a $10 charge for gel polish. When I got there, they told me it was an extra $20 for gel polish. $20 extra dollars for some nail polish under a UV light? No. So I decided to get just the regular 30 minute manicure and 30 minute pedicure. \n\nMy manicure lasted a measly 15 minutes. And the pedicure was the worst I have ever had. That is saying a lot considering I get pedicures every 2 weeks and have done so for the last 10 years. My toenails look like they were painted by my 3 year. Honestly, my two week old pedicure from before looked better than what I have on my nails right now. In addition to that, the pedicure chairs do not recline and do not have massage. Maybe fine normally, but I am 8 months pregnant and I had to sit uncomfortably for the duration of the pedicure because the chairs do not adjust at all. \n\nI came here because I had a Spa Finder gift card and my regular nail place doesn't accept them. Highly disappointed and now I have to go get my toes redone because they look like utter crap and I can't reach them myself.
2 ||| Best wings ever (besides Zipps Golden wings...)! We order a bucket of hot to go and can't wait to get them home! Other things we've tried aren't the greatest, except for the fried calamari. Super good and not chewy like most I've had. Their new patio is really nice and looking forward to the cold nights when they have the fireplace going.
0 ||| The staff seemed friendly, until I got my car back after denying their $300 brake replacement job. They broke an item in my car and they refused to admit it, plus the AC was on full blast.
0 ||| Mediocre in every way.  Service and food.  Overreliance on salt in the remoulade was a disappointment from this name.  The whole place looked tired and past prime.
1 ||| I am not a big fan of Las Vegas shows because they do not interest me.  Mystere is the first cirque du soleil show I've been to and that's only because my gf took me here for my birthday. After watching the show I had a real conundrum about writing a review for this show because cirque fan boys can construe my opinion controversial. \n\nLas Vegas is a town for people to come to spend money to get entertained, so my review will primarily focus on the value proposition of the ciruqe shows. Is this show worth spending $100-150 for 90 minutes? No. There isn't any unique acrobatic material in this show that isn't available on the Internet or on tv shows like America's got talent. The filler part before the next act of the show is being prepared is really not that funny.  I will not go into details about the show since it my spoil the show for some. I think I can get more entertainment out at a movie theater for $10. \n\nI honestly think that ciruqe shows are a scam created by casino industry to get more money out of people's pockets.
3 ||| We went for a friends birthday party. I like the intimate setting. I'm usually not a comedy fan, but I laughed quite a bit at 3 out of the 4 comedians. There was a Fetish Ball going on next door, which confused me at first b/c I didn't understand why leather masks and nipple clamps were the dress code for a comedy club, but once I saw the little neon \"Comedy Spot\" sign, I figured it out. Overall its a great place to go on a  weekend. Assless chaps optional.
2 ||| The fried oysters are to die for.\n\nThe crayfish scampi looks great but a bit too garlicky.\n\nThe BBQ shrimp is just a-ok.\n\nReal cool how they turned an old house into CQ.
3 ||| You can get anything and everything you can get from Costco in behemoth size.  I usually wouldn't write about a chain, but this Costco has to be one of the better organized and there are an abundant amount of workers to help you out.  Be prepared to spend at least $100.  You think you only need a few things, but you keep adding up more.  On this particular occasion for whatever reason, I spent more than $400.  I was definitely packing it in for the winter hibernation.  Lastly, they have their food court indoors, which is essential considering your food or icre cream would wither away in the 110 degree heat.
0 ||| Out of business as of June 3, 2011!  When I called to make a reservation to use my Groupon, which does not expire until June 21, I was told that the restaurant was shut down for renovation for the rest of the summer, and that the Groupon would not be honored when they reopen.  These people are thieves.
4 ||| This is the best Thai food I have had from their eggplant dish to their pad thai noodle dishes to the soups and the many other dishes I have tried there. I always keep coming back not only for the food but the great service. \n\nThe pricing is pretty standard, $8-9 for a dish but they are large portions so definitely worth it.\n\nThe only negative is the lack of choice for dessert. They only have coconut ice cream (which is really good) and coconut custard. \n\nThe place is usually not crowded so you're immediately seated with no wait time (I've been there for both lunch and dinner). \n\nThe bathrooms are okay, they need a bit of updating but are clean. \n\nI gave it a 5 star mainly for the food and service, things like the dessert menu and the bathrooms can be easily \"remodeled\".
4 ||| First time trying in n out today. I was surprised how simple and plain the menu was. Burgers, fries and shakes; that's it. I liked how simple it was. We tried #2 (cheese burger fries and drink). This place is very clean I was so impressed. The kitchen is clean and you can watch what they're doing, the tables and floors and ketchup/mustard/ drink area was clean. The staff were friendly and they kept maintaining the eating area. Again, I was so impressed. Our food was awesome. Fried weren't greasy or too salty, burgers were great, they put the perfect amount amount of lettuce and tomato on it. Looking forward to my next visit!
3 ||| This is a good solid hobby store. Their stuff is not as complete as HobbyTown USA right across the street but is nonetheless worth a visit if you are in town.
0 ||| I'm not sure that's it's fair that I review this place, because we didn't actually eat here. Heck, we didn't even sit down. We walked in on a Friday night around 7 for dinner. Inside smelled like a hospital and when we found our way down the hallway, there were probably 6 tables out of 30 filled, and everyone there was eligible for a Medicare card. \n\nWe didn't stay.
3 ||| This rating is based on food more than service, which is fine, I'd rather have great food & so-so service\n\nIn town for yet another trade show, we ran from the strip & found this place (thanks yelpers!!)\nSmallish, cramped space, and packed! So we knew it must be good.\nThey fit us in with no res (on a Thursday), and the service was decent, not rude, but rushed & they got one thing wrong, but not major.\nThe menu is augmented with \"specials\" on paper all over the walls. Helps if you speak Japanese I think (another good sign).\nSo we just kept ordering more after looking around, and everything was GOOD. \nThis is not your typical \"American\" sushi joint with Calif roll/ spicy tuna roll. This is real Japanese food, some twists like Jalapeno friend rice, which we heard was good from the guy next to us.\nSo if you want GOOD, fresh, real food, this is the place.\nMaybe make a res!\nAnd there's a bakery next door that has yummy dessert.\nGo across the street for a fab foot massage to end the evening.
3 ||| If you aren't prepared to flash the cash for The Wynn or The Bellagio (and I don't blame you) The Mirage is the way to go. I would have never stayed here prior to the room upgrades but this is now my regular Vegas hotel. \n\nThey have great restaurants (BLT Burger) and a Starbucks on premises. Staff are always friendly enough and there is everything you would expect to be able to have a serious gamble in a major Strip casino.\n\nThe real gem here is the Beatles/Cirque Du Soliel show 'Love' - I have seen it twice and it really is the best show I have ever seen period.
3 ||| Bring your own wine and hang out in a trendy location in the plateau! The veal scallopini is good. as well as the lobster bisque! The lines are long but if you go on a nice summer evening it's not such a bother as it's a busy fun street with lots to look at!  Good for the younger crowd who don't mind hanging around waiting.
1 ||| This place is the pits!! They don' take reservations and parking here sucks.  We went for the Las Vegas Dining Out week that is supposed to benefit local charities. We got there at 11:20 am on a Friday and were told there was a 20 minute wait for lunch. FML!  OK give my cell phone number to the hostess who puts it into her snazzy iPad then we go sit.  \n\nWe wait, we wait, we wait some more. Finally I get a text message our table is ready. While this feature is really cool here's where it goes all wrong.  Only one hostess behind the stand [not good]. She's on the phone....there's a long line of people waiting to give their information to her...we walk to the front of the line to claim our much anticipated table.  Guy in line starts yelling out us for cutting the line!!!  So it sure does appear we were doing that, how would he know that the table is on my phone and it's indeed our turn to sit, not a good way to start the meal after long wait time already.\n\nWe sit down. We ask for the Las Vegas Dining Menu.  Which is difft from what's on the site, but OK no biggie.  It also wasn't offered to us???  boooooo   PS- We are spending a fixed cost of $30.12 for lunch that's how this deal works so we aren't expecting to have a 'cheap meal' here.  \n\nThey mess this all up from there on out.  Meals came out before apps, apps came out 1.5 mins before meals, there wasn't enough room on the table, the place is cramped so people keep knocking into our chairs, purses are falling on floor, waitress is blaming kitchen b/c this promo just started [which she thinks we are dumb b/c it hadn't just started], too much food on the table, blah blah blah. This list goes on and on and on.\n\nAppies were fine, nothing exciting.  Tomato & Mozz salad had the blandest dang dressing I've ever tasted and HELLO this type of salad needs kick b/c it's very bland to begin with.  Chicken Sandwich was soggie and the bread was ALL wrong. I dissected it like my science project frog and ate parts of it somehow.  Chicken Salad Sandwich got the 'wouldn't order it again' from my boss.  \n\nThe best part of the meal was ---Ding Ding--Dessert!  it was by and LARGE the best part of our experience. SO, if you eat here [I have pix that I posted] only get dessert.   But if you don't have to eat here HEAD OVER TO SUGAR FACTORY, you'll be happier :)
2 ||| Once I walked in, i was greeted and had the option to seat myself wherever I pleased. I had trouble deciding so the waitress recommend the crab cakes and the spinach cheese baked oysters. I washed it down with age pear cider. Oh was it delish! The crab cakes came shortly and it was paired with an aioli tasting sauce. It was really a good combination and I would highly recommend it. It's the best crab cakes I've tried even compared to steelhead diner in Seattle. The oysters came in after 20 minutes after the warning did mention on the menu to allow for up to 35 minutes. It was delicious, but very rich to the taste. It had cheese and spinach and with a spritz of lemon it was just right! \n\nI came during happy hour and they knocked two dollars off my crab cakes or any appetizer and it all totaled up to 23 bucks including tax. It's fairly cheap. \n\nI would come here again! I am a big fan of fresh raw oysters so that would probably be my next purchase.
2 ||| I wish this burger was more memorable. We ate here in may when they had a military 2 for 1 burger promotion so we took advantage of that. They didn't advertise it really, it was just on the website at the very bottom. \n\nOne thing I loved about all three Gordon Ramsay establishments while I was in Vegas this weekend was the Innis and Gunn beer selection on tap. Here they had a stout (a porter at Steam, and a pale ale at Pub&grill). They are oak aged beers and taste awesome. Apparently the server said they were Gordon's fav beers (at least on the menu)and I can see why.   \n\nI did enjoy my burger just didn't blow me away for some reason. I had the euro which was tasty and cooked well. The truffle fries and dipping sauces were very good. Wish I was hungry enough for a shake but too full since this was our third stop on our Gordon Ramsay crawl of the strip.
2 ||| Place is great to look at and part of a creative revival of several older downtown Phoenix buildings turned eateries/bars. \n\nCrowd was a mixed type but leaned towards upwardly mobile hipsters? Some decent craft beers on tap, some wine offered as well. Really great cocktails.\n\nMenu is fairly vast and diverse, I settled on the pretzels (delish with creamy cheese sauce) and the fried chicken (not so great). \n\nServers and helpers were beyond friendly yet completely disorganized this night, but I was in a good mood and opted not to make their lives miserable. Plus they acknowledged every error and forgetful act and we received a majority of the meal for nothing. Big props for that. \n\nOverall I'll be back. Love the environment and cool folks, but the jury is still out on the food overall for me.
4 ||| A year later and this place has only gotten better. You can now sit anywhere and get great service, food is awesome, the bar is still the best place to sit. The wings here is awesome, but I have never had anything that wasn't great. Only complaint, wish they had one more tv at the end of the bar and all the smokers make the patio unusable, but that's a problem every bar has. At least they're not inside. \n\nCindy and Dara are awesome and the clientele is ideal, not to many twenty something's looking to get hammered and no snooty Scottsdale types. I love this place. \n\nMy wife loves the Bingo on Fridays and trivia thurs and sat is fun as well.
3 ||| I went to Gallo Blanco last night with a group of 8, and, overall, I was very happy!  The food was fantastic.  I had the guacamole, smoked elote, a carne asada taco, a shrimp taco, and the tres leches cake.  I loved everything, but especially the elote and the tres leches.  The tres leches was topped with ice cream and strawberry sauce, and it was some of the best I've ever had!  I tasted a friend's shrimp and grits, and that was quite good as well.  I'm from the southeast, so I'm picky about shrimp and grits, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as it was!  I also had a glass of sangria, which was alright, but it was pretty sweet, and there was more fruit in the glass than drink.  That was disappointing.  The service also was not fantastic.  I understand serving a larger group can be difficult, but there were 20 or more minute time spans where we never saw our server.  We were sitting in the lounge area, and the server basically told us that she kind of forgets about that area...not exactly what we wanted to hear.  She was nice and got our orders correct, but I would have preferred a little more attention, especially since we were a larger group.  My only other complaint was that it was rather warm in the area where we were seating, and there's nothing more uncomfortable to me than trying to eat while you're sweating.  Having said that, I really enjoyed the meal, and I will definitely go back.  With everything I ate, my check was under $25 for happy hour!
2 ||| They have great deal on taco Tuesday. It's $1 per taco. I bring all my kids for the night so I don't have to cook. Their salsa bar is pretty good too.
3 ||| they have reallyreally good umeshu.  i have no idea how much it was but it was so rich and sweet and mmmm.  good cooked plates, pretty good sushi chefs.  id definitely recommend sitting at the bar.  they also have very good teppenyaki.  they serve kobe beef teppanyaki.  awesome.  i like the atmosphere.  but not the beeest japanese ive had.
3 ||| two words. MANGO HABANERO ;)\n\nim a regular on tuesdays for .45 cent wings... but damn, do i have to bring my own bottle of Ranch sauce in my purse, since they charge .50 per little bitty serving? I GUESS.
