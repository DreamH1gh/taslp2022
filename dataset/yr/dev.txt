1 ||| I didn't have such a great experience. I ordered 5 tires for my vehicle I was given an awesome price when I called the first time, when I called back to make the purchase the price went up over 200 dollars. I asked what happened and the guy couldn't tell me, He said \" I don't know why its a different price\" so 20 minutes in he got the price down a little bit. I paid for the tires even though the were now 110 dollars more than the first price, and then he said you should have 3 by tuesday and 2 by wednesday because they are coming from texas. The first call he said they were all in stock, so at this point I was like whatever I can wait til wednesday and then I got my tracking numbers that said I won't see them til friday. So I called first thing in the morning and asked what happened he said UPS changed it and he said he will send the issue to customer service and see if they will send a discount  back to me. I checked my email 10 minutes later he issued me a 25 dollar credit, I called customer service and they were full of excuses and it was very apparent that customer satisfaction isn't as important as they claim it is.. Sounds like Big O tires needs my business next time..
1 ||| Eh,\n\nSo much hype, but the burgers are over ground and too big for the bun.  Maybe it was just over hype, but I want all the wonderful burger things to occur when I'm munching a burger, not just tons o' ground beef in a bun.\n\nTry BRGR just up the road.
4 ||| Very good lunch specials! I went here for dinner and had a great meal. I will definitely come back to try some more new, delicious meals.
2 ||| I stopped in with some co-workers to celebrate a birthday lunch. I can't even remember the last time I've been to this place. \n\nSo I decided to review the menu online to see what they had to offer. The lunch and dinner menu are fairly similar. However for lunch they mix it up a little by throwing in  some sandwiches, soups and pizzas. \n\nI decided to go with the pizza and salad combo. I chose the House salad and the Carnevale pizza. \n\nThe salad is just a mix of romaine, carrots and two olives. Nothing fancy. The house dressing is just okay, I'd probably opt for a different one next time. \n\nThe pizza was good. It's topped with pepperoni, fennel sausage, mozzarella and basil. The crust was just okay but the homemade sauce was tasty and I enjoyed the basil it added a nice touch to a pretty common pizza. \n\nIf my coworkers pick this place again I'd head back. Perhaps to try the pasta next time!
2 ||| I love CB. None in California so I come here everytime I come to AZ. Unfortunately food cold today. Out of pie so they said they would put in oven but it takes an hour to cook!!! Now I am checking out and finding my bill is incorrect. Wow...
3 ||| Bombay Grille has excellent chicken korma. Their weekday lunch buffet has really tasty food as well. You can find authentic tandoori chicken , an assortment of curries, sauces, rice, fruity, and vegetarian options. Their naan is pretty awesome as well. What I really like is that their staff are very friendly and knowledgeable! Their prices are very reasonable too. Great place!
0 ||| I walked into this establishment to open a box because it is closer to my home. I waited and when I heard how the employee talked to a customer I was shocked. She was blatantly deceiving this customer.  I decided that this is not the kind of establishment that I wanted to deal with on a daily basis so I decided to just walk out. I am sure that this place would be better if they had a new manager that had better customer service skills.
1 ||| Service was fast and prompt however we all left feeling the food was nothing special potatoes were cold and I am not sure if the omelets were actually cooked in house tasted premade and warmed up in a microwave. I had a professional chef with me and he agreed, there were no skillet cook marks on it and it seemed rubbery
1 ||| I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga combo. Not a fan of the carrots and peas (which is most likely frozen - which they advertise they don't serve \"frozen\" food) they put in the spanish rice (gross) or the brown sludge they call \"beans.\" The chimichanga was alright. Other than the fact that they probably keep the shredded beef sitting in water or beef juice of some sort, when they put it in the tortila, wrap it up, and fry the tortilla, the beef is still kinda watery so when u cut open the chimichanga, theres a pool of water at the bottom, which makes the chimichanga soggy. AHHHHH\n\nSalsa bar is a joke, especially if you order something to go, because they do not supply lids for the salsa containers. Also, none of the salsa is labeled!! So you have no idea which is hot, or mild, or chipotle flavored, or whatever. You have to pretty much take a wild guess as to which one is the one you want, and hope for the best.\n\nIts not the worse place, I have definitely had worse, I did enjoyed about half my dish. Honestly would rather go to FIlaberto's around the corner and get a chimichanga for a couple bucks less and tastes better.\n\nNext time if I ever end up back here, I will most likely try something different.
3 ||| This is a nice treat I allow myself once in a while. I love the garlic bagel. (Truth...I wish Einstein's did not put sesame seeds on their garlic bagel but they added that years ago and I don't think they will ever switch back.)\n\nThe service here has always been quick and they almost always give just the right amout of cream cheese.
2 ||| Chevy's seems to be our go-to \"large group\" place for lunch at work.  They can easily accommodate a large group on little to short notice and the food is decent quality.  Yes, it's a chain, and yes there is definitely better Mexican Food in the Valley, but it works for what it is; fast, tasty, reasonably priced, and decent service.  I had a burrito and it was HUGE!  I couldn't eat it all, and then I went off and left it sitting on the table.  Silly me.  Oh well.  Parking is usually easy to find and we were in and out in less than an hour.  I think I've found another \"Best Lunchtime Eats\" candidate here.
0 ||| The lady that runs this will certainly nickel and dime you, and rip you off as she did us !
2 ||| Adobo rice was just ok. No haupia and cash only gives this place three stars. Spam musubi was decent tho.
4 ||| This is the best Church in Las Vegas!  Praise and worship is awesome.  The present of the Lord is always here!
1 ||| So not worth it.  Front desk staff had an attitude.  Did not care we were part of the Best Western membership award program (not right tier I guess!). The room was so so and the staff did not make me want to feel better about it.\n\nI will give a bit of a shout out to the restaurant that is adjoining but not affiliated.  Nice staff and decent food,  (Sam in the bar is great).
3 ||| I have only had the pizza delivery from here, but damn, was it good.\nNot cheap, over $40 to feed four us, but well worth it.\nIt was hot, it tasted fresh, the ingredients were great.\nWe had the chicken alfredo pizza, which I was skeptical of. Alfredo has a tendency to be rich and over used. But it was a perfect balance. Absolutely wonderful.\nThe Queen Margherita pizza was awesome also. Again the ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the cheese was awesome (they use buffalo mozzarella).\nI say pizza is like sex. And this place is one helluva orgasm.
3 ||| Quick delivery and cannot stress enough to register for email deals because i never pay full price.  Savings up to 50% off regular price!
3 ||| Five star beer and four star food.  The uniqueness of a great brewery is overshadowed by a bar feel.  Some people come here and drink Miller and Corona beer from a bottle.  The Tempe location is better but a further distance for me.
4 ||| Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
4 ||| I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is amazing, take out or buffet. The waitress is very nice, and she knows my preferences. Try the seam chicken and lo mein, they're cooked just how I like it. The price is affordable, and your getting your money's worth. The restaurant is a little hard to find, it's a tiny little place. The parking lot is empty because there are mostly call-in orders.
0 ||| This location stinks. Service is ridiculous. Girl behind the counter kept asking about the tattoos my husband and I have. Rather unprofessional and pretty rude. I'm not a fan of people who try to make small talk with me in the hopes that we have something in common. This location was also dirty. Never again. I will stick with Subway.
1 ||| I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's, if you've eaten here through the years you know how much the food has changed; it's defiantly not like it use to be. I use to love heading to Applebee's for happy hour, but I'm not sure if this location gets that kind of business because the bar always seems to be slow. \n\nI'm a fan of the skinny margarita and honestly it's the only reason I ever want to put it out there for a resturant choice from time to time. The menu is pretty basic to me, nothing that sticks out so much anymore. There are so many other places that surpass what Applebee's is and it's too bad because in the 90's this was the spot. \n\nThis location is always inconsistent. Sometimes the food is meh and the waitstaff is also, and there have been times the experience has been good, so it's a hit and miss. I just cant give it more than 2 stars. The food just doesn't taste nearly as fresh and taken care of. It taste overly processed and standard. If this if like your favorite restaurant in the whole world (please venture out) than this experience may be expected or it may be sub par, this location produces, just-that
1 ||| If you're in the mood for a mediocre burrito as big as your leg, you're in the right place.
0 ||| What a poor initial visit!  Car was washed quick, but they left car in finishing area for 15 minutes before I gave up and took the unfinished car.  No apologizes and I was not alone, many others frustrated standing around.  Poor staffing!  Would not go back.
1 ||| Eh, I was hungry, nothing else was open at 3am.
3 ||| Never had a bad meal here, breakfast lunch or dinner.  Prices are very reasonable and the people are very welcoming.  One thing that needs improvement is the coffee.  I think they let the hot water wink at the grounds.  Way to weak.
3 ||| My family was in town, and my dad being a DDD fan, we had to try this place. It's in a residential area, so the drive there was a little strange, but that was soon replaced by great food. We got chicken, hot links, brisket and pulled pork with sides. The macaroni and cheese is the BOMB! I'm not a huge fan of bbq sauce, but I really liked the one they put on their meats. I had the hot link and it was delicious and spicy, but not too hot. The people that work there are fantastic and have great charisma and customer service. We visited the meat shop while were there and their products in there are just as good as their bbq outside. My husband and I will definitely return for more!
2 ||| Based on some recent reviews, it looks like the quality of food at Minutellos has slipped a little bit.  Still as I mentioned before, it's a Shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building.  \n\nAnyway, the main reason to come to Minutellos is for the pizza.  My cousin and I did just that the other night when we were in the area.  We did the whole 'Build Your Own Pizza' thing, ordering ours with pepperoni, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated.
4 ||| I thought Joyce did a fantastic job with my wedding dress.  It was significantly large when I brought it to her and it fit perfect when I picked it up.  I got more than one comment that it fit like a glove.  She was timely and friendly.
2 ||| Convenient to Convention Center, bagged lunch/counter service, if you're dining in head to somewhere else, maybe Chloe's nearby for good service and more flavor.  $14 for small tomato soup and large tuna salad from counter service is excessive, downtown pricing I suppose.  Couldn't even get hot sauce for my soup without paying extra (you can buy one of those tiny Tabasco bottles for $.69), the tuna salad caesar from Chloe's had a lot more flavor.\nThey do have free wireless and a decent amount of seating.
3 ||| For some reason I always crave for Pho when I'm away from home. I decided to come here after looking through yelp reviews for the most reviewed pho restaurants in China town. \n\nDefinitely 5 stars for cleanliness and promptness in their service for an Asian restaurant. This was probably the most clean Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Decor was modern and restaurant was big - great for big group gatherings or late night munching. They seemed fully staffed so whatever you asked for was done quickly. \n\nPho Kim Long serves many other dishes, both Vietnamese and Chinese food, so there's a lot to choose from. I ordered Beef Pho and was very satisfied with my selection. The beef slices were very tender! The portion of beef was generous in the size \"small\" bowl. I have to compliment them on their soup - I know every pho restaurant uses MSG but this place seemed to use it sparingly. I wasn't super thirsty after eating and did not have a problem slurping up the soup either =) \n\nThis will definitely be my go-to spot if I'm ever back to visit! Come hungry, leave satisfied...especially after a long night of partying =D \n\nHappy Eating yelpers!
1 ||| Food scaps, napkins, straw wrappings on the floor - and only about an hour into the business day on Sunday.  Not busy either, staff chatting with each other, so clearly there's no rush to clean things up from the Saturday night business.  They offer slices every day at lunch yet there were none ready (or in the oven) when I arrived.  Fresh pizza is nice, but when you go to a place for a slice, a major motivating reason is the short time it takes to heat up a slice rather than make a whole new pizza.  Looks like I'll be going to Ray's, Jo-Jo's, or Grimaldis now.
2 ||| Meh, if I'm feeling generous I'd give it another 1/2 star for the Italian wedding soup but my gnocchi and veal marsala were only worthy of a review to keep the exuberant reviews from getting out of hand.  I suppose I was expecting more out of Bloomfield, I would expect this service and quality outside of Little Italy.  I'd eat there again but it doesn't make me want to go back without trying other restaurants in the area.
0 ||| Slow, disorganized, and it felt like they were more interested in selling glasses, contacts and all the add-ons than the health of my eyes.\n\nI've worn glasses and contacts for 20+ years, and this experience was noticeably different.\n\nI'm sure the eye doctors are probably good...of my two hours in their office, I saw him for 5 minutes.  The rest of my time was spent in the waiting room, with an intern, and being up sold for all the add-ons around my contact and glasses (like a used car dealer selling you the sealer wax).\n\nPros:  solid selection of designer glasses, coffee while you wait in their lobby.\nCons: slow, disorganized, limited time with actual eye doctor, seemingly focused on sales volume and turning patients.\n\nYour mileage may vary, I have definitely come to expect more from my eye doctors and their staff.
3 ||| We got the #15 rare steak &brisket and an order of spring rolls and egg rolls and #14 rare steak\n\nThe pho is so tasty and they give you a pretty big portion\nMake sure to ask for the hot chili oil from the waiter, it's so tasty\n\nThe egg rolls were so good we had to do a 2nd order\n\nIf you're in Vegas then you should def stop by
2 ||| I was thrilled to find a place that does dosas in Madison. I was disappointed when my dosa was somehow dry and soggy at the same time. My dal was delicious. My dining companion's paneer dish was decent. The restaurant interior is gorgeous. I'd come back to try other options, including the Nepalese side of the menu.
2 ||| It's just your regular Filberto's but it's Julio's....\n\nIf you want the ultimate Filberto's/Julioberto's experience, hit up the Filberto's on Thomas St and Rural Road.  That place is awesome!  It's a nice restaurant experience with a kickass bar!  The people who work there are really what put it over the top.
2 ||| This is a trendy \"Brazilian Tapas\" restaurant nestled in the Cultural District. Perfect for grabbing a drink or light meal before or after a show.\n\nBoy and I popped into Bossa Nova before the ballet. We saw suits de-stressing from the week, some 30-something females looking to get tanked, and some were just like us, waiting to go to a show. \n\nI had an (uncharacteristically) girly cocktail. I was dressed to the nines for the ballet. I figured... why not? It was sugary sweet and through no fault of the very lovely bartender, I will stick to wine and beer from now on.  Boy chose one of their many scotch selections. \n\nFor tapas, I had the fig and goat cheese toastas. Boy chose the stuffed peppers. Strangely, my food arrived about fifteen minutes before the peppers. The restaurant was not crowded in the slghtest, so I found this puzzling. Having tried both, I thought the tapas were bland and overpriced for things I could have easily made at home. Boy disagreed. He really liked his peppered. \n\nThe quality of the food and drinks (and their corresponding high prices) probably merit a two-star review. But we were greated by a very pleasant hostess and served well by the nice bartender. Their service alone probably earns Bossa Nova the three stars I am giving.
1 ||| Ordered pepper steak,  sweet & sour pork,  pork fried rice & egg rolls. Now I have to tell you that I have been ordering from this place for over 10 years and this time I was very disappointed.  The egg rolls were very greasy, and the pepper steak was tasteless. Even the fried rice was not up to standard. The only thing I can say is every time I order it is as if they have a different  cook.  I was really looking forward to having Chinese food and was so bummed out that the food was not their usual fare.
1 ||| No way. People putting 4 stars or better. I plain think they are crazy or don't know what good pizza is. FAR too expensive for what you get. Very sparce on the ingriedient side. I just felt ripped. And nothing special on the taste either. I mean, it was ok, but that's it.
3 ||| Went here last week with 6 guys from out of town. A short ten dollar ride from the strip we had a great meal with great food and lots of imported beer. Total bill for 6 was 140.00.  The cost of an ordinary meal on the strip. Take a chance and wander here.  It will be worth it   The magic moment
0 ||| Waited over 30 minutes for our food. Was it worth it? Nope. Food didn't have any taste I had to season myself.  I don't think I wanna come back again. Poor server was really nice. But What's up with the kitchen? What a shame.
0 ||| They were 25 minutes late. I called and was told they were only 5 minutes away.  Ten minutes late I called and told they would be there in 5 minutes.  Would not recommend.
0 ||| Be ware things are not so warm and fuzzy anymore.  I tried in vain to book an ticket, tried to use rapid rewards, then tried to buy the ticket, then called.  The call center acknowledged that the system was down and there was nothing they would or could do just call back the next day when the fairs jumped up another tier.  We had everything loaded, rate was locked in credit car was logged in and whamo we were cut off.  Naturally I called and got a supervisor's supervisor, Omar, I believe and he callously blew me off and eventually hung up......Oh and did I mention this was the only direct flight left, not quite the Keller era anymore.
0 ||| Wow, what an absolute shame.  This place has an amazing menu and the food looks delicious, but the service is so bad you may never get to eat.  I never give folks a hard time and try to be as patient as possible, but trying to have breakfast here is painfull.  There is no organization and you don't know wether to seat yourself or talk to the wait staff.  We wandered to a two top and sat down.  When the waitress finally approached us we told her we had never eaten there and asked for a recomendation.  she just stared at us blankley and said she didn't know.  She left us to go get drinks (1 coffee, 1 oj and 1 water that were never refilled or even offered). We ordered and after a wait the wrong order came to the table.  The place is very small with a small patio and there were three wait staff running the front of the house, but they all seemed more concerned with arguing about who was doing what then helping the customers.  In the hour and a half it took to get through breakfast more then 30 people came to the door to try to be seated and were not talked to at all.  when people around us finally were able to pay and leave their tables remained dirty and unseated while a line formed at the door.  This place would be amazing if it had a better staff or a manager to help run the front of the house.  Sorry guys, not coming back.
2 ||| This is my to-go grocery store. I've come to like it more than the Wal-Mart that is near by. It has better meats, vegetables, and fruits to choose from. I have the rewards card so most of the foods I buy are marked down which is helpful. I do recommend everyone get a card when they shop here because I bought meats that were up to 26$ and with the rewards card it can mark down to as much as 12$! I don't know about you but that's a steal!\n\nI wouldn't buy alcohol here though, it's kind of on the pricey side. Although my favorite Moscato is only 7$! \n\nThe staff aren't really that helpful, it's pretty much a hit or miss. But it's pretty clean & organized and it gets the job done!
4 ||| I told some friends that I was going to take them for a Gelato experience to rival Italy (I've been, I know).  We drove from Central Phoenix, and the whole ride was consumed with them giving me a hard time about how far it was and how long it was taking.  When we pulled up, one of them said \"I seriously doubt something named ANGEL SWEET is going to be the best gelato experience of my life!\"  About 3 bites in she was changing her tune and has asked to go back no less than 4 times.  \n\nThe proof is in the pudding (or rather gelato) here folks.  The flavors are consistently good, the gelato is made fresh daily in stores and the combo possibilities are endless.  \n\nAllergen info: Unlike the yogurt places on every corner, Angel Sweet has lots of dairy free options.  All their fruit flavors (with the exception of coconut) are dairy-free and taste fantastic.  If you are avoiding dairy, this is the dessert spot for you!  You will not be sorry you went.
4 ||| We have been here a few times. Liberty is awesome! They always treat you very kindly and do all they can to help people. I won't go anywhere else. \n\nLiberty, thanks for being there!
2 ||| This is a fairly standard Home Depot, with almost nothing to single it out from the others around town, except that they are a bit more challenging to get to than most others, simply because of their location.\n\nNot only is the traffic a bit worse because of the 485/51 intersection, but then you have to take this strange loop around the shopping center and finally you get to Home Depot at the end of the road - the last store on the left, as it were.\n\nOnce you get there, everything is just about the same as all the others, and the staff is nice enough, so there are no real surprises to be found. I have had neither bad nor particularly good experiences in this particular location, since we do not get to this side of the city all that often.
2 ||| It's not the greatest Target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needs.\n\nIf you're looking for produce, lower prices, and bigger selection in every department then head to the Target in East Liberty.
4 ||| If you're looking for a great corner dive with interesting folks, witty bartenders, decent bar food, cheap drinks, low drama, and weekly sex trivia, you found it.
4 ||| This review is a bit late in coming since I haven't eaten there since 1999, but this is what I wrote back then:  Is this the best Italian place in town?  I don't know - I always get one of the fish specials - it's definitely the best place in town to get fish.  Portions are small, especially for an Italian place, which makes it a better \"date\" place - you don't have to worry about getting bloated.  You will even have room left to gourmandize one of their great desserts with your date.
3 ||| I would consider myself the burger connoisseur.  I would say the rare burger with mushrooms and raw onions at Tessaro's was definitely one of my best burger experiences.  The meat had a nice flavor and the bun was not \"bready\".  Two signs of a great burger and  the rest is just fluff.   The only reason I won't give this placet 5 stars is the bartender was not friendly...AT ALL!  Our waitress on the other hand made up for it.
3 ||| Had a satisfying breakfast here with a friend. The French toast was perfectly cooked, and my friend's strawberry waffles were excellent. Service was friendly, and we had a coupon for BOGO, which made our meal very reasonable. \n\nThe clientele here does seem to be quite a bit older though. The combined age of both me and my friend was still younger than most of the patrons here!
0 ||| Despite apprehensions of the 1st review here I decided to try this place for somewhere different after talking to a Co-Worker about this place.\n\n Upon entering, the atmosphere was nothing like the China Star on Maryland and not very inviting at all. I cant put a finger on it exactly and am in no mood to disect it at this time.\n\nAs usual, I arrived around 3pm still making it for lunch. The kitchen is visible through open glass & while I didnt inspect it or pay much attention to it, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. However, when I went to get some sushi, which is adjacent to the kitchen, the girl making it was giving me this look. I just looked back at her and said \"DAMAGE INCORPORATED\" taking a big plate of rolls. The \"seafood salad\" that I accompay my sushi with looked like it was opened from its container and placed in the bowl = no mayo and no attempt at all to cut it up or add ingredients to it. In hindsight THIS sets off some alarm bells for me.\n\nThe sushi was nothing special and the wasabi had a soup-like consistency to it. In addition to this, they offer your normal chinese fare and the stand out was the Coconut Chicken which instead of being all batter was \"all chicken\" in a light to medium batter and very good. The spicy chicken was just plain weird = orange, dry & not spicey at all. Everything else seemed normal and standard.\n\n As far as the service goes, they seemed freindly enough & I realize I get to these places when the help is having thier lunch and they have to eat too, but I still had to get up and ask for a water refill and that is NBD to me at all under the circumstances.\n\nOverall it was what it is for the &6.50 price & that would have been the end of it and I wish it was. I would have done this review ending it here saying: \"It was ok but I wont go out of my way to return there as there are way better places as far as quality and more offerings like shrimp etc. for the same price\" and given it  2 stars.\n\nBut THAT wasnt the end of it as something followed me home and \"sat\" on my stomach giving me a queezy feeling all night. Then in the morning I woke with a fever and not feeling good at all and after trying to swallow a sip of my morning coffee began to puke my guts out. I was GLAD to get whatever it was that was making me sick out of my body!! I barely made it into work and the whole day I was lethargic and C0-workers could tell I was under the weather and not my normal self (which they all probably enjoyed!! LOL). I didnt eat anything until late in the day & it was a small yogurt and forced at that.\n\nMy guess is that somewhere along the line, as presented with the seafood salad, someone cut corners and compromised some raw food or something. All I can say is based on my own experience is \"BEWARE eating at this place\". I'm writing this 2 days after the fact & I still have no appitite due to the above outlined experience.\n\nIf anything positive I can take away from this and pass on to the reader is:\n\n STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW & DONT BE SO ADVENTUROUS!!\" uhhhhh ............word to the wise
2 ||| I only love this place for getting together on lazy sundays with my girls! Im NOT crazy about the atmosphere nor counter service.. The breakfast/brunch choices are good..Im always into the poached eggs with proscuitto on english muffin.. we always get coffee and chase it with a bottle of good wine! WHICH, you can buy in the store and they will open / cork it for you.. but NOT serve you...which is fine! Ive had the Sonoma Salad.. Im not into that its in the refrigerator there as 'premade'.. but good for the grab/go.. Im just into 'fresh built'.. :-)
0 ||| The store manager is a positively horrid woman. Behaves like she's never worked a second of customer service in her life. And their management seems to mistreat the employees terribly. They all look overworked and miserable. Nothing is ever in stock there, and the store is just generally dirty and disorganized. Don't shop here, trust me.
2 ||| Seems to always be cycling out old places and in the new.  Hard to keep up, but at least there are always options..
0 ||| I have been to the Fireside a few times because they do have okay food, but my past several experiences have gone from bad to worse. First, I ordered wings and an appetizer from there for pickup. We were told 30 minutes, and my boyfriend headed over in 30 minutes only to get there and wait an additional 30 minutes. Obviously they never put the order in, but of course not only did they not admit that, but they also never apologized or offered any extras for our inconvenience of waiting twice what they promised. \n\nSo still, we decided to give them another chance. Their wing nights are Tuesdays and Wednesdays offering $.30 wings. We double checked the website for the special to  make sure we had the right day and price before we left the house. As we arrive and sit down there is a piece of paper at the end of our table stating Wednesday wings are $.50 (Almost double what they used to be).  When the waitress finally comes over I ask and SHOW HER that the website says wings are $.30 today. She says, \"Oh that needs changed. They're not. They're $.50\".  No, \"I'm sorry\" because that's their motto, and no offering to honor the special stated on the website since that's what drew us in to begin with. We immediately got up in left. \n\nMy recommendation is to drive the extra 1/8 mile down the road to MUGSHOTS in the shopping center. Better environment, good food, BETTER PRICES by a mile, and better service. You walk into the Fireside and everyone just stares at you like you don't belong because you aren't in there 6 days a week, and the staff is completely miserable
1 ||| Good chill spot after a game. Old school music videos in the background where it makes you reminisce of the good old days. Crowd vary in age and are there for a fun time. Drinks are cheap.\n\nHere's the downfall. Food didn't look appetizing. Generic food that looks as if it came from a frozen box and was heated in a microwave. Wouldn't be surprised. I would stay away from there drink specials. It may be cheap but thats because there's no alcohol! My friend ordered a blue hurricane for $4 but asked for a shot for it since there was no hint of alcohol whatsoever. With the shot it came out to $12. So much for drink specials. They ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better. Fail. Sad to say but they returned it. Stick with beer. You can't go wrong with the flavor and amount of alcohol in it
2 ||| At Poncho's you will find good Mexican food, but there is always a weird musty smell that I can't get over.  If you do go, I reccomend the frozen margaritas.  They are poured straight out of a machine, but they are delicious.
0 ||| Christmas is suppose to be a happy time.  Well, apparently US AIRWAYS has not been informed.  Snow is a frequent occurence in the Northeast, so why was the Philadelphia airport such a mess last week during the snow storm which left me stranded for several days?  The answer:  inefficient, mismanaged, uncooperative, untrained US Airway employees!  What a mess.  Why should it take over 2 hours for an employee to put a baggage tag on a suitcase?  The game USAIRWAYS plays is\" pass the buck\"..no one knows the answer to anything!  Children and mothers were crying!  People were as patient as possible, but USAIRWAYS was negligent and nasty!  After telling everyone that all planes were overbooked, I was lucky (because I was persistent) to get on an evening flight to Phoenix, only to count TWENTY TWO empty seats, leaving thousands of people stranded in Philadelphia.  And, the planes are old and dirty!  Service is poor.  Attitude is a disgrace...to the USA and travelers from abroad.  USAIRWAYS should either revamp their operations, or get out of the business.  I predict a major airplane crash if the cockpit is as inefficient as the employees at ticketing.  My advice: DO NOT FLY USAIRWAYS!!!  We should not support such poor service.
2 ||| This airport has rocking chairs in it which is fitting since the people here love to do things like stand on the moving sidewalk.  The moving sidewalk is not to take a little break from your day of walking.  It's to help people get to their gates faster.  \n\nCharlotte has been my connecting airport several times and I've never missed a flight.  Considering the amount of people standing around as if the rapture is about to happen - it's amazing I've never missed a flight here.  The good news is this airport is clean... and there was an attendant in the bathroom.
2 ||| I've only had a problem once here.  I know that's not the best line to start with for a Yelp review, but in contrast to other reviews, I guess I'm pretty lucky?? I had a custom order concerning six tacos and they forgot to change up two of the tacos.  Good thing I caught it only a few miles down the street.  I brought the order back, went to the staff and informed them of the error, and they promptly corrected it.  Plus, they let me keep the \"mistakes\" and I gave it away to someone else.\n\nStaff is usually pretty nice and accommodating.  Food isn't that great but what do you expect from a fast food joint? Overall, not too bad in my book.
2 ||| Stayed here at a Tower Room for New Years. Stayed here for 2.5 days and mainly used it to pass out in. Once you get past the cigarette smell in the main lobby, you're pretty good to go. And you do get what you pay for, for those customers complaining about the smoke. It is a little troublesome in terms of traveling to the strip since this hotel is off the strip. There is a shuttle that runs from the hotel to the main strip, but since we were there for New Years and the main strip is closed down the night of New Years Eve, it was pretty frustrating trying to get on the strip. We were able to get a cab from our hotel to a street near the strip and we walked the rest of the way. \n\nThe hotel room and bed was clean. Bathroom was also nice. It's a good place to stay to save some money.
3 ||| Went here before the regatta yesterday, was my third time here...consistently great, best gyros around!! Thanks.
0 ||| We decided to stop by this place, since we were in the area. We ordered take-out, after noticing that we had time, we decided to sit down and eat. But the histess infront of the rest of the rest of the dine in customers informed us we had to leave because we ordered tae-out. The tables were for dine-in customers only. So we decided to leave and because if the way she handled thr situation, we decided to leave and ask for a refund. The cashiers gave us the managers number, (he was not in at the moment), he asked us to wait for him. The way we were treated, we just wanted to get out of there. So he called the store so they could give us a cash refund, instead of charging back to our card. I ran back in and spoke to the cashier, he asked if I had the ice tea, &; he needed it back!!! So I ran to the parking garage to get the ice tea! Horrible cystomer service!!!
0 ||| I'm giving one star, take into consideration that I am a vegan.\nI go to Vegas quite often and once in a while we'll stop to eat here.\nIt's usually PACKED.\nMost of the time I come in a big group though so we know we have to wait.\nI don't think they have ONE vegan item besides the white rice.\nI tried to order the spicy eggplant with out the pork?\nIt was hard to communicated with the sever, he didn't speak English well.\nNone of the servers do.\nWhen the food came out, there were little pieces of pork in it.\nI don't like to be a nuisance to anyone so I just gave it to my friends.\n\nI guess if you're into BBQ'd duck and stuff, this is the place for you!
3 ||| This place is delicious! It's simple breakfast food at a reasonable price!   Just went and got the double that I shared with my son because it's a lot if food and my husband ordered the triple!  Triple everything, eggs, meat, potatoes! Our whole meal with two coffees was $19.60! You can't beat that!  We have never had lunch but I'm Sure it's tasty as well!!! There is one worker that has been there for years (I assume he's the manager) and he is super friendly and always accommodating! The service is superior and the place is clean and very friendly! Go now what are you waiting for!
0 ||| Had a few people my roomie works with reccomend this place since we celebrate burrito Tuesday every week. We were both appalled by the taste and setup. The best explanation we could come up with was a Goodwill version of Taco Bell. Obviously a lot of people really enjoy it, but it is definitely one Mexican restaurant we will never think about eating at again. If there's a Cafe Rumba or Revo burrito in your area, hit either of those instead. They will knock your socks off!
2 ||| What... Is this place 15 bucks to get into these days? Great place to see a movie, but I have been there a few times when the feature was sold out an hour before showtime. Buy the \"Souvenir Cup\" and get refills for only a dollar! I like the popcorn sprinkles too.
4 ||| You have to get here early and careful they close when they run out of donuts. This is a great spot for freshly made donuts. The prices are great and the breakfast sandwiches are good also.\n  I was a regular at D.D. in FL until they shrunk the portion sizes... Like we wouldn't notice Mr.Dunkin? Anyhow a huge tiger tail aka. Bow Tie or a giant Bear Claw for only $1.69, you can't beat it. \n  I've been a regular here for about a month, the only down side is if you go around noon your selection shrinks considerably. And don't expect them to be open by three. Enjoy your donuts, but if you start going to often you may have to renew your gym membership!
2 ||| Sooo .. why is this place so popular and over hyped? Maybe I'm a bit biased. I'm not really a tapas person but I do like Japanese food. My friends and I were in a group of 5 and we decided to come on a Saturday night. The wait actually wasn't bad, we went around 8:00PM? And we were seating in maybe 20 minutes? \n\nNow, when I went there, I was surprised at how packed it was. There were a lot of people, which is a very good sign. It must mean their food is fan-fucking-tabulous, right?! RIGHT! They gave us a menu, but why do they even need to spend money on menus? They have menus all over the wall. I wish I had done more research cause then I would've brought my glasses with me. \n\nOh, no, they don't a set of menus that repeat on the walls. Everything that they paste on the walls are completely different. To my right, behind me, and in front of me were all different items. Too bad I can't read any of the ones that were in front of me. I was sitting in their \"fake\" tatami mat style tables so facing me was the bar, and on top of the bar was where half of their menu was posted. I fully realize that this is not uncommon but squinting is not how I want to begin my night even though I'm Asian. \n\nAnyways, between my friends and I, we ordered the following:\n\nTataki: Almost rare beef slices that were seared. It had good flavor. Though, I could do without the ponzu sauce. Not bad.\n\nYellowtail Tartar: Pretty good. Though it can get kinda messy once you start eating it. Not bad.\n\nJalapeno Fried Rice: Has potential to be better. It didn't have much flavor. Also, I think it's because when I think jalapeno, I think spicy and this dish was not spicy at all. I even ate the slices of jalapeno and .. well, nothing happened. They actually had a spoonful of siracha on the the rice for you to mix it in with but ... uhm, why? Shouldn't jalapeno be enough? Though this does give me an idea to try to make this dish at home ;)\n\nGarlic Chicken Gizzards: Possibly the best dish I had at this establishment. Though I'm not sure bugger sized pieces quenches my .. cravings for it. But it has great flavor to it. Thumbs up.\n\nKimchi Fried Rice: Nothing really spectacular about it.\n\nButtered Clams: Uh .. I think I prefer a black bean sauce to go with my sauteed clams versus this. It wasn't that eye opening. It was just like, \"Oh so this is it.\"\n\nBeef Tongue Skewers: It took them a while to get this out to us. It was good though. Nice and tender ... however, the other skewer that my friend had -- she said it wasn't that tender. It was actually tough for her. So .. inconsistent quality. \n\nGrilled Whole Squid: So, they actually forgot about this item. They forgot to input this order. When all the other foods were finished, we all just sat there waiting for this dish -- which took FOREVER to get out. It wasn't good either. It was kind of fried on certain ends. We're not so sure their fire on their grill is quite balanced. \n\nI had wanted to try their honey toast but one of my friends said it was nothing special and over hyped. I trusted his judgement and decided not to bother. \n\nSO. It's average. It did not tickle my taste buds. Sorries.
4 ||| Best curry ever. Try the massaman
3 ||| You want Mexican foodstuffs?  Get thee in here.  Shelves groaning with everything from nopalitos to refried beans...produce, not great but usually good and inexpensive.  And MEAT...yes, the carnivore in you can come out.
0 ||| We have been vomiting all night after eating here. Went in to talk to someone about it and they obviously don't care. Guy said oh well i didn't work last night. Looks like they have decent reviews, but i wouldn't take my chance again
2 ||| We really liked the pub feel of this place and the location hidden among the houses. It could be easy to miss if you didn't know it was there. The inside didn't feel like a house at all, it was pretty dark inside, yet light enough to read the menu and socialize. The service was great, prompt refills, although we did wait an extended period of time to get our check. \ni had the buffalo chicken sandwich and Cajun fries. Wasn't a big fan of the buffalo chicken. i guess i prefer more sauce and flavor. It seemed like too much chicken and bun, with not enough flavor. i liked the Cajun fries for my side and they were a generously sized portion.\n\nWe also tried the nachos. My special lady friend gave them a thumbs up. They were flour tortilla chips which seemed odd at first, but in the end seemed like a good choice. \n\ni'd like to go back another time when i can enjoy some drinks and try another menu selection.
3 ||| As a proud owner and overhauled of a 1951 Ranch home, I'm a connoisseur of hardware stores in the same way a social media fan is a connoisseur of coffee houses.\n\nAs my local hardware store, Walt's is my go to place for my home reno needs.  Sure, I still shop at the big box stores for materials, etc,.  But Walt's can't be beat for those last minute items you forgot you needed, ran out of, or broke.  As well, it's small but well stocked shop is much easier to navigate, and the staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and able to make recommendations about what you need.  Moreover as they are located in a mid century neighborhood, they are familiar with the challenges of dealing with older houses in a way that a lot of the staff in big box stores simply aren't.\n\nSo if you are tired of the soulless big box experience, give Walt's a  try next time you need to do something around your home. You won't be disappointed.
1 ||| This place seems to want to get rich off being featured on Food Network.  There's a big banner out front now and there are pictures all over the place of the owner (i'm guessing) and Guy.  Anyway, this is why I decided to try the place at all so maybe it worked.\n\nMy friend ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and I went with the Linguine with Red Clam sauce.  Its a very tiny place with plastic patio chairs.  We waited for about 20 min so we had time to check out the decor.  \n\nThe prices are crazy!  They charge as much as a full Italian restaurant does - I've never seen a diner, drive thru or a dive that charges so much per plate!  Skimming the menu, I'd say the average entree is about 12, appetizer is 8, desert is 5.  \n\nSo by the time we got our food we were starving, but we managed to drive home which was about 5 min away.  They gave me a few pieces of bread for my pasta which was very good (and very surprising because bread is on the menu for like $5).  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was WAAAY salty.  The portion wasn't what I expected for the price I paid at a \"dive\".  The sandwich was a little better, but nothing special.  I work at a hospital and I'd say their chicken parmigian is better.\n\nAll in all, this wasn't the best experience.  I say if they want to charge so much, open an actual restaurant.  Then maybe they can serve some liquor instead of just having pictures of wine bottles everywhere and empty vodka bottles holding flowers.  (Its BYOB, $5 corkage fee).  I'm very disappointed in Food Network.  :\\
3 ||| The only reason I like this Salon is because I've finally found a stylist that cuts my hair okay, Kara. I used to go to one of those grandma salons that only old women go to and cuts your hair for cheap (I even got a discount for being a student).  However, since it closed down, I hadn't been able to get a decent haircut in Pittsburgh (I've had to wait to go back to California to cut my hair).  I've actually tried this salon prior to getting Kara and I left very unhappy (my hair looked like it hadn't been cut at all and I had to pay $50+ for it).  However, I decided to give MCN another try and get an appointment with Kara based on other Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed.  She didn't require a lot of instructions regarding what I want and she cut my hair just the way I wanted it, even better.  I love her!
4 ||| Aww Damn! This place....how did this one get by me for so long. The food here is fantastic portions are huge and service is wonderful. Had the beef and teriyaki chicken combo and it was ..... There has to be a better word than delicious it was superb. Live on west side and this is one trip that's worth the drive. Definitely one of my new favorites, it's refreshing to see a mom and pop business succeed..... Awww Damn!
1 ||| OK, so this wasn't exactly a gourmet experience, but I just needed to have some pancakes. This restaurant is a Northwest chain that has expanded through much of the U.S. I got bacon pancakes (i.e., bacon inside the pancakes) and a side order of sausage patties. The pancakes were heavy, the sausage not bad.\n\nToo bad I didn't check here first - perhaps the house specialties (apple pancake or Dutch baby) are the way to go.
1 ||| It's pretty ballsy to think you can get away with only serving your own beer. ...especially considering they're not all that great.
4 ||| Ok, apparently I'm the one breaking ranks here.\n\nAfter I bought my house, I had a housewarming party and I bought a cake from Tammie Coe. It was 50 bucks and people said I was crazy for spending that kind of money on a cake. That was almost 2 years ago, and people still remember how awesome freaking good that cake was. My grandma sat on the back patio with a slice, a glass of wine and a cigarette and looked like she had died and gone to heaven. I don't remember if this location is like a caf\u00e9. I don't think so. But she has a location on Roosevelt and 7th St. in downtown Phoenix and that one I believe does. All great cities need great desert shops, and Phoenix has one of the best.
0 ||| I was just at this place a couple hours ago and service was TERRIBLE! I've gone to this restaurant and all those times we were able to do split checks and today they said they have never done spilt checks.\n\nThe guy charges my card without my consent and I see he charged me the whole bill when i asked him I was only going to pay for certain entrees and he said that it is IMPOSSIBLE to do my request. So I tell him to VOID the transaction and so my other friend comes to pay for it and we just all give her cash. I come home to check my bank statement and see that THEY HAVE BILLED ME FOR THE MEAL AS WELL! Im going to wait a few days to see if he really did void my transaction, but this is ridiculous! Usually when I void my order it shows in my bank statement right away.\n\nSo if you're coming in a big group, make sure everyone has cash because this place does not accept split checks! Better yet go elsewhere!\n\nFood quality is mehhh as well. Usually I LOVE pho and can eat the whole bowl but it just did not satisfy me as much as other restaurants. I will never come back to this place again. \n\nI will though if they don't give me my money back!! So frustrating!!!
1 ||| As far as restaurant reviews I go I'm pretty easy going.  I hardly ever rate less than a 3, but this restaurant probably deserves a one.  The only thing keeping it from a one is the fact that it was clean.  We called for a reservation in which we were told that they didn't take reservations for two.  When we got there, tons of spacious 4 seater tables were available but they stuck us back in a two seater wedged literally a food between two other tables.  When we asked to be moved they indicated that they had a lot of four person reservations but if the tables were open after a few minutes we could move.  We were never offered those other tables which stayed open the entire 90 minutes we were there.  Then when the couple next to us left we asked again to move one table over.  They indicated that it was reserved and we could not move.  Again two people were seated at the table.  Not sure how that happened since they said policy indicated that they didn't take two person reservations.  \n\nSo if seating doesn't bother you and you've rolled your eyes and skipped over the top section let me discuss the below par food.  We ordered the chicken cordon blue.  Let's just say that if I closed my eyes and took a bite of chicken mcnugget and one of arrivederci's chicken cordon blue bites I would not know which was which.  My vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions.  To top it off my \"famous\" crab cake was more mayonnaise than anything else.  However, my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells.  \n\nThe experience and food we got was not worth the 70 dollars we paid and I will never come back here again.
4 ||| I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I always come here on rainy days and hangover nights. They are open late and the service is really quick! The deep friend spring rolls are bomb!
0 ||| What a crock. Dr. Rojas made me feel like i had cancer. I found out later that she made many others feel this way in order to get bi-weekly ultra sounds. When i got my second opinion by Dr. Glassman, who told me that there was nothing wrong with me, i knew that the Rojas was a swindler. Don't waste your money, or your deductible. They want your money and will tell you anything to get it.
2 ||| Domino's Pizza is A-OK !\n\nI go to this Domino's about once or twice a year especially since they came out with their pan pizza's which are so yummy and at a decent price.  Medium pan pizza and two toppings only $7.99.\n\nDomino's is not the best pizza as we have our favorite pizza spot but from time to time we love to have a slice of Domino's pizza and the stuffed cheese bread.\n\nGreat prices.  Great location.  Domino's is A-OK.
2 ||| Overpriced and dirty. Never had any good memories from this place.
0 ||| This facility is by far the absolute worst family practice ever!!!! I would avoid this place at all costs. There has been 2 Dr.'s that have even decided to leave and practice elsewhere because of how poorly this facility is ran. The remaining Dr.'s absolutely suck right along with the administration as well! I was there with my wife and daughter just for a referral to a dermatologist for our daughter and the Dr. ended up calling my wife stupid all because she called a P. A. a Dr. Half the time their staff doesn't even know what's going on there either. We finally had enough with this facility when we called to schedule an appointment for one of our children to be seen and they told me that the Dr. was no longer seeing children. RIDICULOUS!! this is a FAMILY PRACTICE!!! (so i thought!) I then called administration and the director and the Dr. denied that! They are absolutely ridiculous there and incompetent with doing there job! We unfortunately were patients there far too long! ( No longer! ) AVOID!!!!!
3 ||| Another reason that I love the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is because I can always get through the security in record speed. I have never waited longer than 10 minutes and that is pretty amazing.
0 ||| Just under $9.00 for a combo #2 Pork Burrito, rice & beans with a medium Melon drink.  The Burrito was dry, meat greasy, beans runny and only a few spoonfulls of pico de gallo in the condiment tray.  No Salsa verde or any red sauce at all.  Staff was surly and made me feel like I bothered them to eat there.\n\nWhy didn't I read the Yelp reviews before stopping in ...
4 ||| This place has every nut , bolt and screw you will ever need! staff is helpful and attentive!!!
0 ||| Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something??? In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore.
3 ||| This place is pretty special...although, it's in a sketchier part of town.  And since it's in an old house, it's a little intimidating to approach...and even when you walk in, you are smack-dab in the middle of the very small kitchen.  But...oh the smells that come from that kitchen!  Pure Hungarian Heaven!!  The dining room is a little on the crammed side and if you have a large group, expect to be bumping elbows...but, since it's all family-style, you are getting cozy anyway.  \n\nThe food is extremely authentic and Alex makes you feel like you are just part of the family.  I love that the menu changes with the season and that he just cooks what he wants and you eat it or you don't...but trust me...you will want to eat it!!!!  \n\nIf you are expecting a romantic fine-dining experience here...you will be disappointed. There is no sliverware (plastic is what you get)..but, you will likely become fast friends with people at other tables since everyone is in such a happy place whiel they are there.  \n\nGo with an open mind...you will enjoy it!
0 ||| A few months ago I wrote a very positive review of this place.  Starting about in September, however, something very odd and unpleasant happened to Cheuvront.  The lunch service became slow, to the point where I thought I'd been forgotten.  Worse, the food started to change in unpleasant ways.  Gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings.  Suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices.\n\nSpecifically, I'm talking about the lunch pizzas I had for lunch at Cheuvront so many times before.  Last time I went, a few weeks ago, I suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary.  Today, there was four times the cheese, at least two or three times the sauce, along with chunks of nearly raw garlic.\n\nWorse, the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed, showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me.\n\nI was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at Cheuvront today.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant, but at least the lunch service is a total loss.
2 ||| Popped in on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a good variety of Chinese dishes and a large number of seafood dishes (multiple shrimp dishes, fish, squid, fake lobster dish) was surprised to see pizza and kielbasa on the choices as well. The banner says Lunch is $5.99 on the outside, for the buffet so I decided to try it. \nI have had better buffets and better Chinese food but it was OK. The price I later learned does not include your drink, which I think in all fairness it should. They have a few deserts and soft serve ice cream but I passed on the sweets. My favorite was the fried butterfly shrimp, they were tender, meaty and tasty - had 5 of them. The chow mien was a little greasy but still tasty. Sampled some chicken dish that was also tasty but since nothing is labeled to tell you what it is called it's hard to know. \n\nAlso thought the take out food situation was weird, they give you a Styrofoam clam shell thing, you fill it yourself with whatever and then you pay something like $3.65 a pound for your order. WTF, is with that? I'll pass on that. \n\nThe staff is attentive. The place from what I saw was was clean. There were a few TVs in the place to watch, but one was a little to loud over the others but not to annoying. \n\nIt's an okay buffet, but I have been to better and not paid much more, for better quality and bigger variety with the drink included. Doubt if I'll return with so many Chinese buffets to still choose from.
1 ||| Great location and staff, average to below average rooms. I think it was clean?
2 ||| Red Rocks has something for everyone. And generally under the name of someone you know. Seriously. I know quite a few people whose names are on the menu.\n\nAs for the food, it's fine. I've never been WOWed....except for the size of the desserts that are presented after the meal. Dang, that's some big cake. Plenty of vegetarian-friendly options, and for the carnivorous, there's the obscene Tom's Pittsburgh Salad, topped with London broil and fries.\n\nIt's a popular spot for folks a generation (or two) older than myself, and I can see why. Chili's wishes it were the staple that Red Rocks is for the Strawberry Hill area.\n\nService is fine, not overbearing...and they can tell that if you're coming in for lunch (or dinner, for that matter), you're not in a great hurry. \n\nOh, and right now, they have a Yelp check-in deal for 10% off your meal. That's definitely in their favor.\n\nRed Rocks is often a choice for people working in my office or living in the vicinity, so I end up there more often than I'd rather. All in all, it doesn't disappoint.
3 ||| 4 out of 5 because I don't love the chips & salsa. A little bland for me. But.. Cabo is one of my faves in Charlotte. I love the fun loud atmosphere, you feel like you are in Cali. I always order the barbecue mahi mahi tacos. A little sweet a little savory, the texture of the fish is perfect & I love how the sauce brings it all together. So delicious. You have to try to jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes. They are awesome! Not too spicy, you just get little kicks in every bite. I love this place & always brig people here.
2 ||| I started out really disliking the food at Silky's...especially where there are better 'bar food' options within a mile.  \n\nBut, they've won me over.  A little bit.  I'll call them average.\n\nWings - still underwhelmed.  They are a dry rub (unless you get a bbq).  And usually overcooked.  I like my wings well done, but these are always so average - I don't even order them here anymore.\n\nBurgers and Sandwiches are pretty good.  Buffalo chicken wrap was solid.  Burger (off the special menu) got the job done.\n\nWaffle fries - very good.  I think because they are very crispy.  Based on the bacon reviews below - i think the general rule is they are good at frying the hell out of something...sometimes for good - sometimes for bad.\n\nWhat redeems this place beyond the average food - is the layout and outdoor seating.  It beats other bloomfield bars given it's greater amount of seating and better views of tv screens.  Also, it has the most outdoor seating.  Not tons - but if you get there at a decent hour - still possible to get a table.\n\nSilky's usually makes the list to watch a game or if weather calls for outdoor drinking.
4 ||| Great job! They honored a $15 coupon from the internet and they work Sunday. I'll be back!
2 ||| The steak was dry.\nAnd the teriyaki didn't help much in that department.\n\nI love rice bowl restaurants... and I'm always sad when one disappoints. I'm sure it has its awesome days and awful days and I may have just ended up arriving on one of their bad days - but first impressions were awful for me. It looked very promising, and it LOOKS like the quality of the food is great... and the food got served so quickly... it seemed really promising.\nBut the food wasn't really worth its price... I could tolerate the dry-er rice as I love almost all kinds of rice... but not doing so good with the steak? Don restaurants often live and die by their beef-bowls, and this one would certainly die even if you just put an average Yoshinoya next to it (and that's even considering Yoshinoya's current bad quality beef).\n\nI wonder if this place just gets high ratings just because it's the only one of its kind (as in: not mostly sushi) for miles...\nI WANT it to be good. I really do. And with the high praise others give it: I'm sure it is, in its own way, at its own time. But in a competitive sense: I'd imagine it'd disappear quickly if it had to compete. 4 stars for its promise, 2 stars removed for not delivering, +1 star just to give them the benefit of the doubt.
0 ||| Let me start by saying that I don't like an over abundance of seasonings in my food. There must always be a balance between base and spice and the smaller the number of base ingredients, the more precarious that balance becomes. My preference is in direct contrast to my mother, since she LOVES a lot of the typical Italian American spices in abundance. I am not my mother.\n\nUpon entering Aiello's, one can see the typical decor of this pizza parlor. Everything is plastic, white, and sterile and I'm direct contrast to the warm, wooden interiors of Mineo's. I put in our dinner order at the counter:\n\nItalian Wedding Soup\nSmall Pizza With Pepperoni\nSmall Stromboli: Pepperoni Steak Bacon and Meatball; sauce on the side\nBottled Water\n\nThe Wedding Soup arrived rather hot (microwaved) and in a styrofoam container. I am always wary of styrofoam adding flavor, but it didn't in this case. The soup was actually rather tasty and we split it between the two of us. I do have a fondness for a wedding soup that has a strong cheese flavor to it. \n\nOur pizza was the next to arrive and looking at it I was a tad distressed as I could see all of the added seasoning and all of the seasoning in the sauce. I took a piece hoping the heat would sterilize the flavor of what appeared to be excess spice. I ate the entire piece but was not pleased. I took another piece to see if the cooling process had amplified the flavor and found that it had. I decided to wait on the stromboli.  I looked at my friend and asked him what he thought and he just grimaced. He is much more forgiving of over seasoned items than I am and he still stopped eating the pizza in favor of waiting for the stromboli. \n\nWhen our stromboli arrived, I was happy that I ordered the sauce on the side. I served a piece to my friend and found, much to my chagrin, that sauce had also been placed inside the food. I had already committed both of us to trying the pizza pastry by this point and decided to move forward. What I tasted made me stop eating. Not only had they put sauce on the inside, but they had put a lot of extra Italian seasoning on the inside. \n\nI don't know how people can eat this much Italian spice. I can only assume that the people that like this spicing of their food also like to eat spoonfuls of Italian seasoning out of the spice jar in the cupboard. If not for the Italian Wedding soup I would really want to give this parlor a zero star. \n\nI will not return.
3 ||| One of the best in the city.  BUT!!!!  DO NOT GO THERE IN A CAB!!!!   They will charge you up the arse!
2 ||| The beers here used to be just HORRIBLE, and I mean HORRIBLE. However there is a new brewer there now and things have improved. Still your standard run of the mill beers, but at least they are drinkable now!\n\nThanks again Las vegas Beer Tours, without you I would never venture all the way out to this place for a beer!!
0 ||| I have used this shop for a few years, but I have to admit I am not happy with their service right now, I had a Hayward vacuum that they fixed twice under warranty, and the same thing broke again - instead of perhaps considering I just got a bad vacuum I was told I had excessive use???? Really - how exactly does one use a pool vacuum too much?  I don't run it 24/7, its a small play pool and the vacuum is less than 2 years old.  Now they want me to pay over $200 and to be honest they weren't very nice about it either.  I don't think I will go back here.
2 ||| Pro:  Absolutely beautiful collection.  A great mix of ancient through modern items.  I especially enjoyed the kachina dolls.  Con:  it cost my family $84 admission (my husband paid before I noticed the price and could say \"NO!!!\").  $15 for a ten year old?  Exorbitant!
1 ||| I wish I could say that my complaints are isolated to this single store. They are not.\n\nThe food is cheaply done for a not so cheep price. One dish tends to taste like five others that they have. Like its the same sauce,  just with different meats and sometimes vegetables. \nIt feels like the place belongs in the food court of a mall. Not near a Goodwell. I suppose its location can tell you something about the quality of food one is going to get.\n\nThe employee always look over work and seem to not enjoy being there. It makes it feel like I have slave labor preparing my food. Which is a little disconcerting. \n\nThe bathrooms are not to bad, but at timea are filthy. At least the food and dining area look clean most if the time.\n\nI can't recommend this place as I avoid eating here myself.
2 ||| I took my two boys on this adventure and I guess I was expecting more. We went up Bulldog Canyon and it was beautiful, but I was expecting a little more excitement in the hummer (steeper terrain or some thrills) plus some deeper expertise from our guide. We got neither. It was an experience that we will sort of remember, but think it may worth looking around for other options.
3 ||| When it comes to food, generally I try and go down the path unknown and try something new when dining at a restaurant I have been to a few times. When it comes to Carrabba's through, I stick to my personal favorites: \n\n-Calamari Ricardo (think calamari with herbs and spices and an  amazing garlic/butter dipping sauce)\n-Spendino di Mare: a lightly breaded and fried combination of scallops and shrimp. \n\nPlus the bread they serve the table is awesome when you dip it in the oil/pesto mix they set on the table for you.
0 ||| Not only is this location dirty, they lost my appointment and made me wait an hour and just when my name was called they found my appointment so I basically waited for nothing. I then received a call the next day from my Dr's office telling me the blood drawn was contaminated due to the vial being left out overnight. Are you serious!? DON'T GO HERE.
1 ||| Not a fun experience at this IHOP.  What wrecked it for me was bringing my kid there before school to get breakfast and finding out AFTER the food has been delivered that they are not accepting IHOP gift certificate cards because their computer is down and has been down for a month.  REALLY?  Right after the holidays?  I call baloney on this.\n\nThe server said \"Oh there is a sign in the front that says we aren't taking gift cards...\"   Well we looked for the sign and guess what?  It was not on either of the double sets of doors when you walk in.  It was a plain paper sign attached to the cash register.  Now who the hell is looking there when you walk in?  Can somebody say lame??  I can.  LAME!\n\nThe food was average.  The service was underwhelming.  Avoid.
2 ||| My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's \"Seat Yourself\", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back.
0 ||| Dr. Mark Woodland did such poor work on fillings in my families mouth that the next dentist we went to said we should file a lawsuit.\n\nNot only is his work 2nd rate but we are seriously considering filing a suit. \n\nThis man should not be practicing Dentistry.
2 ||| This is not in Ballantyne
2 ||| good ol southern family owned busines.
3 ||| Oh, so tacky and cliche. That's what makes Buca di Beppo so great. From the Christmas-light-wrapped statues outside to photos of nuns running through the ocean inside, everything gaudy and over-the-top about Italian-American culture is embodied in the restaurant.\n\nThe experience starts with the escort to your table, which takes a detour through the kitchen (where there is also a booth table. In the kitchen.) and around by the Pope Room used for large parties (with a creepy wax bust on a rotating dais in the middle of the table).\n\nFood is served family style. A \"small\" plate will feed 2 to 3 people. Everything is very tasty - I personally love the baked pasta dishes, the garlic bread, and their salads can be a meal by themselves, too. Not a place you want to come unless you are feeling hungry.\n\nMy only complaint is that their only Charlotte location is in Pineville and rather tough to get to for me. But when I'm in the area, a great place to stop!
4 ||| To say in words would do an injustice to it's amazing craft of Italian food. Try to go during the week when it is not so busy.  If you love Italian food, this is the place to go.
3 ||| The food and drinks where great. This place was full of specials from 55 cents wings to happy hour drink specials! The waiter was friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back again.
2 ||| I saw this restaurant on my favorite Food Network show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (Hosted by Guy Fieri). You know, \"Tripple D\".  I was in Charlotte for the weekend so I thought why not try out a restaurant from that show. \n\nI came there on a Sunday morning. The line was out the door like any busy, famous, and neighborhood-friendly restaurant for brunch. (TIP: Always go where the locals go.) We waited for 15 minutes and were seated quickly.  The waitress and staff were sweet...like how they should be in the south. We ordered jalapeno bombers for appetizers. It was good...like Church's Chicken good! I had the greek sampler... moussaka (greek lasagna), Spanakopita (spinach pie) and graped leaves stuffed with rice and feta cheese. Oh, I had a side of green beans and corn but too full to touch it. My favorite was the moussaka because I'm not a big fan of feta cheese that was in the spanakopita and grape leaves. It was good and I finished it. I ate what was suggested on Tripple D so I left there happy and full.  Oh, don't forget to check out the desserts in the glass window by the door.
1 ||| I've been to a much nicer amusment park or even just a fair. $25 for unlimited rides that open at 6pm-11pm for me sound like a ripped off. The rides are kinda lame. This place is poorly designed. They're trying to fit as much in such a small space. The wait for rides aren't long at all I guess that's a good part. It's so sad that Phoenix is a big city but this is all we've got.
0 ||| Probably some of the most awful/over priced sushi I've ever eaten!! I am a crazy sushi lover!! I just moved to Arizona from LA, ca and I've been checking out different sushi joints....trying to find the best one in AZ. This place was crazy over priced for the crap food they gave us! My husband got salmon and I got a few rolls. The food quality was AWFUL! The service sucked! I don't mind paying $100 for a few sushi rolls, soup, and some salmon, but it better be good! Sadly it was not, the rolls were small and very thin...the rice was hard! This was the first time in my whole 22 years of eating sushi that I've ever experienced hard rice on a sushi roll!! On a better note, the salmon and soup was pretty good! I will NEVER return to this place......
3 ||| Decided to try out taylors for breakfast today. I started with the fresh squeezed orange juice. This is the pulpiest fresh orange juice I've ever had. It was great. Then my dish came out I ordered the Asian crab omelet. It was very good it came with crabmeat, green onions, avocado, and cheese. It was excellent all the ingredients seemed very fresh. This is a nice new find for breakfast in my area.
0 ||| The person that said a limo would come and get you for free was lying. I emailed them for a bday party last week on a Wednesday night, so not even a busy night. The woman who replied was nice, said she'd follow up with me on Wednesday (never heard from her again) and that the limo would pick us up on Wed night. The limo never showed. If you are a straight guy, just enjoy the beautiful go go dancers all over the strip. If you want men, spend your money for Chippendales but don't go to this place!
1 ||| I don't know if it's nostalgia or tradition to eat a meal at Sam Woo BBQ in Vegas since this was the go to place for some great roast duck and Chinese BBQ when Chinatown first opened. But I think this was my last time and time to move on. The duck and chicken was terrible, and tasted like microwave leftovers. The only plus stars are for the clean restrooms and the fried rice. It's sad that this place has taken a dive to the \" stay away list \". Cash only, always apathetic wait staff. No pics because even this photographer could not make the food look palatable.
3 ||| Solid Polynesian fare that will leave you full and singing Don Ho.   The Kahlua pork is the reason to get you in the door but there are several other items that make a good meal.
4 ||| COCONUT GINGER IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE. Other must trys: whiskey caramel, turtle, Grand Marnier, Baileys, Mint, s'mores and vanilla bean caramel. The german chocolate cake is fantastic. Just go there.\n\nOh... they made this awesome power bark too.
4 ||| I loved this zoo.  The experience is amazing.  You can see the animals so close.  We went with another couple who also has twins, so it was a blast.  We started at the west entrance because we wanted to leave the aquarium and \"wet\" experience towards the end.  There are several stations where you can feed animals.  Make sure you get change at the gate ( you need quarters for the machines).  I didn't mind that everything is pretty much \"a la carte\".  The skyride is $4 per person.  It is worth every penny.  It was so much fun to ride above the zoo and observe the animals.  So beautiful.  The train ride was also $4 per person.  The carousel was $2.50 a person and feeding the rays was $3, which my little boy had a thrill.  He couldn't stop laughing whenever the rays touched his little fingers.  I got to touch them too, they are funky in a cool kind of way.  The only one that we thought was a little steep was the Log Flume ride, at $6 a person, we decided it was not worth it. The kids had a blast at the petting zoo, they still talk about it even a week after being there.  Another thing that was great was having a real restaurant available inside the zoo.  They have a Dillon's in there by the stingray station. We spent 6 hours there and we couldn't believe we missed the penguins.  I guess we will have to go back.  We all agreed, we couldn't find a reason to go to the Phoenix zoo anymore.
0 ||| so incredibly overpriced!!! falafel balls are $1 a piece!!! and not even balls. they look like mud cakes. we got 1 eggplant parm, 1 pasta, 2 milkshakes, and 8 falafel balls. $70!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a milkshake is $8!!! and it's cold milk with a ton of sugar on the bottom. waitress waited on all the tables alone and was in the kitchen most of the time. the location is so totally out of the way. food is gross, all just dumped on a plated and popped in the oven. plate is BOILING HOT, food takes a minimum of 30 minutes to prepare. i am NEVER EVER going back there. if you want good kosher pizza, go to Nina's Cafe on Flamingo.\nalso, the menus are gross, laminated and filthy
2 ||| Just moved to the area so I am looking for a go to spot. Vincents isn't going to be it. The food wasn't great it was just ok. I had the italian sausage. The prices are reasonable and I got my food in a timely manner but no personal customer service. I sat at the bar and literally no attempt to have any dialogue except get my order. No other options ill go back but that's it. Or I may try pizza and have it delivered.
4 ||| I lived in Japan for 4 years and ate at many restaurants there just like Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan.  The food was so authentic that I got immediately homesick for Japan and the owner is a wonderful Japanese man who is gracious and friendly.  If you want really authentic (not Americanized) Japanese food, you need to eat here!
0 ||| Used their on-site optometrist who wrote a prescription for one year (wasn't aware of the one year until today).  I broke my prescription sunglasses and it has been 14 months since my exam and I can't get new sunglasses without paying for an exam because my insurance covers and exam every two years.  Now I know to ask about the optometrist's expiration date prior to scheduling an exam.  I've lived all over the country and never had a lens prescription expire in 12 months!  Also, I paid substantially more for the glasses at lens crafters!  Most of my scripts either didn't expire or expired in two years!  I don't believe AZ requires the script to expire in one year.....just a ploy to get more money.  I'm pretty sure people are wise enough to schedule an exam when necessary.
3 ||| Let me start off by saying we had a great time. The room was comfortable, the water park was both convenient and great fun, the staff were all friendly and helpful and staying in August meant we got a great rate for all of it. \n\nIt surprising to find a resort that aspires to be high calibre overlook some of the details. Admittedly, they didn't affect our vacation, but finding trash and clothing from previous guests when we arrived in our room is a little sloppy; as was the dead bird at the base of the slides for two days.\n\nI can only assume the high price of resort food and drink is a kind of 'window dressing' to remind us this is resort as they  are really missing the volume revenue opportunity from the captive audience by motivating the larger proportion of guests to explore the wider phoenix area.
1 ||| I usually like going to this market because they have great deals on the produce. Some of the staff though...*clears throat*... So Friday, I decided to stop in and pick up a few things. I started checking out and the cashier, Virginia was nice, but the sacker, not so much. Quite an a-hole actually.  Ole short Bud Bundy from Married With Children looking guy. I think he may be newer than most of the other people there. \n\nSo I got different types of apples that were located in the bins specifically saying .89/lb. The 1st set of apples, the cashier rings them up  @ 1.29/lb and I tell her that the bin where I got them said .89/lb. Virginia says, well they're 1.29/lb and then asks me do I still want them. I needed apples so I said fine.  They same thing happened with the 2nd set of different apples.  Why would I pay $1.29/lb for apples when I could get ORGANIC from a store such as Sprouts or Fry's? Like...whet? So the bagger says \"Well I can see the sign from here and they say 1.29\" I say \"I didn't get those there, I got them in the bins by the oranges and strawberries.\" He then goes off to the section that I just told him that I DIDN'T get the apples, and then proceeds to come back and tell me the 1.29/lb price. Sir, seriously?  I again told him that was not the section where I got the apples and he tells me, \"Well  I'm not about to go running around the store.\" I'm sorry, whet? Are you not at work? Are you not getting paid? I said to him \"You act like this store is huge, you only went about 15 steps and didn't even go to where I said I got them.\"  Hell if he didn't want to be a sacker/runner, he should've applied to be a cashier so that he could just stand there and just have to move his arms!\n\nI can't stand when people go into work and act like it kills them to, ya know, WORK. If you don't want to be at work CALL IN. Nobody needs the attitude! Like I said, I like Ranch Market because of their great deals on produce, but some of the male workers they have there...*side eye*. Also make sure the the right items are under the right prices
0 ||| I always liked weiss, when I found a hair in the butter the size of my waste, I said that's it! It is a turn off to see something like that in your food. Even though I told my wife about it she does not care she loves this place,but me, where it use to take me 5 mins to eat, now takes me 2 hrs because I am looking for another belt for my waist.
2 ||| This place is so hard to find.  I know it is in Station Square; that wasn't the hard part.  The hard part was finding the restaurant once I arrived at Station Square.  I really don't care for the organization of this odd mall, but that is another review.  Located at the North-East corner of the complex on the second floor, Sesame Inn is easily missed.  After having called the people several times on my cell trying to figure out where they were located, I was finally able to get to the stairwell leading to the front entry.  \n\nUnintelligible Chinese people? Check\nChinese kitsch? Check\nGood Chinese Food? Read on...\n\nSo far, so good.  Everything was appearing in place and had the proper feeling.  I was craving some good Sichuan food.  We were seated by the host and I looked at the menu solely to make certain that what I wanted to order was present.  When the server arrived I asked her some quick questions to make certain that there wasn't too much of a deviation from what I was craving and ordered:\n\nEgg drop soup\nWonton soup\nPanfried pork dumplings\nCombination rice (no peas or carrots)\nKung pao, extra spicy, with only peanuts and red bell peppers\n\nOur server was quite peppy and sounded like she was a first generation American since she spoke English flawlessly to us and then spoke Chinese to people in the back.  She was quick to bring out our Iced tea, Pepsi, and soups.  I was a tad taken aback by the appearance of my egg drop soup -- it was a deep red instead of a light yellow.  I spooned it through to make certain it was the right soup and found the cause for the deviation -- the addition of tomatoes to the soup.  Feeling comfortable, I tried the soup.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  It was thick and heavy with very little of that flowered egg/broth combination that makes for a very good egg drop soup.  I could live with a thicker soup, just don't take away the flavor.  The wonton soup also had that heavier feeling about it as compared to some of the lighter wonton soups that I have tried and enjoyed.\n\nOur panfried dumplings arrived to our table and they smelled good.  While the skins were a little thicker, they weren't dumpling thick and the meat filling helped to balance it in terms of consistency.  The flavor was a bit muted, though.  Trying the dipping sauce, I received a bit of a shock.  Contrary to everything else thus far, it was quite vibrant. The dumpling sauce had a very strong acidic flavor to it and could possibly have use a tad less vinegar in the preparation.  Together, though, I enjoyed the dumplings and dipping sauce.  And, truth be told, I would rather the sauce be a little strong on the acid than a little week since I can always dilute with some soy sauce.\n\nOur entrees arrived and they smelled quite good; but I had to send the chicken back.  There were mushrooms.  Sorry, can't eat mushrooms.  While waiting on the chicken to return, we started on the fried rice.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  It was fully cooked, but it was a bit soggy.  The meats were somewhat flavorless and only added another texture to the whole dish.  The flavor of the dish as a whole did not transcend being rice and meat.  A good fried rice really helps me understand the adage, \"Greater than the sum of the parts.\"\n\nAs we were finishing the fried rice, the new chicken arrived.  It was steaming hot and smelled good.  It looked to be more in a red sauce than a glaze as is customary with Sichuan foods.  I figured as long as it tasted good then there would be no issue.  I took my first bite.  It was sweet.  It wasn't piquant.  I had asked the server if items were spicy.  I had asked her about which peppers she thought were hot.  The chicken tasted okay, but it was nothing spectacular.  I continued to eat the entree and finished it.  It could have at least have been made from white meat since it was not spicy.  Oh well.\n\nThey don't serve Sichuan food here.  It is too heavy and sauce oriented.  I would say that it has to be some mixture of Cantonese, Hunan and Mandarin. Will I return, probably not.  Why?  I just don't like the Station Square location.  There are other Sesame Inn in Ross Township and Dormont.  I will most likely try again at one of those related restaurants to see if I like anything else on the menu.  For better or worse, it is one of the better Chinese in the area.
4 ||| This place is a hidden gem.\n\nLocated in an obsure strip mall... I took a date to this place and the dinner, the wine, the dessert... ALL TERRIFIC.\n\nThe atmosphere is 1980's... The Soprano's... Jersey Italian. \n\nGreat place to bring a date. Great place if you're hungry and you want a wonderful meal.\n\nAnd don't let the quiet exterior fool you. When we walked in... the bar area was packed and there was a nice mix and old and young dining in the dining area. \n\nTheir fresh out of the oven garlic bread was delicious and their pasta... awesome. \n\nGive this place a try. You won't be disappointed.
0 ||| if i did not have to go here for insurance i would not ! they are close that's it !! i get that they want you to sign in sit down shut up and stay that way till called !!! but to yell at people who have a question , that is wrong !!! older people kept coming in ,  forgot the sign,sit,shutup!! asked a question and got yelled at , u are there to help not make people feel like crap !!!!
4 ||| Bossman has been whining ever since Shogun Express on Camelback closed a few years ago. Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! \n\nWe had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!\n\nI picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot! \n\nP.S. They accept Visa & Mastercard, but not AmEx or Discover.
1 ||| I was really expecting much better things from this restaurant. Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu, I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food. Well, not so much. My friend and I showed up around 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full. That should have been our first hint. The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country-style tables, carpet, and booths. Overall, it just looked a little dated and old, especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair. \n\nThe dinner menu isn't huge and has a handful of selections for seafood, steaks, and pasta. I opted for the potato-crusted whitefish. It came with a cream sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. It came out nicely presented, but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches. Maybe you're not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it, but at $18 that was absolutely ridiculous. My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good, but so rich she could only eat half. And, BTW, it was corkscrew pasta, not macaroni.\n\nSadly, I didn't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good. And there was also a good looking maple banana cake, but I refused to spend any more money there so I can't attest to the desserts. Overall, this place is way, way overpriced and I would never go back.
3 ||| So a friend and I went to Alexander's because it was the closest restaurant to his place and we didn't feel like driving on the snow-covered roads.  I didn't have high expectations - I thought I would get standard Italian fare with nothing special while also probably paying too much.  From the get go I was wrong!\n\nThe decor and ambiance isn't upscale but it also isn't terrible.  It feels like a down home, mom and pop type of restaurant.  It sort of reminded me of a place that Tony and his crew would eat at in \"The Sopranos\" - good food and cool ownership.  When we entered, it looked like the owner was chatting it up with some regulars.  Seeing us, he warmly greeted us and introduced us to our waitress.  Before I get to the food a note on the service.  Our waitress was great - super friendly, helping us with any questions, and checking up on us during our meal just enough to feel taken care of but not intrusive by any means.  I could tell this wasn't her first rodeo.\n\nThe food was spot on.  Along with our menus, we got a basket full of fresh Italian bread and butter.  The bread was standard white but it was moist and tasted very fresh.  But you know how it is - don't fill up on bread!  Perusing the menu, they had a lot of variation which I love - chicken marsala, spaghetti, etc but the chicken parmigiana sandwich was calling my name.  It came on hearty bread strong enough to hold the sandwich and not fall apart.  The best part was the chicken which was crispy!  It came with what tasted like homemade sauce and cheese.  It's a simple meal but very tasty - you bite into it and first get the slightly sweet sauce and cheese then the hearty chicken.  Mmmm.\n\nThe sandwich was around $9 and it came with fries.  A very good and hearty meal.  I look forward to trying some of the other options at Alexanders the next time around!
3 ||| Became our normal grocery store until we figured out where Trader Joe's was. Prices were never too high and they had special events from time to time, such as beer tastings.
4 ||| Oh burrito, where art though?\n\nI haven't had a good burrito in quite a while and decided that I wanted to visit Carolina's in South Phoenix (12th st and Mohave - just south of Lincoln) . I hadn't been to Carolina's (Cave Creek and Cactus) since we moved from North Phoenix a while ago. As my first visit to their downtown location, I was quickly reminded why this is one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Phoenix. \n\nI waited in a line filled with of \"out of place\" business casual, police officers, and Mexican nationals alike. This isn't exactly what I would call the normal business lunch locale; you don't come here for the ambiance. The food is served on styrofoam and paper plates, and the table service doesn't exist. I definitely don't suggest taking your special lady here on a date night.\n\nWith ala-cart tacos and burritos ranging from a couple $ through six or seven, this place is easy on the wallet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I savored every last bite of my Machaca (aka: beef) burrito, and taco! That was one great meal. Now I can scurry back to my mid-town office and finish up the day in style. Carolina's claims the valley's best tortillas; which can be ordered by the dozen and taken home, and you won't hear any disagreements from me. The fresh made tortillas are super thin, tasty, and never seem to break when you eat them, like many others will do.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, Carolina's serves up some mean Mexican delights!
4 ||| I first bought tires from this Dealer for my old Ford Explorer (aka The Batmobile) about 4 years ago and absolutely fell in love with this place.  They're professional, friendly and get the job done.  I grumbled a little bit about buying warranty certificates for all my tires and didn't fully appreciate that until I'd gotten a few flats, nails, and cuts.  Those tires were replaced free, well except for the cost of buying new warranties @ $20 each. On a side note, while their waiting area is kinda small, it is air conditioned and they do offer free water and clean bathrooms.  They also offer free tire gauges. \n\nI've returned, last year, to both replace and upgrade the tires on my Toyota Highlander (aka Wonder Woman).  I opted to purchase the best tires for my van, which they didn't carry in stock.  The day I went in to get the service, the manager informed me that they didn't have them and offered me an additional $30 off for waiting. I greatly appreciated them understanding  that \"TIME IS THE TRUE CURRENCY OF LIFE!\" I was given a lift home, while Wonder Woman waited for new tires and someone came to pick me up when she was ready. \n\nThis year, one of Wonder Woman's tires got punctured.  Again, I returned for a replacement tire, since I'd bought warranties.  Again, no problems and fast service.\n\nSince this location is in \"my neck of the woods,\" I favor this particular location.  I've written about my experiences at others, if you're interested?
4 ||| I love this place!  Ask for it to go and you'll have left overs for days.  You can mix sauces to create any flavor you like.  Watch out though, it can get really hot or spicy if you put too much in!  Great for groups, family or a easy date time.
0 ||| First of all, let me state that I have been a long time fan of 5 & Diner. Rarely have I had a bad experience, and never had I had bad food. This has changed however, after visiting this location. Upon entering, it was perfectly clear that the manager was training several of the hostess staff as we wait to be seated. No problem, I understand training is necessary, and the experience with less than seasoned employees will be less than stellar. I get that. What I didn't expect was a bad burger. Normally, the Blue Moon Burger is one of my favorites. At this location however, it was terrible. The burger arrived wrapped in the usual white paper. Although this time, something was different about it. The burger along with everything else was pushed to the back as it was sitting vertically. Eating it was messy because the back end was full of grease and most of the competent of bleu cheese and sauce. Seriously, it was bad. There was taste of some blue cheese toward the front, then was met by a mouthful of mostly bleu cheese at the back. Definitely was not evened out. It was more like eating a bag of melted bleu cheese as desert AFTER a saucy greasy burger. I didn't make a scene by letting the staff know the sandwich was terrible because of the training going on. I'll let them work it out. But for this fan of the franchise, I definitely will NOT be going back to this location. I want to forget about this experience and drive a little further for a different location.
1 ||| Ack.   I don't need to wander around a store digging through a bunch of junk just to find one decent, hip shirt that's been tagged 'retro' and subsequently overpriced.\n\nI guess you can find great treasures here.  I wouldn't know.
0 ||| Very very bad service.. Went there twice for shrimp tacos after midnight and they said they couldn't sell them at the time cuz they were \"CLEANING\" the frier..went back after a half hour like the lady told me and still.cleanjng . Bad experience .. Very lazy workers. Wouldn't go there again
3 ||| I just randomly went into The Armadillo Grill. I don't usually try new places, but I'm so glad I did. My boyfriend and I started out with fried pickles, and they're some of the best I've had. The fried pickles come in two different flavors, original and Cajun; we got half and half. The pickles are spears, rather than chips. \nFor dinner I had the Grilled Cheese with soup; I could eat this every day it was so good. It was made with two types of cheese on sour dough bread, and they have a different soup every week. \nI give the food a 10, but the service was poor. I'm a server, so I know what the restaurant business is like. My boyfriend never got offered another beer, and I didn't get a refill on my soda until I was finished. I rarely saw my server, but she mentioned they had a groupon ending that day so that would explain her lack of attention. Although, the place didn't seem busy to me. \nOverall, I will be a returning customer. I have already recommended this place multiply times.
4 ||| I take all my clothes here for alterations and cleaning. They always do excellent work, pay attention to detail, and make sure I leave looking great. \n\nThe prices are fair, but the work high quality.  They appreciate repeat customers and will makes sure your clothes are ready on time to your satisfaction. I took in 3 suits, 3 shirts, and 4 pairs of slacks and they made sure each piece fit great before I left. One of the shirts was a little tight in the chest and they fixed it on the spot.
3 ||| This place is dive-bar personified, but I can see it becoming a place I will hang out at now that most of my friends have finally figured out that they have a better time when I am not around. \n\n4K is filled with all the potential in the world for a good time. Darts, pool tables, hot babe nudie video photo-seek machines, an internet jukebox and multiple large screen TV's. They have cheep drinks, Ladies Night and potato chips.\n\nSure the bar was empty except for me, the ex-husband and a guy named John for more than half the time we were there, but just as we were leaving the local regulars started showing up and you could tell that this is the type of place that good people that lost their way go to die. Exactly the type of place I would fit in. The Ex too. \n\nTanya, our bartender, was lovely and recommended the bubblegum vodka with Red Bull. She provided the option for both regular and sugar free Red Bull. Just for that alone I am bumping this place up to four stars. \n\nSure the bathrooms are small and the carpet is about a hundred years old, but who cares about that when you have your Blue Moon with an orange slice sitting next to you while you are playing nudie photo seek and James Hetfield is singing about war? Not this girl.
1 ||| Portion is huge,quite pricey.  This place is just okay for me,would not go back.
3 ||| Trader joes always has the freshest you can get. If you're a health nut then you will love this store. Its not as hectic as your standard grocery store and the chocolate covered jojos are to die for! It is mostly organic so as you can imagine it is more pricy than your average grocery, but if you're in need of fine food it's a wonderful place to go. I really don't like how small it is though, and wish they would expand it. I feel kind of claustrophobic in there!
3 ||| I admit, I'm a Carl's Jr fan.  They have such tasty burgers!!  \n\nAnyways, I used to frequent this location more often when I lived down here.  Open early, stay open late, with a very clean lobby area.  Can't complain!
2 ||| I have to be real and blunt I absolutely love this place but there are some big con's that forced me to dock some stars.\n\nAtmosphere:5/5 It doesn't get more authentic than this. When you walk into this restaurant you feel like your in Mexico. It looks like an old Mexican tavern. Dim lighting with a guy in the corner with a guitar jamming away. Honestly the vibes of this place was awesome! The bar was more than fully stocked. With your \"American vodka's\" and a WIDE WIDE selection of Tequila's. \n\nService: 3/5 The service felt very homey, like I had a Mexican mother cooking me home made Mexican food. The food was very wholesome in HUGE portions. I literally had no Idea where to begin. So I started in the middle and ate my way out. LOL Service at the bar could've been a bit better. I went during peak dinner hours so I guess that's why they neglected us. I noticed my group didn't get any bar tables stands for our plates like other groups so we ate directly on the bar.  Also our complimentary salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip ran low. I wasn't sure If I could as for more because it was complimentary \"well so I thought it was\" \n\nFood: 4/5 First the salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip. OMG was super delicious. The salsa was average but the bean dip was very tasty. but don't fill up on the chips. Next comes the pre dinner soup, not sure what it was but it was very bland. It looked spicy but it wasn't. Now the meal, it was very heavy, when I say heavy. I mean fatty, cheesy, and oily. I literally had to push around the cheese to get to anything. It was EVERYWHERE kind of an over load. The cheese enchilada lacked flavor, and on my 3 combo plate (1 tostada, 1 beef taco, 1 enchilada). The beef on the taco was shredded like pulled pork. It seemed more like a carnita. The tostada was very fresh because it was topped off with a big glob of guacamole. YUMMMM \n\nDrinks: 4/5 The drinks were just right. Not too strong, not too weak. A perfect blend. I ordered a margarita because I felt.. I needed to indulge fully into Mexican culture. It was a perfect combo to my meal. \n\nPricing: 3/5 My order was $13.95 a bit pricy for the Area of town it's in. But It was understandable because the food was good. The atmosphere complimented the food well. Plus it came with complimentary salsa and chips, with also this intro dinner soup.\n\nSuggestions/Advice: \n- Don't go during peak dinner hours if you want impeccable service.\n- Don't fill up on a lot of chips,salsa, and pinto bean dip.\n- Portions are huge \n- TRY THE PINTO BEAN DIP it was heaven!!!\n- Parking might be difficult its a very small limited area.
0 ||| They may be very nice, and helpful when you are buying from them, BUT customer service is non-existant if you happen to have a problem with something that you bought from them.  THE CUSTOMER IS NEVER RIGHT in their viewpoint!
2 ||| I've long been a fan of amusement parks and grew up spending hot summer days at Six Flags, Dorney Park and Hershey Park in the northeast. Some friends from up there came down for the weekend and we decided to check out Carowinds. I know what to expect from these places...ridiculously high prices for a day of exhilarating thrill rides. Carowinds rides definitely deliver the thrills, but it falls victim to the same issues to plague most amusement parks.\n\nLike the other theme parks out there, it's expensive to visit the place. Admission will cost you $45 (as long as you buy on their website...otherwise its $55 at the gate) unless you are frugal like me and opt to enter the park after 4pm, when the price drops to $25 online/ $30 at the gate. Throw in the $12 parking fee and you're dropping some serious dough before even entering the park. Once inside expect the high prices to continue, as you will be spending a crudload of money on food, drinks and other junk. We decided to eat dinner there and spent $23 on a chicken sandwich, turkey burger, side salad and small drink. Not only is the price high itself, but the quality of the food and service do nothing to warrant the price. It's hard to plan a day at the park without purchasing at least one meal there, so it is a necessary evil. Unfortunately it is a tasteless, inconvenient, rude and expensive evil.\n\nNow on to the park. I will say that Carowinds is one of the cleaner parks I've been to, and the bathrooms tended to be pretty well-maintained as well. The ride operators were slightly more friendly than the other service employees, but I suppose that running a roller coaster is more fun than standing in a booth selling parking tickets. \n\nThere is a decent selection of rides, though I did find that there were more higher-end thrill rides than moderate rides. If you like roller coasters than this will be a divine experience for you, as their coaster selection is pretty top-notch. Vortex was the first \"standing\" coaster I've been on and it was quite a unique experience, and the Intimidator was one of the fastest coasters I've ever been on. Unfortunately the miss' cannot handle the coasters like she used to and there were less rides she could go on than what other similar parks will offer. \n\nWould I go back to Carowinds again? Probably, but definitely not with just my wife and I. If other friends or family came to town at some point and I knew they were into these kinds of rides I'd be willing to shell out the cash to visit again, but I am in no rush to return. The coasters are definitely a lot of fun but the price of admission will stop me from going back any time soon.
1 ||| On a recent trip to the Valley of the Sun (or Hell is what it should be called during this time of year), I thought I would get my Greek food fix by visiting Jay's.  Bragging about their *authentic* Greek gyros, I thought, surely they would compare to our great Greek restaurants in the pacific northwest serving delicious food that will make me want to cry.  Sadly, I wanted to cry but not in the way I had hoped.\n\nTheir servings are huge and you do get plenty for what you pay for.  Their gyros are gigantic and they don't skimp on the lamb or chicken.  But the flavor was a bit off.  It just wasn't up to par with other gyros I've had and it didn't come with lettuce!  I ordered their Greek salad w/chicken kabob and although the chicken was charbroiled just right, the flavor was again a bit off.  Also, I wasn't a fan of their tzatziki sauce.  It was a bit runny and tasteless for me.\n\nWhat really turned me off about this place was that we ate lunch here at 3p and Jay's closes at 4p.  Why did the owner and family begin to start cleaning the tables and giving us dirty looks at 3:30 making us feel like it was time to leave?  With their mediocre salad and inhospitality, I humphed my way out of the A/C and into the outside furnace.
1 ||| Takes terribly long although I am Gold Member. Name is not listed on the board. Endless discussions.... It took 45 min to get the car.
1 ||| My wife and I eat here frequently and the quality has gone down lately.  I had the Meatloaf and it was not so good.  That visit was a couple of weeks ago.  This last week we stopped for lunch and I ordered a burger.  The patty tasted like the frozen ones you buy at Safeway.  Really??  Come on guys, put some effort into it.  It was tough and tasted like it had been frozen.   \n\nPeppersauce could be a great place but it seems like they are cutting corners......
3 ||| I stop in here every now and then for a Pastrami on a smiley. As everyone says its the bread that makes it. You can buy the bread but I think you have to order in advance for larger orders. The pastrami I had today was saltier than usual but still pretty good. nice staff, clean place. you can buy Board head meats and cheeses by the pound as well.
3 ||| Its not a very helpful place but It was clean. It feels old and outdated. I did manage to meet good people that helped me get to my location. For service Im okay if the place doesn't look good.
3 ||| I met a group of \"Spa Girlfriends\" here for dinner before we had a big meeting at the Doubletree. We needed something fast, yummy and close to 44th and Van Buren.\n\nBingo!\n\nI preface this review by stating that since i was in a group of 7, I didn't necessarily order the items that I would order (does that make sense?).\n\nWe had one great specialty dish (had the word Phoenix in it) with chicken and large shrimp and veggies in a spicy brown sauce - delicious! Other entrees included house special chow mein, beef & broccoli and sweet & sour pork. Again, not items that I would have picked, but for the group, it worked.\n\nThe main reason I give Lao Ching Hing 4 stars is it totally passed my \"sauce test.\" I am big on sauces. Specifically, the consistency of the sauce (and, of course, taste). I hate runny sauces ... I hate when there is not enough sauce .... And it's harder than you might imagine to get it right. \n\nAll of the sauces were great. Perfect consistency and very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of sweet & sour anything, mostly because I survived college working at a fabulous restaurant in Tucson called The Mandarin Grill and quickly learned the difference between real Chinese cuisine and Americanized Chinese cuisine. Sweet & Sour is the quintessential Americanized Chinese dish. \n\nThe chow mein was fair - not spectacular, but not greasy (the way it often is at restaurants).\n\nThe service was great. I never got close to emptying my water glass, and our group had a nice big table in the back where we could be as chatty and spunky as we wanted. The food arrived quickly, and everyone managed to clean her plates. \n\nI will return!!
3 ||| Like someone else said...you really need to expect Riazzi's to be what it is to enjoy it. Is this place outdated? Yes. Is the salad a little meh? Yes. And what's the deal with their ranch? It is SO watery. But their bread is awesome! And the Veal Piccata is to DIE FOR. Im somewhat of a Piccata freak considering I make it for dinner frequently and order it almost every time I go to an Italian place (chicken or veal). I have not had a better Veal Piccatta anywhere. So for that I will keep coming here when I am in the mood for a delicious Veal Piccata.
2 ||| When this place opened it was more under-the-radar. Over time, the sorostitutes started showing up (yes, at an off-campus bar) and the whole vibe/crowd got a bit worse. It became a bit generic.\n\nBut thats just my opinion.\n\n* for good drinks\n* for good shows\n* * for awesome outdoor seating
2 ||| I reallyed wanted this place to give me a yelp 5 star experience. It wasthe final of my two-day fat load for this new diet i'm on and so I though \"Italian\" The place was crowded, usually a good sign, but the ambiance- what ambiance? The presentation of the food was worse than what I do in my own home. We \"upgraded\" for $1 on each of our plates for homemade pasta (you would hope it would always be homemade). I had the ragu, it was ok- a little odd tasting. My fiance had the alfredo, which was kinda watery. Plus the garlic bread was $1/piece and was very hard to chew. All in all, not good or bad- but WAY overpriced! Over $10 per plate plus the bread and we didn't have more than one drink b/c the service was SLOW. Maybe its better at lunch?\nhmmmmm
0 ||| I am still so angry over my recent experience here last week, and I feel this is the only way people will truly know what an awful pharmacy this is. Now to be fair, I have loved this pharmacy for years. The techs all knew my family and our meds and we never had a problem. However in the last month, they got a new pharmacist \"Ron\" and subsequently lost a lot of their techs. My son has autism and is on quite a few meds that cannot be missed due to dangerous side effects so we always try to keep everything filled before they run out and this pharmacy always  did an excellent job. All of a sudden this last week, meds weren't filled at all. The wait times were ridiculous, for example I waited 45 min in drivethru for them to not have them ready. I was told \"tomorrow\" four times last week. Finally my poor son was completely out of his meds and missed over a days worth. When I came home Friday evening after a long day working in cardiac surgery my boy was pacing back and forth and so upset. He had a horrible day at school and was dizzy. It was a little before 8 (they close at 10) so I went to the pharmacy to see if they finally had his scripts filled and I also had scripts that his doc had given us that day. \n\nWhen I got to the pharmacy there were a couple people waiting, and I'm not sure how many were waiting in line outside. I could see the pharmacist and techs were busy and he was yelling at his staff. I dropped the scripts off and said I would wait. The tech whispered to the pharmacist Ron and told him we were completely out of meds. He was very rude and said \"absolutely not, we are too far behind to fill these tonight\". She apologized to me and said they couldn't fill them. They had two hours left before closing! I explained to him that we had waited all week for the one script and he was completely out of meds. He said he couldn't do \"anymore favors\". Really?! Favors!? He told me it was my fault for not getting there earlier that day. Well excuse me for having to take care of patients late. This is what we do in healthcare! I explained that (and he should know this) it is dangerous to miss psych meds and my son was already symptomatic. He told me it wasn't his problem and that he was going to have to stay late if he filled my scripts--and here I got off late taking care of a critically ill patient.  Amongst other horrifying things, he said he didn't care if he lost our family as customers. The tech even pleaded with him to make an exception and fill it and he snapped at her as well. I repeat, they had two hours and I would have been more than willing to wait until they closed. I was in tears at that point and I admit I did finally raise my voice and told him we were done with this pharmacy and would be going elsewhere. He told me nobody in town would be able to help me that night...again, two hours until closing! \n\nFortunately, there was a happy ending. The CVS down the road on sossaman took pity on a tearful, exhausted nurse and filled my scripts within 30 min. They apologized for my treatment at the other store and told me that store had recently lost a lot of employees because of this new pharmacist and had been sending other fed up customers to them. As a healthcare employee, we are supposed to be dedicated to our community and those in need of care. What a sorry excuse for a \"healthcare professional\"!
1 ||| Seriously... It's just a sandwich people. You can dress up bread as much as you want but if you don't do it right, don't brag about it. I've had WAY better. Two stars because they gave me a cookie.
2 ||| Wow, this place is so hit or miss. I'm honestly just not sure what I'll be getting for delivery each time I order (the same thing). They must have a different person cooking the stuff every single time because nothing ever comes to me the same as the last. \n\nI have had some great General Tso's here, and I have had some horrible way too spicy un eatable Tso's here. It's just so confusing.\n\nI enjoy the lunch special the best. Most lunch specials are around $4.99 and come with fried rice (or white/just ask) and a egg roll. Great! It's enough food for a second meal for most. Who can beat that? Pretty much anything and everything is offered under this lunch special as well. What a deal!\n\nGreat egg rolls, Very good Rangoon! Awesome soups! \nYet...like I said, you can't expect the same dish every time. It's a surprise to what quality of food will end up in front of you. \n\nPretty quick delivery (usually around 25-30 minutes). \nGood sesame chicken, orange chicken, beef and broccoli.
1 ||| What can I say? This was one of a very few places opened late-late in the QC, so it gets the job done. The portions are large, yet the flavor is just ok. The service was pretty decent as well as the prices. May go back in the future, but it will not be number one on my list of options. I know Charlotte is no DC or NYC, but we really could use more variety for late night dining.
0 ||| Second time I had there food because they're like the only ppl who deliver around here. WORST FOOD. The lo mein is good though
0 ||| If it were up to me this place would even get one star! I got a full set here only because it happened to be in the area I was at the time. My friends were going to get pedicures and they were $25! No. That's over priced. I could get a mani paid for that price normally! Anyways I got my set and the guy was rude! Kept telling me to hold still and would tap me on my hand with the file every time I slightly moved! The shapes were inconsistent and I new instantly they didn't feel sturdy. The moment I get home one of my nails popped off effortlessly! The next day ANOTHER!! It was infuriating! I didn't even go back to them to fix them cuz I'm sure they would have been equally as shitty as the first time! I normally go to signature nails on horizon ridge. GO THERE. THEY ARE FABULOUS. They even fixed my nails for free since I'm normally a loyal customer and they felt my pain!
2 ||| I'm floundering between 2 & 3 stars, but I'm feeling warm 'n fuzzy this evening, so I'm going with 3.  I used to eat at Ishi quite often, however it's been about a year since my last visit. Had nothing to do with them, just sorta happened that way (working from home a lot more, etc).  Since then, they've moved into a new building across from the strip mall they used to be in (formerly Fudruckers then Taiyo).  Much larger space, which is great , however the interior has sort of a \"design on a dime\" look to me.  Considering I got my lunch to go, I didn't have time to really evaluate things that closely, so I can't fairly evaluate/rate the ambiance, other than it being rather dark (lots of black).\n\nI've eaten here twice now in the last week & a half, and I have to say, they just don't do it for me anymore.  And that saddens me because the family that owns/runs Ishi is great. Food is still fairly yummy, however the value isn't as good as it once was (ie: I've noticed a steep increase in price w/nothing to show for it).  Meals come with either a side salad or soup at other places, but not here.  I'm a creature of habit, so as usual, I order a chicken/shrimp hibachi combo.  $12.  Used to be around $8.  Portion sizes are plentiful, so kudos for that, and service is speedy and friendly.  However for my dollar, I can go about two blocks away to Kabuto and nosh on a far superior meal for the same price (and the rice is 10x better...and, if you have the time, you get a show!).  Granted, unlike many of their competitors, Ishi's pricing remains the same at dinner, so that's a plus (portion sizes are the same at lunch and dinner).  \n\nI tried their clear onion soup the other day and was RATHER disappointed; tasted like a watered down French onion soup to me - kinda icky; not the \"clean\" flavor I'm accustomed to.  \n\nAll-in-all, Ishi is no longer on my go-to list unless I'm in a hurry or going with others.  If I do go, I think I'll just get Hibachi Shrimp & sub out the rice for zucchini & onion.  At least the owners & staff are still friendly - that get's them an additional star!
1 ||| Let's see....an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own Italian cooking show? Should be great, right? Not so much.\n\nWent here recently and ordered the pasta trio, since this is apparently what one gets at Lidias. Perhaps I went on the wrong day, but I thought that the three pastas (bolognese sauce, pesto sauce, and gnocchi with sage butter) were underwhelming. At the very least, there are Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that offer much better food for a similar price.\n\nThe one positive to Lidia's was the dessert - which was fantastic. I had a bite of a chocolate torte, and was very impressed. The coffee with grappa was also quite nice.\n\nAll things told, though, I would spend my money elsewhere.
1 ||| Whataburger what's the point, I got the Whataburger with cheese, onion rings and drink. It was a long wait, then the server brought out 3 orders at a time and my food was warm not hot. My onion rings where warm and greasy, they do theirs skimpy beer batter style not crunchy at all.  This location is near my job so it could be convenient but I don't know if I would bother since it was so underwhelming.
0 ||| Indifferent food, atrocious service.
4 ||| This is the BEST breakfast place in Madison, nay, the world. Try the 49'er pancakes and you'll never go back to regular ones. \n\nMy family eats there every weekend!
4 ||| Fast and friendly service, reasonable prices and the french toast was big, fluffy and delicious. If you don't beat the morning rush expect to have to wait a while. On the plus side they do offer complimentary coffee while you wait.   How busy it gets is definitely a testament to the quality of the restaurant.
4 ||| Best coffee in Pittsburgh, without a doubt. Believe the hype. I've been going here for years, and every visit is a pleasure.
3 ||| If I could, I'd pin a medal on Best Hong Kong for the stupendously good Pork and Oyster Hotpot I had there the other night. At 8 pm on a Sunday night, the place was busy (with about 2 dozen Chinese and me) and the service was very good. Not a fancy place, but it's all about the food--and the food is seriously good.
3 ||| Madison Mallards games offer fun and family-friendly entertainment for a great price! We paid $10 each for our seats, and honestly, I don't think there is really a bad seat there! I can see the food (priced like a typical sporting venue) driving up the cost of your experience, if you're not careful. But stadium food is always so tempting!\n\nThe game we attended was a pretty good one, with a home team win, but they do such a good job of keeping the crowd entertained in other ways, that I wouldn't have minded either way! The night I went, there were dozens of giveaways, contests, and even weiner dog races! \n\nI can imagine taking kids here, but can also see how it would be incredibly fun with a group of adults! I happened to be enjoying a date-night and I thought the experience was great in that context too!\n\nLooking forward to going back and hanging out in the much-hyped Duck Blind.
1 ||| I had to use this place while my car was being repaired at a local shop. The one young man was very nice and super helpful, drove me to the repair shop when I repaired the car as well. The reason for the low rating is the actual cars. The first car they tried to put me in was a Camry with the front bumper hanging off. The next two cars were extremely dirty: windshield had so many bugs and dirt you could barely see through, stains on the seats, etc. I would recommend going a few miles out and finding a better rental place or even a different Enterprise in nearby Gilbert or Scottsdale, where the cars are actually clean and nice in those areas.
2 ||| Not only does this Chick-Fil-A serve the standard fare that you can find at other CFAs that you know and love - and they do it with the same friendly service as well - they also have an excellent patio out on the side., next to the play area. Definitely worth a visit.\n\nThe only unfortunate thing is that you are in a parking lot, after all, but hey - at least you can sit in the shade while you partake in your awesomely fried chicken sandwich at lunchtime.
1 ||| I don't know what happened. I went to this resaturant with my boyfriend and daughter for dinner.  I read really good reviews about it. So we come in. Staff greeted us and we were seated immediately. It wasn't busy. We ordered our drink. I order hot green tea, my boyfriend orders hot sake. My tea was lukewarm, and tasted deluted and old. I was very disappointed.  We start ordering our sushi and rolls. Meanwhile,  the family in front us is ordering their meal, and a new couple is seated behind us a few minutes later.  We are waiting and waiting and waiting. The waitress,  is fly by us with no eye contact. The family in front of us has received all their food, and still our table hasn't been served. Finally, we were fed up once the couple behind us starts getting their food. My boyfriend is able to pull the waitress over to our table to complain about the long wait. And she starts telling us that she has placed the order, but if she tells the chefs again they will get mad. That's not my problem, we have been waiting more than 30 minutes. The family in front of us has finished, paid, left, and replaced by new people. Once we complain, our food starts rolling in, but our sushi is over powered by wasabi. We lift the sushi off the rice and huge chunks of wasabi are squeezed between fish and rice. I cleaned some of it off, but my boyfriend was very disappointed, he didn't eat any of his food. Once done we get an $80-something bill. The girl appologized. And gave us a $10 discount. But I think that is the last time we go there. I was very shocked, especially because of all the great reviews I read about it.    :(
1 ||| My husband and I had the classic cheeseburgers.  We were there about 1 PM and the place was almost empty, which is not a good sign.  We substituted the coleslaw for fries. When the waitress noticed at we were not eating the slaw, she offered to bring us fries.  This was nice. They were okay, not great. I wasn't happy that when I held the burger and noticed that the bread was cold.  Toasting or warming the bun should be customary, otherwise, why am I buying a burger when I can make a better one at home?  Good thing that the bill was less than $30.  We will not come again.  Was it a disaster? No, but a return visit, I don't think so.
2 ||| Pretty decent coffee shop and its open until midnight on weekdays.\n\nThe coffee was good and the staff were nice. I will go back. Nothing spectacular.
2 ||| This place is mediocre at best.  My husband and I ordered for carry out.  We ordered the crab rangoons as an appetizer, however, I think they forgot to add the crab to the filling.  The were stuffed with chunks of cream cheese--very boring and lacking in flavor.  My husband ordered the General Tso's Chicken and I ordered Cashew Shrimp, neither of which were remarkable.  We are going to keep trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant in the Madison area, that's for sure.
3 ||| A great meal:\nCarolina honey sauce on the St Louis or baby back ribs\nGreen beans\nLoaded mashed potatoes\n\nGet a half price lemon drop martini during happy hour!\n\nService was great, too\n\nEnjoying my leftovers today ;-)
0 ||| I once saw a puppy run from the kitchen into the side area. I asked the waitress about it and she said it was her daughters pet.
4 ||| We just moved to Vegas from Phoenix. I must say I'm pretty impressed. We typically try and find the best Chinese place and so far this has everyone else beat. The to go portions are a lot bigger then usual. Good quality food too. A must try if u want good quality.
0 ||| I'm a big Chop Suey fan but its not a lunch special  so I ordered off the regular menu, I can't say I was impressed, although the veggies were crunchy there wasn't much flavor to the sauce.\n\nThe booths are dirty and this old building is in great need of a remodel.  I wouldn't have ever stopped in if it weren't for some glowing reviews by other Yelpers.\n\nTo top it off there was constant yelling or arguing coming from the kitchen and a man putting boxes together behind a screen in the dining room, ever heard one of those loud tape dispensers throughout your meal!?\n\nI visited this location off it's previous reviews and I have to say they disappointed me.
3 ||| Looking for a good lunch, try this place.\nExcellent service, good menu selection, very reasonable prices.\nLiked the flat bread pizza, just right.\nWait staff checked our table regularly. \nWill go here first on next visit to Casa Grande.
0 ||| Usually me and my girlfriend get the sweet and sour chicken and crab angels and they're delicious.  But today I decided to get the teriyaki chicken and \"paper wrapped chicken\" and they both sucked no good at all. Usually give this place like 3-4 stars but today 1 don't get what I got waste of money.
0 ||| Stopped in for a glass of wine with a g/f and sat at the bar.  Feels very tired and old.  Also, a glass of mediocre wine and an ice tea being almost $15 is crazy?!  Definitely much better places in the area that I would go to instead.
2 ||| While doing some shopping around Arrowhead I felt a little nostalgic when my car ended up facing the Fuddruckers.  I worked at Fudd's as one of my first jobs in Calumet City, IL circa 1985...it was great, they used to give away all the buns that weren't used that day to the employees every night...ahhh....the memories.............\nThey aren't giving anything away these days-small burger with fries and a drink (FARKIN' YUCKY PEPSI B.S. PRODUCTS TO BOOT, as noted in previous lessons signs of a cheap-arse restaurant) was more than ten bucks!!  AND THAT WAS THE COMBO DEAL!!\nThe restaurant was empty as I probably went just as they opened at 11, so the friendly staff had no other patrons to tend so I was like a queen...The burger was as good as I remember though and so was the fresh bun.  Topped how I like, I wish they offered shoestring type fries though as I am not a fan of the wedges-they don't ever get crispy!!\nMy main beef (no pun intended) is with the prices, there's just not that sense of value especially these days.\nT Out :)
2 ||| Hm.  Not sure about this place  Some of it was great.  Some of it was mediocre.  I preferred the options at Raku more, but there were still some nice dishes to be had here.\n\nThe service is alright, but I didn't think it was cool that the Japanese family that showed up 25 minutes after us, got seated 10 minutes before us....  Without a reservation as far as I could tell.\n\nThe wait can be long so be prepared.  I too believed all the hype that yelp made me believe.  But I don't think it was quite worth it this time.\n\nThe seared salmon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=6WgsEfcGiclb05ZG51avRg  was very tasty as was the honey toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=XebPyNRUsR-OcZ61lfKjoQ .  Most of the other dishes were sort of plain.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=4QXEYaL6v2HEIbqixT2tvw\n\nThe chicken skewers were alright. but the meatballs were pretty good.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=X0gx3uofwH-JdZLwZEwXRA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=41bpHen74LWHqo5fItDNZQ\n\n\n\n\nGlad I came to try it out, but Raku will be my staple in Vegas.
1 ||| What's missing here? Service.  \n\nI can usually find a pair of cute shoes anywhere.  Payless had mailed out a coupon so I decided to stop in.  This store wasn't as clean and organized as others.  Luckily I still found some cute ones! \n\nWhen I went up to pay, she was on the phone.  I could tell it was a personal call as she wasn't talking about anything shoe related.  I waited until she finally put her friend on hold.  The second she finished ringing me up, she was back on the phone.  Not a thank you or any smile.  It was very unprofessional and rude.  \n\nI'm hoping they can improve the service and organization here.  A little bit can go a long way.
1 ||| I'm a regular for breakfast at Coppertop, but I'm not going to pretend it's anything more than it is. It's a poorly-decorated diner completely devoid of ambiance, run by Old World misogynists who don't give a shit. (I say this because we have seen the manager slap a waitress' arse while there. She did not seem okay with it.) That said, the food is decent, portions are generous, and it arrives in a timely manner. I have had mishaps there but I have never had to pay for something I didn't eat. I know what I am getting when I go there.
1 ||| I am redecorating my front lobby of my business; Essence of Harmony Sacred Massage.  After my artist / client Lucretia Torva stained the concrete slab of the floor, we needed a few NEW things to take my clients experience all the way to Morocco.  \n\nAt Pier 1, I was greeted by a lovely gal, very friendly, who had a thick German accent and couldn't understand English that well.  She did the best she could by showing me around to the tables, vases, etc... but she couldn't 'get me', so I suggested I just look around.\n\nNext, I bumped into a fella wearing the apron who acted too busy to help me, but did anyway because it was so slow that night.  I was a wee bit nervous picking out new things and it was clear that he tolerated me.  \n\nFinally, at the check out, I asked if there were any coupons I could use because I left my booklet at home.  He said NO, but gave me a small booklet in my bag.  After getting home I realize it is the same booklet I had forgotten with a 20% off coupon involved with it.  This could have saved me $30 which I would have appreciated grately.  \n\nPier 1 clearly did not have my best interest at heart.\n\nWhile the atmosphere in that place is like a child in The Chocolate Factory with Willy Wonka, I don't know how soon I will be going back.\n\n~ Luana Joya Lucia, International Massage Practitioner
0 ||| Went here last weekend with friends. Two of us became violently ill with food poisoning. Ordinarily, I would recommend the spring rolls and the pho, of course, but since my trip to the ER, I won't be back here again.
4 ||| Great food. great service. The owner obviously knows haw to please his patrons in every way.  Large portions of fabulous Italian classics. Go.\nYou will be happy!
3 ||| Great time! \n\nShowed up late on Friday only to find live music and great outside dining.  Margaritas were good! I had the  enchilada trio and my boyfriend had the steak plate. We enjoyed both and walked away satisfied.
0 ||| ahh well once again this is a place I go becasue others I am with suggest we go. Not once has anyone I have ever been with has ever had a good meal. This of course includes me. A lot of money for beyond bland. I will speak up if anyone ever trys to convince me to go again. I would rather Jack in the Box down the street. At least I can get yucky food for three dollars there.
2 ||| Chicago Hamburger Co. proves destination dining doesn't need to be stuffy. \n\nAccessible food, budget-friendly prices and an onslaught of Chicago-themed decor confirm this is a great place that I would think someone native to Chicagoland would be proud to have here in PHX. \n\nI ordered the 1/3 lb. Broiled Chuck Burger. The meat was prepared medium-well and came with \"The Works\" (ketchup, mustard, relish, shredded iceberg, tomato and onion.) While it was slightly too vinegary for my taste (too much ketchup), what made the sandwich was the GRILLED onions. They added a sweetness you don't often taste in a burger. The bun was good enough to hold it's own...and the sandwich contents. \n\nChicago Hamburger Co. has done for the Windy City what others like Ted's Hot Dogs and even Long Wongs have done for Buffalo: brought a bit of their local flavor to Phoenix. With this and the hard working staff to their credit, a taste of Chicago will be in Phoenix for quite a while!
3 ||| Went here looking for pho because I was having a huge craving for it. It's good beef pho and for a decent price as far as a big bowl goes, it was about $8 or so. \n\nOther than pho, they do have a lot of options and the ordering and serving is pretty easy. Be wary of when you order though. If you are somewhere in between lunch and dinner time, I've had problems with my friends and I getting a lunch portion when we wanted a dinner portion. But the portions are fairly priced so that's a plus.\n\nBut the staff is polite and the food is good and they even have dim sum if you have cravings for it like I do.
2 ||| This is a cool spot, and if I could give 3.5 stars I would.  Their pizza is really good, their burger was... meh.  The bartender recommended it so I gave it a shot and was underwhelmed.  I referred to it as \"burger jerkey\".  The pizza definitely made up for it though.\n\nOn the flip side the bartender was really nice and they also have Golden Tee, so bonus points for that.
3 ||| Good authentic mexican food and fast service. Great stop for lunch. Eat at these places instead of McDonald's and Jack in the Box!
0 ||| This is my first Yelp review and under better circumstances I wish I was writing my first great review. Unfortunately not. I'm usually like those of you who get too lazy to complain even if there's something wrong and usually there's not much that bothers you. However, this was my first car I bought with my hard-earned money and I wanted this to be a special event. I bought it last week but it was raining all last week so I waited and waited until today. So I scoured through my fellow Yelpers to help me pick a car wash that has great reviews. My eyes locked on World Class Car Wash and I spared no expense. I purchased the full detail $49 and Hand Wax $20. \n\nI told them that the previous owner had window stickers and decal everywhere. I told them about something he stuck on the dashboard and a residue that remained. I pointed them all out and I thought with paying $70 total for everything I would get some attention on things I specifically asked about. However, much to my dismay, the stickers and decal remained. I asked them to remove it and I thought it was good. Even up until then, I wanted to be happy so I just left. As I was driving my car I noticed gunk all over the window. The guy who was scraping with the razor to get the decals and stickers off didn't bother to throw decal residue out after scraping them. Everything remained. As I checked more later, I noticed candy wrappers from the previous owner still there but this time soaked breadcrumbs from being watered during the detailing process. It was nasty digging my hands down there to collect all the wrappers. \n\nI was very disappointed. This was my first car and I wanted it to be an experience. Sorry guys.
1 ||| So if u trying to stay close to the strip without paying strip fees then this is the Hotel for you. However, some of the customer service is bad. Some of the staff wasn't as nice as others. Also our television in the room never worked. I posted a picture by the way of the screen. Also I called for room service and no one ever answered. I would only stay here again if I was desperate.
3 ||| The only quality Chinese food I've been able to find in Squirrell Hill - they lose a star only for not delivering (which is perhaps unfair since not a lot of places here do), but it's worth it to pick up a to-go order.
3 ||| During a week long visit to family members in Madison, I needed to book a cab to get to the airport via the Badger bus at Chazen Museum.\nI was able to book online, receive updates regarding the cab, pay in advance.\nI had a great experience: when I saw the 3 minute update in my phone, I headed to the sidewalk with my bags and lo and behold my taxi was there.\nI got to the Chazen in plenty of time to catch my bus and the service was great. The lady who took me into town was helpful and friendly and knew answers to questions I asked about the local area and the bus stop.
4 ||| Ooh La La, Capital Grille is the most Ritzy and detail oriented restaurant in Charlotte, to help you understand what I mean allow me to tell a little story:  It was my Girlfriend's Birthday and I wanted to make a good impression on her, so I decided to take her to Capital grille in Uptown Charlotte.  I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.\n\nThen came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.\n\nCapital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out.
2 ||| My friend and I read some ok reviews of this place and decided to give it a go. Not crazy about the location but I think for lunch you're fine. I got the fish and shrimp with fries. The service was friendly, the food served quick and hot. The tartar sauce was pretty good and the cocktail sauce was pretty good. The fish itself was a little bland but I think that I will give them a try again but this time I will add a little lemon. I hear good things about the clam chowder so I think I'm gonna order that next time too. Maybe I'll be updating this review.
3 ||| If there is a better cake supply company in Phoenix, I haven't found it.\n\nAs an amateur cake artist the knowledge and experience of the staff is a HUGE help.  When I tell them what I'm trying to accomplish they give great tips and show me which products are my best options.\n\nThey'll also let you sample the food products before you buy.\n\nThey also have a schedule of classes that changes monthly for helping to improve your cake decorating skills.\n\nIf you're not careful you can spend a lot.  So take your list with you and try to stick to it.
1 ||| Food is hit or miss, but always packed and crowded. I've had the smoked salmon ramen and the udon stir fry. Neither were very good. Ramen was too salty and the udon was bland. The calamari salad is good after the first few bites, but the pieces of squid are huge and overly battered. The portion is huge, but you are left not wanting to eat the entire thing. The little scallop pasta appetizer was pretty good, and so is the bread they served complimentary when you are there at dinner (not happy hour). The sushi is about par with the grocery stores. Desserts look good in the dessert case, but I've never tried any. My biggest gripe is the terribly slow service! I've been there twice. Once on a Saturday around 3:30pm, once on a Friday night at 5:30pm. Both times, it took over 40-45 minutes to get our food. The last time I went, which will also be the last time I go, we waited close to 45 minutes and when I inquired with a waiter, he threw his hands up and in a joking tone,and said \"it's happy hour, there's always a wait.\" He didn't bother to check on the status of our food. His attitude was, \"Hey, we've got more business than we can handle...suck it up!\"  If you have time to wait for mediocre food -- be my guest!
4 ||| I like the food and donuts, but and more importantly, I really like the people who run this place and the people who hang out there.
1 ||| Been here a few times at lunch time because it's close to work, has a buffet, and costs about $10.  It's ok. Not the worse, not the best. I personally prefer Indian Palace (on this side of town) for the money.  Nothing here was extremely tasty or very spicy (I like spice and spicy); it was palatable.  Staff is fast on refills of water which is always appreciated.
0 ||| Poor service, with worse food. The only draw is obvious from the name of the restaurant. But that is why we have the internet.
1 ||| Chipotle claims they have Gluten Free food. We've had good experience with other locations, but this one is repeatedly clueless when it comes to Gluten Free. Their staff is incompetent when you even say the word Gluten Free because they've never heard of the term or can't understand.  They have lost our frequent business forever. We love their food, but not if I can't get them to prepare it in accordance to what they say they can do.
3 ||| I thought this was the cutest place ever and was excited that my gf took me here.  It has all the makings of something I like- different menu, little candies to buy, bakery items... \nAnyway, I ordered the poached eggs with english muffin, fruit salad and a side of bacon.  The portions were perfect.  The english muffin was so freakin good, I think it's sour dough?  Loved it.  The poached eggs were cooked just right and the bacon was a huge side.  I ate most of it.  My gf ordered the egg white omelet and she really liked it as well.  \nI got a couple of cup-cakes to go: one was the ooey gooey and the other was the pb&j.  I'd give ooey gooey 4 stars and pb&j 1 star cause it was way too dry.\nOne thing I'd add is it's sorta confusing for a new person.  I didn't know where to find our drinks or food after we'd ordered but everyone was really helpful and clued me in.  Although now that I think about it it wasn't that confusing.  \nI want to go back and try their pizza...

2 ||| I would give this place 3 & a half stars if I could but cant bring myself to a 4 star rating for this place just yet.  I came here this morning and had the Chorizo & eggs plate.  Couldn't figure out why this place doesn't have breakfast burritos but it worked out well anyway.  I ordered it for take out and the food was great!  I was a little disappointed that the tortillas were not home-made.  Although you could tell there was a little preservative smell to them but did not taste to bad (just not home-made taste).  The salsa tasted fresh and the beans were great.  The atmosphere is a little scary but it looks pretty new still and it is pretty hard to find since the sign is pretty small.  I knew about it because they came by my office and dropped off a coupon for take out.  I will go back for sure but I am not in love yet.
1 ||| Prepare to be hit with a $100 'Pending Charge' on the credit card to be followed up with signing for a $19 resort fee for each night you're there.  It includes use of the facilities such as pool access, internet Wi-Fi, etc.  \n\nThe Restaurant had already closed at 9:45 pm on a Friday night this past weekend. I didn't feel too bad about it after reading the local reviews on Yelp on the food there.  I decided to hit up Sangria's which is a bar that serves food as well as drinks.  I ordered the grilled Ahi Sandwich suggested by the server vs crab cakes being that it was 'more food' quantity wise.  It was served on a toasted Kaiser bun.  Came with chips, fried potatoes and something else I can't recall.  I chose the chips.  When served, it came on a warm plate with sandwich with tomato/onion/pickle/pepperoncini pepper on one side and potato chips (ruffles style) on the other.  No lettuce or sauce.  Ahi Tuna looked baked and very, very dry with nice color and some seasoning.  I recall seeing it advertised outside the bar with Aioli sauce.  When asked if there was any sauce to come with it, the staff could only bring me some tartar sauce.  Service was very lacking, most of the staff appear more interested in gathering in the kitchen talking or texting on their cell phones behind the bar than making sure any refills on my iced water were needed.  Having so much chips to go with the sandwich only made the driest sandwich experience that much more memorable.  \n\nCell phone reception was totally gone. I use Sprint and heard that overall Sprint in Phoenix can be very spotty.  Once I get to the car at the parking structure, I receive all my missed calls/texts (weird).  \n\nLocation somewhat far from most shopping. There is the Scottsdale Fashion Mall about ~15 minute drive.  Use internet / Yelp to find what you're looking for and plan ahead!\n\nRelatively pricey and isolated.  Perhaps better suited for golfers, retirees, couples looking for a private getaway at a quiet Tuscan style resort.  Not likely to return here anytime soon by choice.  My first 'fail' with a 4-Star Hotwire.com deal.\n\nOne nice thing is that I was able to talk front desk into getting a late 2pm checkout on Sunday after a long night of partying in Scottsdale.
0 ||| Awful service, mediocre food, and overpriced. Every time I go in there, it's like I am inconveniencing them by placing my order. I am never going back to this place. If you want good mexican in the area you should go to Elmer's, Taqueria Mi Casita, Si Se\u00f1or (New Mexico), or mucho taco. There are probably a lot more than that!
2 ||| Took some family members there that were visiting from back East.  Western theme carries throughout the menu and decor with picnic tables, old western gear sprinkled about and wait staff in cowboy hats. Reasonably good food for the money. The ribs were mediocre but the steak was surprisingly good for the $. Roasted chicken not bad either. Nice selection of micro brew beers. Service was great. Try the beer battered fries. Yum!
1 ||| Meh. Really was nothing more than a place to sleep in. I'm not going to complain too much, but lets be honest: what the hell are you expecting for $35 a night?
2 ||| Love this place. Hate this place. Lists may be easier... Here goes. \n\nLoves - strong tiki drinks in cheeseball ceramic glasses you keep, corny atmosphere, decent prices. \n\nLoathes - mega smoky environment (even the door guy was standing inside and smoking), weekend crowd with iq around 65, music played was far from tropic themed. \n\nI realized the trick was to visit earlier in the evening to have a better time.
4 ||| Two times eating here and two times leaving very satisfied. The pad Thai is perhaps the best I've had in Phoenix. The panang curry was nothing short of addictive. The mango w/sticky rice was a delicious end to the first meal there. \n\nI believe they've been in business 30+ years making them the oldest Thai place still in operation. \n\nThe service has been friendly, the location clean, so I will certainly be back!
3 ||| This is a fun thing to do with kids.  The staff are really helpful and friendly.  The supplies are everything I could imagine needing.
4 ||| We have been going to Roadrunner for a while now, and decided we wanted to give a review. We had breakfast with the best oatmeal anywhere for a starter. Then we shared an omelet which was cooked perfectly. We were there to watch football and the TV ' s in the bar are huge, like being at the game. The restaurant is very cozy and we will continue to go there.
0 ||| This is the most horrible dry cleaners I have ever experienced.  They completely destroyed a $200 shirt and just lost another silk blouse.  Throwing away your clothes would be easier than driving to this dry cleaner, dealing with rude service, and not getting your clothes back in the condition you gave it to them, or just not getting your clothes back at all.  They change their hours at will without updating their website to inform their customers, so you drive all the way out there after a long day at work, and find the doors locked without even an apology.  Very unprofessional... the worst ever!
1 ||| Today was the last straw. I'm never coming here for a car wash again.\n\nFirst of all, half the staff act a whole lot like they have better things to do than work at a car wash. Most of them are standing around, chit chatting and not doing anything to help customers. Today I decided to drive up to the pumps near the car wash center instead of the ones at the actual gas station. I thought I would save time and would have to make less stops. WRONG. I drove up to a pump turn off my car and was about to fill up my tank, and then the man standing over this podium looks at me like he doesn't understand what I'm doing there. He tells me \"this one is broken, go over there.\" Wow. Talk about manners. So why exactly is he standing there again? And why isn't the pump marked 'out of order'? I back out and pull up to a different pump. This next man was nicer, except he was so clueless. There wasn't a place to insert my card so I asked him if I can even pay right here, he says he doesn't know. But he doesn't think I can, and he doesn't know why. What? Lol.. But after he fills my tank he tells me to go all the way around and pay for both inside. Then come back to get my car washed. Which ultimately defeats the entire purpose of convenience. So I drive around to the front and after getting out of my car, I find that he didn't even put the cap back on and close it. Smh. Then when I'm inside paying I find out that what he should have told me is to leave my car there and walk in to pay, while a staff member DRIVES my car through the wash for me. So I complain to the cashier about how inconvenient this all is. She probably went out and told the guys outside because the second time coming around I pull up and I guess the manager? Comes out to tell me he's so sorry for the confusion and he \"upgrades\" my car wash. I thought that was cool but I'm still annoyed at how much of my time is being wasted. I don't understand what was so upgrading about my car wash though lol because my car was still dirty. Or was that because the man drying my car did a half ass job considering he spent such little time on it. \n\nOverall it was the worst but I'll throw in a pity star since I did get an apology from 1/5 people who made this a bad experience.
1 ||| I decided to braid my hair but ran out of hair I happen to have from California. Reading the reviews about the huge selections if hair I made my way across town to come check it out.\n\nI didn't have problems with dirty looks from the locals around there or anyone panhandling like others have had. The workers greeted me as soon as I walked in and were there for my every need. Unfortunately I was very disappoint to see that this really wasn't a warehouse as I expected. They seem to have more wigs than anything.  Aisle were very bare and they had a lot of old , dirty looking products on the shelf. As for braiding hair, the deletion was ok. They didn't sell the 27 Rastafari hair I needed and suggested I go to some other place that might have the brand. I don't live in the area of either store so I figured I can get a different brand around the same color. Big mistake. Luckily I was smart enough to get two different brands of hair cause one of them was so horrible i could even use it.\n\nI was able to pick up a new nail brisk for $1 but as far as that selection goes, it too is bare. Just a little stand by the line with things you can buy at any other local store.\n\nNot sure if I would come to this store. I'm better off going to Sally's or picking up hair back in California.
1 ||| First time, stopped in for Lunch.\n\nCute place, Beautiful patio, I sat inside though because it was very windy.\n\nAwesome, hot chips and fresh salsa, very good!\n\nI ordered the Pescado Pescado(see pics) I guess i had overlooked that the fish was fried in a corona beer batter ...........Very Overpowering flavor, I don't like beer at all, so that pretty much ruined the tacos for me. The beans and rice were delicious, though Certainly not worth $14\n\nMy Husband got the Cheese Enchiladas(see pics) They were also delicious, the sauce was just right. He said the food could have been hotter temperature wise.\n\nOverall a nice place for ambiance especially on the patio, the food was good except for the beer batter, if you like beer though it might have worked for you, and I think their prices are a bit greedy.\n\n2 stars \n3 words\nBeer Batter Splatter
1 ||| This place was not great.  They weren't busy so I got in right away, but that's about it.  The towels used were dingy and had holes in them.  The place looked and felt dirty. When the guy was cleaning my toes, he would wipe his tools on my feet instead of the towel. I wasn't impressed and will continue looking for a good spot near my house (have a great one near my office).
1 ||| The food is ok, and you get quite a bit for the price, but it's nothing to get excited about. I got the pad thai and it was dry. They also served it with a lemon. Everyone knows pad thai is supposed to have lime juice on it, and it isn't very tasty with lemon juice, I have to say.\nThe fried rice tasted heavily of oil, and I could definitely make it better at home. \nThe only redeeming dish that saved this review from being one star is the sesame chicken. It's light and a bit sweet and pretty tasty. It is a bit over-breaded though.
0 ||| Worst customer service ever. Scheduled to have Prodigy 2 brake controller install and was quoted one price after a full detailed description of what I wanted done. I have existing 6 prong plug and wanted to change it to 7 prong plug to pull my trailer. Got here on time and had to wait 45 minutes before finding out our customer rep was a no show and was transferred to a very rude; \"I am doing you a favor by doing this rep.\" After talking to her the price jump to nearly double, but we were in a bind and needed to get it installed. Then one hour later and after sitting there for past 2.5 hours rep came back and told us it was going to take 7.5 hours at a rate of $125 per hour. So this brake control is going from $287 to $403 to now over $1100. I picked up the phone and called 2 different RV repair shops and both quoted me a worst case scenario of 3.5 to 4 hour labor. I would have gone to them but neither could get me in the same day as I was leaving on a trip after the install. I requested to speak to the service manager after getting no help from the female service rep, \"I'm too busy eating\".  I was able to settle on a price for over $700. So why am I still here you ask?  It's because I have travelled 2 hours to get here and am in a bind to make my vacation and need to tow a trailer. I thought I had scheduled everything in advance to avoid any issue, but was wrong. Thanks to them it's cost me nearly tripled and I am waiting to see if they will deliver by 5pm as promised. If there was a negative star. I would have given it to them. All this hassle for being a loyal member. I will not renew my membership or recommend them ever.   Moving to AAA plus RV and shopping at Amazon prime.
0 ||| Will NEVER go there again! !!!! They over charge my gift card n they said it was the cards fault! !!! They have stole money from me before!!!! Who ever did my nails did a rush job cause it was crowded n it was a horrible job!
1 ||| I have a pretty long review on the Henderson version of this page.  Please check that out.\n\nLong story short is that Cox is the best offering out there for internet.  No other service can match their speeds for residential customers.  The unfortunate part is that their customer service is horrible.  It's downright unacceptable that they forgot to schedule an appointment, and then once it was scheduled they failed to show up on time.
3 ||| Enjoyed a excellent club sandwich and a unique side of jalape\u00f1o and cheddar mash potato.
1 ||| Authentic street signs!  The guys working here seem like tough south side guys which is sort of weird but thats alright. Still... I've got news for ya. The pizza isn't even close. We can say it's the water or whatever but they even call a pizza \"the UNO\" and it's a pizza hut special on a bad day. Not even close.  Skimpy crumbled sausage as opposed to patty and a nothing crust. The advertising might fool ya to come there once thinking it's chi style but you won't come back.  \n\nI'm not saying that its the worst pizza ever, because its not.  But it certainly isnt Chicago style and its simply mediocre mid-size crust pizza.
0 ||| Let me begin by saying I am a native of Madison and have been a lifelong lover of Michael's since it opened in 1986.  Let me also state that my rating is partly a protest vote against the asinine dance music that is incessantly  blared at the Monroe St. location.  The music has become so annoying I am struggling to bring myself to enjoy stopping by any longer.  I've asked the employees why it's played and I'm told \"it's the owner's iPod\" and that the employees basically can't do anything about it.  \n\nThat said, let's get to business:\nMichael's is Madison's local independent custard joint.  It's been around since the 1980s and has a solid history in the Monroe Street neighborhood where this location is located.  As far as frozen custard goes, Michael's is pretty good but it's just not what it once was.  Even I have to admit that rapidly expanding, yet Wisconsin based Culver's offers better custard today.  I've returned to Madison from Los Angeles for a couple weeks every summer for about 10 years and Michael's has gradually lost a lot of its appeal.\n\nThe Custard:  It's not as creamy as it once was but the real problem is that the flavors are losing creativity and failing to come together as they once did.  Case in point: my wife's Mint Chip had no chips tonight while another patron's was overflowing with chocolate chips.  The quality control is not there.  The texture is lacking the creaminess so important in good custard.  And the flavors rarely have fresh berries - a sign that the custard is just not made fresh like it once was.  \n\nThe employees were once local teenagers, usually West High Students or Edgewood High students that looked like they were having fun and engaging the customers.  Today, employees are disengaged and give you the impression they're just going through the motions.  They do the job...but that's it.  \n\nThe store itself is reasonably clean but it's the details that count.  The fluorescent lights are covered in bugs and spider webs, the parking lot is deteriorating, and the store basically needs some investment (bathrooms, lighting, landscaping etc...)\n\nThis takes me to my final point: the Music.  It drives my totally crazy.  Why is a Frozen Custard stand in Madison Wisconsin that is covered in kitschy 1950'sesque d\u00e9cor blaring club music every time I go there (this has been a constant for several years now)?  If the custard was perfect and the customer service impeccable, fine, I'll live with it.  But Michael's is a restaurant that has disengaged ownership and functions as a conveyor belt of cash to the owner's pocket.  It's the worst kind of independent retail: retail that doesn't care about customers because they'll keep coming back.  In the end it's sad to admit as a proud Madisonian that my Milwaukee friends are correct:  Kopp's is better.  Oh how I miss what you once were Michael's Frozen Custard.
0 ||| I'm afraid I will have to give this place only one star for being an absolute pain to find and general lack of information.\n\n My mom, sister and I were to have a girly afternoon tea, and the nearest tea room was this place. I came onto yelp, read the reviews, looked up the location in the map. When we headed to the tea room, we ran into a problem. A big problem. Aliens had abducted the business!! Just kidding, but the business was definitely not where the map said it was. Instead we drove around a little and found it on the SE corner of Dobson and Guadalupe!  So we drive up and park.... only to discover that it was CLOSED!!  I'm not sure if you were closed down or renovating, but there was no way for me to find out!   \n\nOh Abbey Gardens~ I was hoping for a lovely afternoon tea but was sorely disappointed. I hope to give you a second chance, but not until I have reliable information on you!
3 ||| First time ever coming here! Great little mom and pop place, for some old fashioned donut favs. I would have given it a 5 star but there was a tiny metal piece (I think a staple) glazed to the top of my apple fritter... I decided however I horse could have taken a crap on it and I would have still ate it anyway. Apple fritter was that good! Still warm out of the oven. \n\nWill be going back, just earlier than I did today.
4 ||| We ordered the sesame chicken & vegetable egg foo young; both were so delicious we ate every bite!
0 ||| I also found her rude, unwilling to answer questions.
2 ||| After living at the location in Chandler (which i miss), we decided to hit up this location.  I love Firebirds regardless of location.  It's seriously the best steak I've eaten. (yea yeah..  I know I haven't been everywhere).  For a chain it's great.\n\nWe show up about 6PM expecting the \"OH it'll be 45minutes to an hour\" wait.. But they offer us the outside with heated lamps.  So we take it.  Ohhh those lamps were nice.  We sit down and our waitress quickly shows up and takes our drink orders.  I ask for extra butter for our butt bread.. Yes I call it butt bread.  If you've been to Firebirds, you know why.  Anyway, i love butter, and Firebirds bread is the BEST pre-dinner bread in the world. \n\nThe three of us split the BLT salad and quickly devour it fast along with the bread.  Then we order our entrees.  I forget what my friends ordered, but I got my favorite; the Ribeye. Mmmmm.. With a baked potato.  Which are awesome.\n\nWhen my food finally arrives, I quickly mash all the goods into my potato and start going to town on it. That's when I notice. \"wow.. this potato isnt that good.\"   The toppings were ok, but the potato just seemed a bit dry.  Something I haven't experienced in a Firebirds before.  So for the first time in my FB experience, I did not finish the potato.. :(\nI hit my steak next and made quick work of it.\n\nGood location, I was hopin for a yummier potato.  Is that worth three stars?  Probably not, but I can always change it later on right?
0 ||| In the time I've been living on the road I have never had a worse experience.  Bad service, rude desk clerks, terrible management!  Waiting outside our doors at 9 am to get out when checkout is 11.  I would not suggest this hotel to anyone staying in the Charlotte area!
2 ||| Came here for my birthday tonight excited because I never have been (and being a vegas native) the lady that seated us was super pleasant and helpful, even pulled out an iPad for my nephew to watch a movie at the table so he wouldn't be all over the place our server kinda sucked forgot my sisters drink, didn't check on us, had to ask some one else to take our dessert order and for the bill, the place wasn't that busy and they have a milling people waking around... Whatever, then I asked the old bartender what way to the bathroom (that's wasn't doing anything) he was a snob and yelled \"YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT WAY\" ... I'll probably be back because the food was SO good but come on for a $450 tab you would think they would be on it...
3 ||| This is by far my favorite Chick Fil A in the Charlotte area.   No matter what time of day I go in, the staff are always super (and I mean like crazy, super, wtf nice).  Food is always hot and ready quick.   I would suggest not going right at 12:00pm for the lunch rush cause it gets super packed.\n\nThe kids that work at this store must be the pride and joy of their parents.   To be honest, it almost scares me how nice they are.    I am not going to lie, I have driven off a couple of times with an eerie pit in my stomach after a SUPER DUPER FRIENDLY interaction......\"thank you sir it was a pleasure to serve you this morning, I hope you have a great day\".........EEEK!
3 ||| 7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great.... \n\nAll dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup... \nits new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P \n\nwalks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K... \n\nAs soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :) \n\nthe lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?! \n\nin the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed... \n\nas soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said \"Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?\" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? \"um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... \" he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird \n\nhe got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score! \n\nonce we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing... \nhe had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli... \n\nso the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm \n\nthen he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!? \n\nonce we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying \"pardon me or excuse me\" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified! \n\nEnd Result.... \n\nGood Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :) \nThe Service was nice... \nNice atmosphere... \nHorrible date... \nWish i had had better company :( \n\noh and i Tossed out his number...
2 ||| It was just ok.  For 200 bucks (lots of taxes boost the price by about 25 bucks a night), you get a decent sized room and a comfortable bed.  \n\nIf you don't put \"do not disturb\" on your door, the housekeeping knocks at 8:30 to come in and clean.  I put the sign on, and somehow it got changed to \"No housekeeping\" sign, which if you request you get a 5 dollar gift card to use at the hotel.  I wanted housekeeping, just not at 8:30 am.  On the day they did come in, toiletries were not replaced.   I did get more coffee, but not more shampoo.  I like that the coffee maker is in the main room, not the bathroom, and there is nothing to clean, it takes pods.  The ice bucket and glasses are in the bathroom, yuck.  There is no fridge.  The heating/cooling unit runs constantly and is loud.  You can clearly hear every door slamming in the hall and the showers and toilets being used on each side of you.\n\nThe conference I went to at the hotel went smoothly, and it was convenient to stay there.  The food is not great, and they need to provide protein with the breakfast, not everybody is a carb fiend.  I had the vegetarian lunch of pasta, it was terrible, and a boxed lunch that was equally as bad.  I wouldn't recommend eating at the hotel.  \n\nI stayed 3 nights, at the discounted conference rate, and it came to 612 bucks.
1 ||| Loud, leaking faucet. Lightbulbs out in bedroom. Peep glass in door broken. Just an old Embassy Suites type hotel at a higher rate. I'll stay a\nMarriott gal.
0 ||| My colleague put in an order for lunch and I decided to order with her. When the order arrived, I received the wrong item and my colleague didn't receive the chips that came with her basket. We called back and asked for them to correct the order. We were given no apology, just a \"well I don't know when the driver is going to be able to come back\". When they did come back, my correct order was drenched in salad dressing, so much that it was coming out of both the packaging it was wrapped in as well as the carry-out bag. It was inedible. Furthermore, my colleague's chips were completely smashed (there was a hole in the bag like someone had popped it and when she opened it the chips were nothing but crumbs). It almost seems like it was all done on purpose. First and last time I'll be eating Dilly's Deli.
2 ||| I was very happy with my calamari taco. It had just the right amount of flavor and it was a nice break from more traditional seafood or Mexican. I'd probably go back next time I'm in Charlotte.
1 ||| Stopped in yesterday for a quick lunch with the kids after a visit to the Science Center.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Worst experience as a mom ever!!  The waitress, Abriana, did not have customer service skills whatsoever.  Our orders came out incorrect, figures since she didn't even write them down.  After we informed her that the orders were wrong, she proceeded to tell us that we were wrong and this is what we ordered.  Kids have been waiting almost 35 minutes for the food now.  We had the manager come over.  He apologized for the error and waited on us the rest of the visit. Food was good, but the service was not up to par.  We would not go back.
4 ||| I bought my wife's engagement ring here about a year ago. Designed it with the onsite jewelers and felt very happy the entire time. I picked the ring up and there was a huge mistake. No big deal, they said it will be fixed. The problem was that I needed it that day for a trip I wS taking and planned proposing. Again, no problem. We will get it done. They did, and ever since that point have offered great device. Bought our wedding rings here as well. I recommend this place to many people and nobody has been disappointed.
4 ||| Let me just preface by saying that I am very picky about my bagels and bagel shops. I used to work at a wonderful shop with great bagels back in the day. It's been hard to find a good bagel in the valley since.\n\nMy husband and I were in the mood for some bagel sandwiches. After being disappointed with the bagel shop selections located around us, we were determined to try to find \"the one\". After scoping out Yelp, seeing it was close-by and had great reviews we decided to try Lox, Stock & Bagel.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in we were greeted by Patrick, Michelle and staff I knew we hit the jackpot. They were so personable and friendly, honored our Yelp 6 free bagels without question and were super patient with our large order.\n\nAs for the menu, lots of selection! Our food arrived in the right amount of time AND the whole wheat mixed bagel is nothing short of incredible!\n\nLoved the chill, comfy atmosphere. (although, I'm not going to lie--the big mirrors on the wall need to go!)\n\nWe will definitely be back--with our 3 1/2 year old, since there was plenty of kid toys to keep him busy while we take our time eating. \n\nCan't wait to try one of the bagels we brought home for breakfast tomorrow morning!
1 ||| If I was just rating the magnificent space I would give The Grand Course more than 5 stars, but unfortunately this rating is for the food and I am compelled to not give the restaurant anymore than 2 stars.\n\nWhat a shame that the most beautiful room in Pittsburgh does not have food that is on par with the stunning architecture.\n\nDo I recommend going there?  Absolutely yes, for drinks or desert to sit in the grandeur of the main room, but not for a full meal.  I have eaten Brunch, Lunch and Dinner twice here in the past month and the food is consistently mediocre and greasy.  Yesterday I went for brunch at 1pm.  The food was horribly picked over and not replenished, most of the food was just the remains of what had been sitting out for too long.  They did eventually replenish the food, but after we had all eaten.  They shouldn't wait until every last drop has been eaten, it should be a constant process of making the food look presentable.  Most of the cooked foods were too greasy and overcooked.  The Omelette bar was instead a big griddle where the cook was pouring out long strips of egg enough for 10 omelets or so.  Then he'd put your toppings onto a section and would cut it off for you.  Because the omelets were not individually made to order in separate frying pans, by the time you got your omelette the cheese wasn't melted, the toppings weren't cooked and it was like rubber, I took one bite and that was that.  \n\nI took a friend here for her birthday and was truly embarrassed by the whole experience.  My friend's son is a chef at a famous restaurant in a large city.  I kept feeling like I had to apologize for how awful the food was.  Why is this not on par with a classic Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons brunch experience?  Instead it feels like a brunch that's a bit better than a college cafeteria.  Most of the main food is cramped into a small side area with deserts being spread out to the other side of the room.  They should create a larger dedicated space for brunch where everyone is not cramped like sardines into such a small unimpressive area.  I know they have a private room adjacent to the main room, this would work perfectly, but of course then it would be much more obvious how few choices there really are.  The best thing about desert was the homemade donut making machine.  If you wait you can watch your donut being made from start to finish, brilliant!  The English Trifle was awful.  It would be better to not serve something that is such a traditional dish if you don't at least look at a recipe for how to make one.  I have had trifles all over the world and this takes the cake for the worst one ever.\n\nI wish that I could say this place was fantastic all around, but it is not.  The room is already fantastic.  It's time to take charge and get the food up to par.
1 ||| Located right across from Symphony Hall, we decided to have a drink before a show.   Networks was not that busy with many watching the games on the flat screens.  We sat there for about 5 minutes, no one came by to greet us or take our orders so we moved to the bar and had a quick drink.  Not my first place for a drink downtown!
2 ||| they have pretty good cookies, i know there are allot better options in my neighborhood for some cookies. but if i'm downtown in the mix and they are open, i might grab a snickerdoodle or a Chocolate Macadamia
4 ||| For 14 years I have loved everything about this place.  It is always GREAT, from the food to the beer to the service.  The dedication to this craft for 14 years takes a very special crew of people.  I Love this place.
1 ||| I'm always amazed at anthropomorphism when it comes to eateries it just seems in such bad taste but  when it comes down it I voluntary  entered a pink building with metal siding  so any pretense I had re concerning aesthetics is rather lacking in credibility. Yes there are a lot of pigs just don't think about it too much while eating.  This was a quick lunch stop  2pm in the afternoon and the place was quiet.  \n\nDidn't get appetizers.  Service was quick and ordering  was easy.  Pork sandwich and a hot link sandwich.   Food came out quickly. \n\n The BBQ beans are claimed to be  made in house but the way they make them seems  to resemble that which came out a manufacturing plant. I'm not saying they aren't made at \"home\"  maybe that they just shouldn't go to the effort for the result.   These were a mass disappointment and  would be my reason to exclude them from further visits. \n\nThe hot link sausage and sauce on an onion bun was  again not that bad but not going  go out my way to get it again.  Cornbread,  really good,  BBQ pork sandwich  that my partner had was pretty good.  \n\nSoda was refilled and had the syrup balance  done well. Nowhere close to RUB in Vegas,  or  even El Paso which is a shame since the price difference isn't that great and the food is average -  ouch  for the type. \n\n I stayed in GA my first years here in the states and I have to say that  while this is Ok  for lunch if you are near it  I can't see  El Paso   knocking it out of my local bbq fix.  So my search for great BBQ in  Phoenix goes on..
0 ||| They have the worst customer service ever. My Internet only works about half the time. I've been complaining for three months now. It has taken this long to schedule a technician that can fit with my work schedule. The cable package I have was misrepresented by the sales lady and is a ripoff, plus it doesn't always work either. I finally have an appointment for someone to come look at it, but they said they will have to charge me most likely. The customer service reps are not empathetic and they have not offered me any compensation for the bad service. I pay over $80 a month for Internet and local channels in SD only. No HD and the same channels an antenna picks up. I've lived in many cities, and Cox is by far the most expensive cable provider I have had and the worst service and customer service. They also do not care about you as a customer.
3 ||| This place is down the street from me and it's kind of addictive.  I really like the assorted Tong Mein (noodle soups).  They come with various combinations of beef, pork, ginger, scallions, and two kinds of dumplings (wonton or gyoza), a big pile of stringy noodles (think Chinese angel hair pasta), and broth.  One soup with an appetizer or two can feed a couple people, but we've been known to order one soup per person in response to strong Wah Kee cravings.  The menu is huge, but I've not strayed from the Tong Mein much at all.  It's dang good.  Not sure if I would order for regular junk Chinese food, but definitely worth it for the soup.
4 ||| If you are looking for a place that have consistently fed the local community and tourists with their down-to-earth pizzas and other items on the menu for decades, this is definitely the spot! We were introduced to Boston Pizza by a local friend and it turns out to be a LV local gem! We ordered large Meatlovers and they were simply wonderful: generous size, generous toppings, easy salt, thick pizza but easy on the dough, perfectly balanced sauce and cheese and other toppings to ensure beautiful texture and taste. One caution for the pretentious few: this place is very fast-paced because they are all busy making or delivering fresh, hot pizzas and other items around Las Vegas, so if you need crushed pepper and cheese packets or extra napkins, simply speak up and they will take care of you in no time. Will definitely go back there again this coming week!

0 ||| Absolutely horrible customer service!  The worst Best Buy I have ever visited.  My family shops at Best Buy from Wilmington to Johnson City and this is by far the worst place we have ever been.  I don't usually write these but they irratated me to no end not once, not twice but three times.  It started last year when I purchased a new laptop to replace my 4 yr old one (which I also bought at Best Buy).  The Geek squad did not listen to my concerns and wiped my old laptop clean WITHOUT contacting me as they stated they would.  I lost a lot of important information!  Then stating that both my computers were ready (while contacting the wrong person over and over again).  When we went to pick them up they were not ready, and this happened 3 times.  Back and forth a total waste of time. THEN guess what happens a year later, THE SAME THING!! After having to wait for 45 mins for them to even find me in their system (I had spent the extra money on the one year plan-which they magically couldn't find 6 months later).  Still no contact to pick up my computer 7 days later, after they stated it was ready and guess what happened after i drove out of my way, it wasn't! Their response \"Oh, huh I don't know what happened there!\" not even an apology. Called again 3 days later to check and oh all of a sudden it was ready just that second.  Only to find out that it wasn't installed properly BY THE GEEK SQUAD to begin with which is why it messed up. Total lack of respect for customers and total idiots that obviously cannot read directions and dial a phone number correctly!
2 ||| The only reason I really go here is when I'm on my boat and get hungry, and this is one of the few boat-up bar/restaurants in the city.  The complete lack of boat+drink+food spots in this city should be the subject of another post.  \n\nAlthough this place has a lot of potential, the beer list is lacking and comparatively expensive.  The food is mediocre generally, though I did get a pretty decent fish sandwich last time I was here.  I've had several of their apps, and none of them were worth writing home about.  \n\nCome here if you're looking for a \"chill\" environment, good patio dining, and a nice view of the river.  If you're only looking for a good meal, I definitely don't recommend it.
2 ||| The Brisket and pulled pork were my favorite. Tried the ribs and cut up hot links in the sauce and it was not to bad. Huge portions and tasty baked beans. When I got home to dig into my Mac and cheese, I opened the plate to see Mac salad instead. I was pissed because the Mac n cheese looked so good. I drove kind of far and did not want to go back.
3 ||| Traveling across the country and stopped in Pittsburgh for the night. The guy at the hotel suggested Sharp Edge and to make sure we tried the Mediterranean Nachos. \n\nThe beers were great! The food was great--everyone really enjoyed their food... and the Mediterranean Nachos? F'ing fantastic!  Our waitress was very pleasant, but kept changing her accent every time she came to the table. Not sure if she was bored and passing the time, or if she was messing with us.\n\nThe place was busy for a Tuesday night and everyone was having a great time. It had the feel of a really great local hangout.  Warm, comfortable, and inviting.\n\nIf/When I get back to Pittsburgh, I will definitely come back--if only for those nachos.
3 ||| Great authentic Mexican food. It was very hole in the wall and place and looked dirty but the food was great!! The tortillas were the best I've ever had at a restaurant. It wasn't located in the best of locations, but next time I'm in Phoenix I'll be sure to stop by.
2 ||| As I've mentioned in many of my other reviews, I'm not a big salad person. I almost always choose a sandwich, soup or entree over a salad, even for lunch. Given that, I always appreciate a salad that has some substance to it--if there are hearty ingredients paired with the lettuce and/or there are generous portions of these mix-ins, I'm likely to be a fan (even if I'd still order a sandwich nine times out of ten!). \n\nThe seafood cake salad I had at Taylor's definitely met my standards for a good salad. There were a ton of greens and the seafood cakes that came on top of the salad were both flavorful and well-sized. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when the salad protein is such a small portion that you have to carefully meter out enough bites to last through the whole salad. I don't know about you, but at lunch, I want to eat not think. Agree with other reviewers that the salads at Taylor's are pricey but this is logical given their size. \n\nOne thing I was really unenthusiastic about at Taylor's? The incredibly chilly and relatively unattentive service. I don't need a bubbly server who is constantly in my face or spewing out niceties, but I wouldn't mind someone who at least pretends to give a rat's ass about the job (or if they can't muster that, at least gets me what I need when I need it). \n\nIf you want a big and tasty salad, check out Taylor's--but don't go expecting friendly service.
4 ||| Everything about this place is pretty dam good. I haven't one thing that didn't impress me. Also you can't beat $5.99 for a Gyros, frys, and a drink. Also had their hummus is really really good, Highly recommend this place.
1 ||| I don't particularly like chain restaurants, but when getting a relatively large family together, sometimes a chain is the only way to go.  California Pizza Kitchen is a frequent choice for our family, as we all have various dietary restrictions that this restaurant can easily accommodate.\n\nThe gem (and the drawback) of this place is consistency.  The food is consistently good (not great, but not mediocre).  The service is consistently bad, mediocre on a good day.\n\nOur most recent trip resulted in a dinner mistake that both the server and the manager defended, though it was clear that a mistake had been made.  This is not the first time that I've been on the receiving end of that type of conversation, and it makes me wonder just what makes the staff here so condescending to the needs and requests of customers.\n\nMy aunt ordered a pizza Margherita, but asked for sliced tomatoes on top in lieu of the sauce.  If the staff spoke the lingo of New York-style pizza restaurants, she would have ordered a white pizza with sliced tomatoes.  Regardless, she was incredibly clear with the waitress what she wanted, and her order was repeated back verbatim.  The five of us at the table all believed that everyone was on the same page.\n\nHowever, when the food actually came out, it was clear that our server was not on the same page as our family.  She explained that, upon placing the order for the pizza, that the tomatoes normally on the pizza (a diced variety, supposedly part of a \"chunky sauce\") WERE the sauce, so she had the kitchen go ahead and make the pizza without tomatoes.  \"Was that okay?\" she asked, apparently suddenly unsure of her decision as she was just now bringing everyone our food.\n\nFirst, the decision was contrary to what my aunt had asked for.  She asked for tomatoes, but no sauce.  While the kitchen may put diced tomatoes on this particular pizza, I have ordered varieties of pizza at that very restaurant before with sliced tomatoes (the requested substitution).  I'm not sure why sliced tomatoes were impossible, but they were.  Furthermore, it is up to the server to communicate about substitutions with the kitchen.  It seems that, had she done a bit more probing, she could have had the right pizza brought out the first time.\n\nSecond, if the kitchen is somehow completely unable to make that kind of pizza, she should check with the table BEFORE putting the order through.  Her decision to just wait until the order was out left my aunt waiting an additional twenty minutes for another pizza to be made.  Our experience would have been totally different if she had spent 45 seconds checking back in with us to communicate about what our options really were.\n\nWhen the manager was brought over, he asserted the server's story that the tomatoes are part of the sauce, and because my aunt asked for \"tomatoes but no sauce,\" the kitchen went ahead and made the pizza without the sauce.  Only after a few minutes of discussion did he offer to have the pizza re-made with diced tomatoes.\n\nWhile they attempted to rectify it by comping the pizza, the damage had been done; our experience had been ruined by our server's decision to not confirm her understanding of my aunt's request.\n\nI wouldn't rate this a two-star restaurant if I hadn't had SEVERAL similar experiences here.  It must be the management, as other CPKs that I've visited throughout the valley are quite good.
0 ||| I went the the AHWATUKEE Best Best in Phx, Az and hear is my horror story.\n\nI got a new number and cell HTC One using Sprint and first off it did not work when I left the store, I went back and waited another 30 mins for them to activated it and got home to find out they didn't turn on some features I asked for.\n\nThen the next day an update pop up and I updated it and the next time I used the phone it would echo on the other end and would cracky on my end. So I took the phone back and told them what was going on and guess what they asked me? \"What do you want me it do about it?\" I said fix it. I could not believe she said that to a customer, So they gave me a new one while being rude to me.\n\nSo a few days later I get this update again and not even thinking that the first update on the first one was the issue I updated the software and guess what? Turns out the phone did the same thing. So I call sprit and their 1st level of tech support could not figure it out and got me a ticket for 2nd level support that I had to wait at least 48hrs, So about 5 days later or so I get a text on Sat saying to call M-F about my ticket. So Monday I call the 2nd level tech support and turns out that out of 1000's of HTC One cells only less then 100 was having the same issue as I was, to low to make a big deal of it. They said its the software update not working with the phone and to take it back to see if they can reinstall the older software or get a different phone.\n\nSo back to Best Buy I go today to find out the only thing out of their mouth was its past the 15 day return there is nothing we can do. I asked for his boss and he said they same thing. I told him I have a trail of paper work shown issues about this type of phone from Sprint, but they did not care. So I am standing there with a broken phone I got from Best buy with no customer support on their end. They would not turn a wrong into a right, they would not lift one finger to help me out. I felt small and like they didn't care about me, They already got my money is what they cared about. I own a company and if I treated my customers like this I would be out of business. So I asked for the GM and he said Im him and nothing I can do. So I walk out the door!!!\n\nSo I drove to Sprint and clam down some, And for the first time in over a year I got a good Sprint rep and I knew he really could not help me because I did not buy the phone from sprint but I wanted to heard all my options. They gave me an option to leave it and to get tested out and if something was wrong I would have to pay $75 for another HTC one. I did not want that phone again. So he said I should go back to Best buy and go to the Greek Squad. He also ask why I did not buy my phone from them. I told him each time I cam in I had to wait about an hour to get a very rude rep, but I told him at least they treated him better the Best Buy..,lol. But he was very nice and helpful, they are those few people in big companies that do care and he was one of them.\n\nSo my wife said to go to Chandler mall's Best Buy , so I went over there very clam and went right away to the Geek Squad and explained all I been through. Then he said you know what, you proven your phone as not been working right\nand asked for a manager to come over, we both explain to him what happen and he look at all the paper work I had and said I CAN HELP YOU. I was in shock!! Turns out the Phx Best Buy store could have exchanged my phone with no issues, but they are lazy. He used my 2nd exchange as the starting date that would have ended tomorrow for the 15 day return. He took me over to the cell phone people and told them to take good care of me and show me other phones.\n\nI walk out the Chandler Malls Best Buy very happy with a new S4 phone and not an crappy HTC broken one.\n\nThis proves that its not what a company saids and their polices. Its about the people that work there. The Phx store has poor customer services while the Chandler store has over the top customer service. It was day and night .\n\nI will never shop at Phx Best Buy again Please go to the Chandler Mall's Best Buy, its worth it!!!!\n\nAnd do not buy the HTC ONE
2 ||| Good place  if you like spicy Mexican!  I had dinner here with some colleagues on a work trip and all of the food was really spicy. Thankfully, we all had margaritas that toned down the heat. Overall, huge place, nice atmosphere, Margaritas were really good, too much spice on food. Will come back next time I'm in the area but with more attention paid to the ingredients next time!
4 ||| The owner and her parents are delightful, helpful and kind. I often stop in here for a little treat or blast from the past. I grew up in England and love that I can buy chocolates that I loved as a child. If you need a recommendation or a gift, they are always willing to help you choose something or put together a little gift basket within your price range.
0 ||| This was the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. I never even got into the room. Checked in to room 287 and went to the room. Key didn't work. Called the desk and they said come get new keys. Ok. Carry my stuff back down get new keys and they still don't work. Let's call the maintenance guy... Too late. I am out!
3 ||| Service was slow, but that was because one of our party insisted that the bartender, her favorite server, serve us in our private room for a party of 8.  The food and drinks were good and we woud return.
4 ||| I dined with a colleague and we were able to walk in and grab a seat immediately. We started out with the fried pickles which had a slight kick to them. Nothing that's going to burn your mouth but just enough to let you know it's there.  The portion is perfect for a table of 2-4 to share. \n\nFor the entree I ordered a burger and a hot dog. It was hard to pick from the great options but I ended up getting the Winky Dinky Dog and the Small Block Burger.  The chili and pimento cheese on the Winky complimented each other nicely and came together for a really tasty dog. I also requested pimento cheese on the burger and I'm glad I did. The food all around was really good!
0 ||| We were hungry and I was thinking Chili's would be much like Applebee's. You know great food and service? Well boy was I wrong. \nThe restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk. We were hungry and ordered \nNachos. Seems like an easy plate to make, but they bring us 5 chips (no kidding!) with beans and cheese on them (sort of like mini cheese crisps). The presentation was horrible, they tasted even worse. I end up ordering a chicken salad and my friend something like a rice black bean bowl. I was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse. Just wilted lettuce and chicken (that tasted like it was old). I ate two bites and had had enough. The waitress had no desire to provide us with any level of service and kept on coming back to us almost rushing us to leave. This was almost the worse dining experience ever! Stay Away! $30 for a awful appetizer and two entrees. Never again.
1 ||| The service was spot on. I was taking my food to go and they got my order right along with a place setting. So no eating with my fingers this time; which is a nice change.\n\nI use to always get the mac and cheese with extra cheese an extra meat. It was my one guilty....really guilty pleasure in my stop over here. For some reason it just was not hitting the spot with me. It use to hae this really creamy cheese sauce that went with it and of course topped with shredded cheese. \n\nI got back to my hotel, putting the bag of yum on the floor board with the heat blasted to make sure my yum stayed warm and gooey....but then...I get back to my room open up the lit to start the hunt for my goo...where was it!!!!! Frankly it was nowhere to be found. That is right, it is as if they boiled some elbow macaroni slapped it in a bowl, threw some meat and cheese on the top and called it a day.\n\nSo disappointing that I skipped my mac an cheese and moved on to the rice krispy hunk that I got; which was hard as a rock. Very disappointing. The good news is it kept me from wracking up an insane amount of calories because frankly it just was not worth it.
0 ||| We were excited to go to the Ranch House as we have heard they had excellent steak. Arrived on Christmas Eve for our dinner reservation and the manager was very rude and abrupt. We were sat at the table by the kitchen where the employees kept walking by and leaning into us the entire duration of our meal. It was like our family being at that table was a huge Inconvience. Finally, our steaks arrived. Everyone was starving so when we all cut into our steaks expecting to bite into a juicy steak boy were we surprised! EVERY steak was over cooked and tough! I could see if we ordered our steaks well done but the steaks were ordered to be medium rare to medium.  On there behave one steak was sent back and they did cook another steak but it took 30 minutes and everyone was already done with their dinner. The manager continued to circle and watch during this time because he wanted our table.  I hate to complain but EVERYONE at the other tables was having the same complaint OVER COOKED MEAT.  Between the rude manager, horrible and expensive food, the building/bathroom was in serious disrepair. I honestly can't believe this place is still in business. I will NEVER be back. If you read this and are deciding to come here PLEASE take your business else where as, YES, it was that BAD!!!!
3 ||| Apple has a way of being unconventionally cool that borders on tragically hip. \n\nCase in point, every time I go, I get sucked in for way longer than I'm supposed to be there. On top of that, the Apple brand's surge in popularity since the release of the first generation iPod (which is still what I'm rocking, by the way. Battery Life - 2 minutes, 14 seconds) makes it nearly impossible to get in and get out with whatever it is you need in the amount of time you probably allotted. The geniuses at the genius bar are helpful but wait time is usually well over twenty minutes. \n\nThe one in the Biltmore is not quite as cool as the one in NYC, but it's still pretty BA (sorry for using harsh letters).
1 ||| This Walgreens has everything and is nicely designed and way easier to move through than any other Walgreens I have been to. And if I were reviewing just the store I would say it was fantastic.\nBut my experience focused primarily on the take care clinic and it's inefficiency. I was needing a physical for employment and despite having to pay out of pocket, I thought this would be far more convenient than going to a primary care doctor. \nI checked in and waited about a half hour (which wasn't very long). I was than greeted by someone (I have no idea if he was a doctor, a nurse or the receptionist). This person never introduced himself, walked me into a room with someone else's stuff. He was a young guy in his 20s with clearly very little professional experience. When I told him I wanted a physical, he let out a big sigh as if I was causing him an inconvenience. He asked me why I hasn't filled out paperwork (which were nowhere to be seen) and grabbed the papers I had brought (for the physical). He stared at the papers and  looked at them as if they were written in a foreign language. He let out another sigh. It was at this point that he wanted to start the exam, but it was also at this point that I decided I wasn't comfortable with this person ( who was frazzled, unprofessional and still hadn't introduced himself to me). My five minutes with him felt more like talking to someone from the ghetto than someone supposed to be in the medical profession and I had no intention of this person examining me! Skip this place and make an appointment somewhere  else!
0 ||| This is NOT NY PIZZA!\n\nI came here only once for lunch, and tried the pizza here for the first time. 2 slices of sausage, and a dinner salad. Both slices were thicker than your basic delivery chain pizza. The pizza was very thick crust, puffy and chewy, and the sausage was little balls of meat that tasted like it was from a frozen pizza. \n\nOverall the pizza was NOT very good!\n\nThis place should never call itself a NY Pizza joint. Thick crust IS NOT NY PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nWow it's truly is a crime to call this NY Pizza!
3 ||| I always find it reassuring when I pull up to a Mexican restaurant that there's a bunch of landscaping trucks parked and the guys are inside eating lunch :)  I thought Mixteca did a pretty good job with my carne asada tacos, rice and beans were not a complete afterthought, decent chips and salsa bar.  The staff was friendly (they actually SMILED).\nI was about to get a little p.o.'d when my taco platter and small Diet Coke was more than nine dollars but rest assured the portions are by no means skimpy.  The decor was typical fresh-Mex beach type, I could certainly see myself enjoying a cerveza on the large patio when the sub-100 degree days resume!
3 ||| I want to review the salon there, particularly Kristina.  When I walked in, I told her that she could do whatever she wanted to with my hair, and just gave her a few basic guidelines.  My cut turned out amazing!  I now have this punky choppy awesome cut, which I love and get compliments on all the time!  She is not the super chatty or gossipy type, which is fine with me - though I know some want that from their stylist.  Also, she is not as good with color as she is with cutting, but with suggestions from the other stylists my color turned out great as well.
4 ||| The staff was very friendly.  Dr. Podloski is fantastic!  They help me get a new pair of sunglasses.  I thought the name brands they carry is much better than some of the other places in town.  Thanks!!
0 ||| We ate here on Thursday night recently at 9pm.  We were planning on going to Ichiza in the same complex, but we were craving Korean BBQ.  \n\nI had my suspicions about this place before I even walked through the door... The place was dead.  The place is very spacious, but there was just one other table and they were just wrapping up.  We should of left, but we really wanted bbq.  \n\nI'm not Korean, but I've had my fair share in Seattle.  We didn't get the All-You-Can-Eat, so maybe that's a better experience.  I doubt it though.  As others have said the food was bland or over seasoned.  We had japche, bulgogi, dolsot bibimbap, and soon du boo.  Everything tasted \"off\".  \n\nI'm sorry but this place was just awful.  I wish I checked reviews before we went!
0 ||| Stay away from this place!  They talk people into services that are not required. They use scare tactics to get women to pay for services not needed. These people have no conscious! \n\nDo yourself a favor and go somewhere else!
0 ||| Yo fuck this Cab company. My friend left his wallet in the cab. Called back less than 5 mins later and they refused to connect him with the cabbie or call the cabbie for him. Told him to \"call back in the morning.\" These people don't want your business otherwise they wouldn't treat their customers this way.  DO NOT CALL YELLOW CAB!!!!!!
3 ||| Interesting art museum with some good stuff by native Americans and others. Although the focus is on art and culture of the southwest, there are small displays from other  parts of the world. We have been there before but what drew us back is a Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit related to her landscape and katsina doll work. Unfortunately that is not her best work though it was still interesting. There is always something new. We will never be regular visitors but it is worth going at least once a year. The cafe adds to the experience. The gift shop and the book shop are pretty good too.
2 ||| I love the theme of this place with gourmet snacks, coffee, tea, condiments, beer, wine, glassware, etc.  Prices aren't bad either.  The thing that holds this place back is the location in a small parking lot adjacent to Old Navy, and they keep all of their beer at room temperature.  Since much of it is slow moving, that means it is at room temperature for a long time, which can easily result in bad beers.\n\nCustomer service is usually good here for me.  I'll continue going, but only at off-peak times to avoid the annoying Old Navy people that fill the lot.
4 ||| Great at remember that I had just been there the prior day and know what I wanted.  Lovely service
4 ||| Two words- Smokey Forest.
4 ||| Great Fabric Store with Great low prices! Mostly everything is $8.99 a yard. Plus they give out great ideas and advice.
1 ||| The only reason I gave this Starbucks 2 stars as opposed to 1 is because they have a drivethru.\n\nI liked this Starbucks before they moved to the new location.  The old location would usually be moderately busy. But not like it is now.  Every time I visit this Starbucks, it is completely slammed.  Being busy isn't the problem, it's the size of the interior.  This Starbucks has people squished in like sardines....they have huge tables that almost always have one person sitting at them with their laptop and schoolbooks spread out.  I can never find a seat and no one EVER LEAVES.  I think they need to have a time limit for people who sit there all day.\n\nThe employees all look stressed, I assume because this is the busiest Starbucks in Charlotte.  They are usually friendly though.  \n\nI would avoid this Starbucks and hit the one on Mallard Creek or Davis Creek roads.
2 ||| Good Brews, nice ambiance, good food, but Kitchen Staff needs a tune-up as the Burrito Special came out barely warm\nthe same as the side of rice.  Had to be sent back to get food to serving temperature.  Will be back.
0 ||| I went in because my primary care physician referred me to a dermatologist due to weird reactions to a procedure I received(from somewhere else). Unfortunately I was misinformed by my primacy care physician and should have seen an allergist instead of a dermatologist. Not LVSCC fault. My problem was the PA I saw was a guy who obviously doesn't really care about people or his job. I had to switch my work schedule and inconveniently go there and instead of him sympathizing he rolled his eyes and acted like a jerk. Then pretty much told me I'm wasting my time trying to figure out what happened to my skin and what I'm allergic to. Which is odd because my entire job is skincare and to take care of it so why wouldn't I want to figure that out? I specifically mentioned that I'm an aesthetician. When he walked out he just yelled at his front desk staff \"IM NOT AN ALLERGIST CANT HELP HER\". This entire situation could have been handled differently and if he would have been respectful I wouldn't have been so pissed to waste my time. Instead he's a brat and I'm going out of my way to write this post. Which I never usually do. \n\n\n\nAs an aesthetician I can recommend dermatologists for my clients to see because they ask me all the time. I will never recommend anyone to go here. The only reason there is 1 star is because 1 out of the 5 front desk girls was polite and actually seemed nice, and it's the lowest rating they can receive.
1 ||| Old Spaghetti Factory: the place where fat suburbanites bring their fat children to eat fatty, salty and bland pasta.  The parking lot is a Camry convention and the client\u00e8le is as white as the bread that they serve with your meals.\n\nOn the plus side, kids love the trolley and they get to ring the bell when they finish eating.  Always good motivation.
1 ||| Been here before and it was WAY better than this last Thursday! Had veggie/hummus appetizer, burger that was ok, had one porter and one hefe and both were sub par, but the root beer float was the best thing I had even if I only got one scoop of ice cream...last time was the last time.
0 ||| Don't use these guys unless you make an appointment with the dispatcher.   Made arrangements with two different drivers and both times I was stood up.\nWould never use them again.
3 ||| I stopped here with my dad for a quick dinner. It took longer than expected to get two half sandwiches and two half salads, but it was worth the wait. Dilly's Deli has great sandwiches made with fresh ingredients. This place had very little decor and felt a little plain and empty. They did have some neat art painted on the walls though. They need to add some thing on the walls and tables. Maybe a few plants around the place (fake ones would work too). Overall, we were pleased with our meal and would recommend it.
2 ||| This is literally a whole in the wall of a bar. Small and usually packed after midnight. It's the place were the drunks stumble to from all the other bars on Montford in order to sing Karaoke.  \n\nThey have gotten their liquor license back but the smell of stagnant water & beer is still there.   they even serve food though I have never been bold enough to try it. \n\nIf you have never been, it is definitely an experience you must try, at least once. If you are young and out to party, this should be a stop on the Montford crawl.
2 ||| The service here is fast and friendly, and they offer lots of services.\n\nThe major downside is their pricing. I had two copies made (~10 pages total) and got one item notarized. This cost me over $11. The notary fee was $.50, the copies a few cents, and then there was a $10 facility fee. What does that mean? Because I walked in I had to pay $10? Is it their way of charging more for notary fees? I'm not sure, but I was a bit disappointed.\n\nStill, it was convenient, especially as it was 8 am and most banks or other locations that could have done notary services for me were not open yet.
4 ||| Anita's Cocina is by far is Wickenburg's best restaurant! They have great food, large menu to select from, very friendly staff and a great atmosphere.
3 ||| Excellent, excellent food! Very reasonable also. I would highly recommend to give this place a try. I had the veggie eggs Benedict on an English muffin. Fantastic! They offer dishes like salmon omlettes, salmon eggs Benedict, etc. Very good quality for an airport diner.
3 ||| my friends at Pittsburgh said that it must a try! that was I went there! I had an steak sandwich, greasy but delicious and with the fries and slaw are on the sandwich! which was strange! It was not easy to eat it, but it was fun! apparently pitts folks really love fries :)
3 ||| Overall I am happy with Pure Fitness.  I've belonged to 24 Hour off and on over the years and I am definitely more comfortable at Pure Fitness.....no 'scene' to deal with here.  Memberships are fairly priced, the Shea location is huge and very clean.  The trainers are a little aggressive, but that's how they make their money. Also, I do wish they offered more group exercise classes and some spinning classes.  If you're looking for a clean, modern place to just work out I highly recommend checking them out.
3 ||| Wow, I was pleasantly surprised when I met up some friends here. And I've been back several more times since.  This isn't some dirty little bar, as though it may provoke you to think that.  The food is GREAT!!  Big portions, easy on the wallet, I would totally recommend this place for late night eating.
3 ||| I'm pretty much a pho expert.  Maybe not certifiable, but pretty close.  I wasn't sure what Tram's would have to offer in terms of authentic pho- but it's the real deal. The rundown:\n\nI ordered two of the pork & shrimp spring rolls- delish!  I've had better peanut sauce, but the rolls were great.   Then I ordered the beef pho.  The broth was incredible- ridiculously hot (temp) with onions, just the way it should be.  The beef was probably too well done for my taste and was cooked all the way through when the soup was brought to me.  But it tasted just fine.  Only complaint was that the basil that came on the side wasn't very fresh. \n\nOverall, it was great. Def going back.... and Tram is a nice guy.
2 ||| I would of gave this place either 4-5 stars if it wasn't for the mute, slow service. I must admit though, their interior design makes this pho restaurant upscale than others. I've been to a good amount of pho restaurants here in Las Vegas and if you have too then you know that pho & drinks are served to you pretty fast.\n\nNow before I go on to my little rant, I must add that their pho is never a disappointment. What I always get is number 13 which is the combination pho which has a little bit of most things & the steak is flavorful. So good job Pho Kim Long for yummy pho ! But BOO for the lack of service you offer ! \n\nMy boyfriend and I went and we ordered two #13 combination phos and I also ordered a tai tea boba. About 3 minutes later our pho is served to us but not my drink. You would of thought my drink came first, right? Well, I thought, \"Oh, maybe they're still making it\" so about another good 5 minutes passes by & my boba is still not served to me & I started to question my thoughts about this place. So we asked one of the waiters where my boba was and he just walked off without any acknowledgement or reassurance that it was coming. So we waited another 10 minutes and my boyfriend and I are just about done with our pho and still....no....tai tea boba. I asked another waiter, \"Hi excuse me, I've been waiting for about 10 minutes for my tai tea boba now and I still haven't gotten it.\" & he got the job done but he didn't even apologize for the long wait. \n\nI got my boba just in time we paid for the check and the boba was great but ugh the service is whack. I need I add that we did go there during graveyard hours but still, you can't lack on a job especially if it runs 24/7 and stays busy.
3 ||| Went to have a late breakfast at about 9:30 P.M. Chicken Florentine Crepes were amazing and service was still spot on. Usually that late at night the service tends to wain. Good job and great food.
1 ||| Food is okay, nothing exceptional in my opinion, but the staff has an attitude, picked up lunch two days in a row, hostess didn't say hello, or thank you, I said I was picking up, she handed me the bill and walked away, POOR service.
4 ||| I'm really surprised that the other reviewers had such a bad time in this store.   \n\nMy last carrier was Alltel, and Verizon gobbled them up this year.  Being a cell phone owner since the days when they came in a bag like a heavy small carry-on bag, I have to say I HAVE NEVER HAD A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE IN A CELL PHONE STORE BEFORE.   EVAH. \n\nI've had a Treo for many years.  Last year, I dropped the phone and broke the screen.   Went into the Alltel store and they literally said to me, \"sorry you're screwed; we don't replace screens; you have no insurance; you're still under contract\" - so my only solution was to buy a new one for $600 according to the very harried and unpleasant rotund pimply fellow at the Alltel store.   Methinks there must be another way!\n\nSo I got on line and found this PDAparts.com for replacement screens.   They warn you: this voids any warranty!!!   But it was \"only\" $70 so I went for it.  They actually have a step-by-step video posted on YouTube on how to replace the screen.  Scary, but my trusty friend/co-worker Chris is an engineer so he did the dirty work for me in about 5 minutes flat.  YAY.    Phone worked perfectly until.... one day... the screen just went blank.\n\nSo I'm hosed now right?  And it's December.   The phone technically still WORKED, as in: it rings, and I can fumble to answer it... but I can't see who's calling or who is texting me or make calls... or read my emails... so it was kinda limiting.\n\nSo with much trepidation I wandered myself over to the Verizon store on Camelback, figuring I was now only 1 month away from the end of my contract and maybe I just had to bite the bullet and switch to a new phone.    They don't make the Treo 755p anymore, and I really didn't want to learn how to use a whole new phone... too busy.  But I guess I gotta. \n\nSo you walk in and they ask you:  do you need service or sales, and what's your name?    Service... Jane.     They put you on a list which is on a big monitor, and tell you: you are 4th in line for service.   Sigh... look around... and not 5 minutes later, I'm called up. \n\nThe very friendly and CUTE guy who helped me took a look and agreed, the screen is fried.    Do you want to pick out a new phone today, or can you wait a few days to get a refurbished 755p?    Huh?  I could get another 755p?    Yes we will replace your phone but we don't have them HERE so you'd have to wait a few days.   Um... okay... I guess I can wait, but, how much will that cost?   \"Oh, it'll be free.\"    FREE?    Sold! \n\nThe people working there were joking around with each other, easy going and super helpful.  There were other people in the store who were clearly stressed and in a bad mood, and from what I observed these folks were super-great at defusing them. \n\nSomething good is going on at that shop and based on my experience (a) I highly recommend them; and (b) I'm sticking with Verizon!
2 ||| I can not say this place was horrible at all.  Besides some neighbors who don't care that they live in a community and not a private house, overall it was a good experience. The office staff could do more but I understand how it is to please so many.  Coming from PA to AZ and needing a affordable and close place from work without a long waiting period for approval, they were ok.  It is not the Ritz but it is clean and affordable.
4 ||| I've known Dr. Lokey for sometime as a business associate.  It is clear that she knows what she is talking about and cares about her patients.  If you have kids, they will receive great care from Dr. Lokey!
4 ||| Thanks to Tiffany I'm in love with my nails :-)\n\nBest nail quality in Vegas, So good that I don't want to share my secrets =-) If you go, ask for Tiffany and tell her Little Blonde Nikki sent you!!
2 ||| The Book Rack is squeezed in older shopper mall in Pineville, behind the Chili's and across from the Burlington Coat Factory.  While not a destination for used books, you can a decent mass market paperback for sale or a nearly new \"new\" book for around $7.\n\nI visit this store once in a while if I have nothing better to do.  Its geared toward female readers-every type of romance you can think of plus mysteries, popular literature, and some African-American and horror.  Mostly paperbacks.  The non-fiction section is an afterthought in the back of the store and not much better than a thrift store's selection in that dept.\n\nThe service is generally good.  I've had several positive experiences with a young clerk and a negative one with older crank....I mean, uh, clerk.  They can hold particular books for you if you're looking for a \"new\" book and they don't have a copy.  I asked them to call me if they got a particular book and they did a few weeks later!  Impressive.  Their book buying policy is convoluted-you get partial store credit and partial cash.  So if you try selling books, you gonna end up with store credit.  Hope you like Harlequin romances....
2 ||| = = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =\n\nFour and a half years after my last visit and Review of this Buffet I walked through the front door today and right into the Time Machine!!  My impressions of the place and the food were just about exactly the same, and it's even still the same price!\n\nTHE BEST:\n\n*  Comfortable, friendly atmosphere.\n\n*  Nice booth seating, with tables and chairs available as well.\n\n*  Reasonably priced for an Indian Buffet.\n\n*  Good tasting recipes, especially for those who like their Indian food mild.  (It's suitable for kids.)\n\n*  Indian Buffet standards Chicken Tikki Masala and Tandoori Chicken were both  present and tasting just right!\n\n*  Lamb Kheema.  Yay lamb!\n\n*  Tasty Chana Masala (Chick Pea Soup)!\n\n*  Unusual and good Bhaji (white mushrooms in a creamy sauce)!\n\n*  Chai (flavored hot tea) was included and good!\n\n= = = = = =\n\nTHE REST:\n\n*  Plain, dry Naan bread was served hot but blah tasting.  (I wasn't offered garlic flavored Naan.) \n\n*  Rather small Indian Buffet selection of about 16 items.\n\n*  Some of the hot dishes weren't up to proper temperature.\n\n= = = = = =\n\nSO,,,  It's exactly 3 Stars again for this \"OK\" $8.95 Indian Lunch Buffet.     :-)
1 ||| I'm changing my mind. I can do that. I can be conflicted. \n\nI don't know if I like this Border's anymore. I mean, its right around the corner, and its great if I need to pick something up for school or just some pleasure reading. But in the end, the employees, (except for my friend Siavonh), suck. Seriously. I've worked retail positions. I know how hard it can be to muster some enthusiasm around 4 o'clock. But its possible, so get real. Don't answer your phones with a crappy attitude, and DON'T take 15 minutes to process a return when there isn't even anyone in line. \n\nPS - I resent the fact that everyone who goes to the coffee shop here decides to move in. Don't you people have internet at home?! The coffee isn't even top tier. Why are you sitting here like shmucks? I just wanted a place to study when the library was closed, and naturally, there was nowhere to sit. Sucky.
1 ||| A year or two ago, Arizona Center was a destination for shoppers in need of Kokopeli socks or shot glasses blazoned with cacti. No more, no more! The kitschy tourist shops are gone, except for the flag store and the sports logo store. Most of the retail store fronts are simply empty.\n\nRestaurants are still around and range from pizza-by-the-slice through mediocre Mexican to kitschy family dining to high-end sit-down dining. If you're a conventioneer at a downtown hotel and want a walk and some palm-tree-infused atmosphere, you've got lots of dinner choices.\n\nThe major reason to come here, at this point, is that you live/work in or near downtown and want either (a) to see a movie or (b) to sit by a fountain and eat. Both of those functions are quite adequate and mean you took light rail or walked. DO NOT use the parking ramp. The few times I've tried it, I've ended up in a line of exiting cars with unreadable tickets. The parking system doesn't work, and it dumps you into some odd bit of \"turn this way only\" lanes at the edge of downtown.\n\nIf it's tourist kitsch you need for pals back home, you're now stuck trekking to Old Town Scottsdale.
1 ||| Okay.....I've only been here twice, so it's hard to judge.  But there were two things I disliked.\n\n1. Hardly any outlets!\n2. My chai latte, which was neither hot nor very tasty.  wah waaaaaah.\n\nIt's like, a block from my house, so I'm sure I'll give them another go.  There was a super friendly barista dude there last time, and the outdoor patio looks nice in summer.  But I'll need to have a tasty beverage of some sort in order to up this review.  sad face because I love local businesses!  But....I also love tasty chai lattes.  and I did not get one.
4 ||| Best Breakfast place in town. Very friendly and excellent service. Check out their wall of Fame ( Autographed photos of Local Celebrities & Politicians ) Love the outside seating, local news magazine selection, Coffee and Hash Browns.......
1 ||| I'm new to the area and wanted to try the local middle eastern cuisine, as back home I am blessed with a nice variety of it in the southwest suburbs.\n\nI went into the (just about empty) Jerusalem Restaurant and looked over the menu before being silently greeted by the notorious owner. I stepped up to order and he turned his back, apparently cooking someone else's food. I patiently waited and eventually ordered the daily special of kufta, salad and hummus. \n\nAfter observing my meal being cooked and assembled, I dashed home to try it.\n\nI opened up everything and was initially let down by the quantity I received for about $9. \n\nI started with the salad which looked to be a combination of many different vegetables including onions, celery, carrots, spices and a couple of other unrecognizable things. Even though there was a large array of different ingredients for this salad, it was unbelievably bland and some of the vegetables pretty hard in consistency. I couldn't figure out why, there was some kind of a dressing on it, but it wasn't much more than some type of oil, maybe a really light olive? I'm not sure. It then occurred to me that this salad was probably sitting for a very long time before I had eaten it. I wouldn't get it again.\n\nNext, my order came with Kufta (lamb & beef), 2 pitas and a very small dollop of hummus. The Kufta had a pretty unique flavor to it that I did like, but the quality of the meat was fair, at best. The pitas were decent but by far the best part of my dinner was the hummus. The hummus had a very nice taste and was complemented well by a splash of olive oil. It was not bland and definitely the highlight of my meal.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed having spent almost $. The portion size wasn't much, and the starch (pita) is really what filled me up.\n\nI will be back in sometime just to try something else and see if my review is consistent for all the food, rather than just what I had. This place has a variety of options and maybe I just picked the wrong one.
1 ||| I was excited to try this place and was extremely disappointed... \n\nMy boyfriend and I went here on a quiet Monday night and sat at the bar. Off the bat the bartender, a girl with dark hair and glasses, was just not nice at all. No smiles, just attitude. \n\nThe beer was meh, nothing I was impressed with, and the food was just not good at all. I ordered a burger with onion rings. Burger was blah, onion rings were soggy. I also got a side of mac 'n cheese, well, because I'm a complete sucker for mac 'n cheese. This stuff looked and tasted like it'd been sitting in a tub under a heat lamp all day. 2 bites and I was done. My bf also got a burger with the Parmesan fries... The fries were soggy, and it looked like they just shook a bunch of grated Parmesan out of the can on to them instead of using fresh parm. Not good at all. \n\n\nTypically I can forgive a place for having bad food if the service and drinks are good, but I'm sorry to say that this place was just all around bad.
3 ||| Not exactly close to ASU, but definitely has a college vibe to it. You can pick up brochures to join the local chapter of Amnesty International, New Times, and see an age range from parents with kids, to groups of older men meeting for coffee and breakfast, to college kids with their books.\n\nI also appreciate establishments that don't play canned Clear Channel or satellite radio and allow the staff to choose the music. When I was there Sunday they were playing \"The Queen Is Dead\" from The Smiths. You certainly wouldn't hear that at Einstein's.\n\nMy favorite breakfast bagel sandwich is the \"August 22, 1988\" for $4.99 (Chili Tapin Sauce, Egg, Sausage, & Pepper Jack Cheese). It's named after the day the Phoenix Cardinals made their debut. (I had assumed that was the hottest recorded day in Phoenix, but was incorrect).  The Chili sauce definitely gives it a swift kick to your tongue. A great breakfast bagel sandwich for that enjoy it on the spicy side.\n\nThey have your basic fare as well, and lunch sandwiches and salads.\n\nI want to also agree with Alexandra K. and cheer for the salt bagel. It seems to be disappearing from most bagel shops so I'm thankful they have kept theirs.
0 ||| CHEATS, LIARS and worst customer service ever. Furniture prices are decent but the customer service at this store is worst I have seen in my life. The sales associate didn't tell us the correct return policy and we bought furniture over $5000 which was delivered in broken condition and they took forever to fix/replace it. They need to start telling truth to people and be more respectful to customers. Manager Bob to sales person Oscar all our worst. Even the front desk lady is soooo RUDE.
1 ||| Like others have mentioned, it is a little more than difficult to find employees to help you. I stopped by this location closest to me to pick up a microwave. Some of the models we wanted to see were not on display, so that was a bummer. There was no one around to ask any questions, it was like a graveyard. However, since we had done our research online, we pretty much knew what they looked like and just selected the one that we wanted based on YouTube videos. We used our reward points to get $15 off. I recommend the Chandler location more, which has its own hits and misses, but at least I've experienced more \"hits\" there.
3 ||| I came here with my fiance's family for dinner and a little casual celebration.  The food was fantastic and the service was good.  The only down side is that the place is a bit noisy, and a little crowded.  People kept bumping into my chair as they passed, and while it's not overly loud, forget about holding a quiet private conversation.\n\nI had one of their specials that day, a shrimp ravioli, which was exceptional, with nice sized pieces of shrimp cut up into the sauce.  The chef seems to really know what he's doing.
1 ||| After being stood up by my studio photographer for the LAST time (a very angry yelp review is brewing in my head as I type this) I was getting dehydrated and gouchy as I haven't had a bite to eat all day. \n\nWe decided to go to La Olmeca for lunch. This place used to be one my auntie's favorites, so I chose to give it a go... We entered a booth filled resturant that seemed frozen in the 80s or worse - the early 90s. Wood paneled walls, grimy pastel booths and chipped wooden tables can be looked over when the food is good... but the food just wasn't.\n\nI had had the taco salad and was very disappointed. It was just meh. Taco Bell does a better jobat this lunch time favorite than these guys do. My mom got the cheese omlet special. She wasn't complaining, but I would be if I saw the brown underbelly of her overcooked omlet. Her potatos were straight from a bag. BUT the salsa was good. \n\nOverall... skip this place. Even if you're in the area... a couple blocks south and you'll be at Poncho's... trust me you'll be waaay better off! I don't think I'll ever go back.
0 ||| One of the worst customer services I have experienced in awhile. The waitress didn't seem to care immediately after we got our food. Waters were empty and she even asked if I want another beer, I said yes and she said \"of course you do\". Guess what? I never got my beer and the only time after that she was interested in clearing off our table. Again still had empty waters and didn't ask if we needed anything else. \nAlthough, I do have to say they had this song bingo game which was fun only to be ruined by the poor service. \nLastly the check. There was a comment card great i thought heres my chance to share feedback oh i couldn't because it was pre filled for us with \"excellent\" scores all the way down I have pics to prove it. Well I won't be visiting anytime soon. Thank you to the waitress Marci!
1 ||| This place used to be excellent and was packed years ago. The quality went down and the prices are way up. No value at all. They need to get this place back to where it used to be.
0 ||| I've been to this location a few times but last night was the WORST service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We got here a little before reverse happy hour so we waited to order food and drinks until 9pm. Our waitress barely came to our table to check on us and the place was pretty dead. We ordered our food at 9:10, got our pot stickers appetizer at 9:45pm. I ordered a sangria and it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Our friends couldn't get a refill on water and iced tea to save their life...the list goes on and on here. All of our entrees were cold and tasted like they had been re-heated and sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Really not appetizing and we all left hungry. When we asked to speak to the manager, she offered us a \"free\" dessert and after 30 minutes of waiting, we walked over to the hostess stand and waited to speak to her again. At this point, we didn't even want the dessert or anything to do with the place. Oh, and on top of everything, the place was FREEZING!! Yes that sounds great in the summer but it was unbearably cold. Overall, this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service. We were comped the food and offered a couple coupons but I am certain I will never come back here!!
1 ||| Wasnt that great of a place and I was really hoping it would be. The food was rather bland in flavor and was quiet frankly over priced for what it was. Haven't gone back since my first visit to give it another chance yet
3 ||| We've been bringing our Shih Tzu here for several years. They do a great job and our dog even looks forward to going here. They take time time to listen to what you want, and they treat the dogs with love. They don't take credit cards, though, so be sure to take a check or cash when you pick up your dog,
2 ||| What can I say... I've been here enough times that I greet Cliff and Norm by name whenever I stop in anymore. Doc and Eddy's is what a neighborhood bar should be, complete with lots of parlor games: pool, darts, ping pong, shuffleboard, air hockey, basketball, golden tee, and I think there may even be a foosball table. And it's a good thing they keep the lights low, not only for all the TVs, but I'm sure the place has needed a renovation for at least the last ten years.\n\nThe one thing I could certainly do without is the evening bartender who won't let go of the fact that I'm a UA fan. Seriously, he gives me crap in a not quite joking enough manner for my comfort level. If I knew him better, it would be one thing, but I seriously made my friend pay with his AssU credit card last time, just so I wouldn't have to check my drinks for loogies. This is sad, given the fact that I've watched many UA games with fellow Wildcats in this bar, and I know the guy to be pretty decent when he doesn't recognize me as the UA fan he likes to harass.\n\nAlso, please note that the food has been less than good on the last couple of visits (stale bread, incorrect order, long wait, etc.). I recommend sticking with drinks here.
0 ||| Let's just sum it up quickly. Wait was terrible on a late Thursday night. Finally seated, 15 mins before they took our order. Food came out, cold and or overcooked. Only good thing was our waiter, he was doing his best. Will not be returning with all the late night choices down Central.
0 ||| I will never return to this dry cleaner. They destroyed 3 of my husband's shirts. One returned to us ripped in half. They did give us a credit so I let it go and gave them another chance. The final straw was today when I went to pick up a dress that was brought in for dry cleaning. The ruined my brand new dress because the they washed it instead of dry cleaning it. They said it was not there fault. I disagree.
2 ||| The greek's just don't make a good falafel, I should know this by now, alas I had to try it.\n\nAthenian express is a cute down town fast Greek eatery, you order at the counter and they bring it out. They have a array of food items salads pitas pastas sandwiches etc.\nI went for the falafel as usual. It was cheap enough ~$5 it came with a choice of side }(Salad, fries or potato salad). It comes as a round Peta cut in half with a few flat dry falafel patties and a plastic cup of tiziki. The side salad is nice but small if you are hungry go for the fries. Over all I was not impressed but I will try some other item here.\n\nBig plus for me was the huge hot sauce selection.
1 ||| I've come to this restaurant several times and I always hope that things will be just a bit better each time.  Each time I get the same experience.  Decent food.  Crappy service.  If I never set foot in this place again, I wouldn't miss it.  But it's one of those places that is close to the 101 and is in the neighborhood.  \nChips and salsa are probably the best thing they serve.  Today I got the lunch taco's plate and the beans were old, the rice was bland and the tacos were just standard. And I had already lowered my expectations on the service based on previous visits, and they didn't disappoint.  They were just as lame as usual. Give them a star for meeting my super low expectations!
0 ||| Ever taken a flight on a crusty dog turd? Neither have I, but I imagine it's not much unlike flying US Airways--the all time worst airline in every conceivable way.\n\nHow does an airline (that is already at the bottom of the barrel) get away with cutting back so ridiculously far on service while simultaneously  jacking up prices so ridiculously high on everything from water to luggage to aisle seats?!\n\nWow, great business plan, douchebags--take something that already sucks, make it worse and charge people more for it!  \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the greedy crack smokers that run this airline started charging for toilet paper. By the square.
2 ||| So being underage and not being able to do ANYTHING in Las Vegas this was my only option for entertainment. Welcome to the strip club review.\n\nI met some friends of mine (who are all 21+) who decided it would be fun to take me to a totally nude strip joint. was I excited? YES! \n\nwe arrived around 1:30am and I gotta say...Wow, this place looks super shady. These are the places where you know there's a heavy chance you'll get shot and mugged. We quickly lowered our ghetto rap music which was blasting and causing attention. (3 white boys and a Asian in Prius hybrid)  YEA real hood!\n\nWe immediately get in line looking perky as hell. A little drunken smirk is clearly visible on each person. We finally got in at 30 dollars a head (out of state price) which was in my opinion kinda ridicules. We arrived inside to see a typical movie interpretation of a strip joint. cigarette smoke air source, black lights galore, diverse hoo-da-fa clientele.\n\npros and cons!\n\npros-\n\nsome of these girls are absolutely gorgeous. My mouth hit the floor with some of them. like Maxim/penthouse gorgeous! I told one of them they should model and she told me \"No honey, I like stripping\" GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME! ;)\n\nSome of them could really dance. Like cirque du soleil style but without clothes on. This one girl literally climbed a 20 feet pool like a monkey! I was more amazed then turned on to be honest.\n\nI saw a guy \"Make it rain\" for the first time! He continuously threw 25-40 one dollar bills in the air and it made me so happy for the experience to see that.\n\nthere's hookah here! I made friends with a couple and they were willing to share theirs with me... kinda cool! ;)\n\ncons-\n\nthese girls are very very very forward. (AKA hustling)\n\nI was standing by myself watching the stage while one came from the front and back of me. I was stuck and a little afraid to be honest. It was like a scene from Jurassic park with the raptors! They both tempted me about the luscious things awaiting me in the VIP with both of them. I politely decline but they kept asking.\n\nThe club got repeative after an hour or so and I got little bored to be honest.\n\nPerhaps I don't understand the real appeal of strip clubs. The idea sounds amazingly fun, but once your there it's not. \n\nthe strippers paid more attention to the less attractive older crowd then the younger kids due to $$$ of course.\n\nall in all.....it was definitely an experience.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe, just not with any high high hopes.
1 ||| As a vegetarian, I was really excited to try this place out, but unfortunately had a really bad experience.\n\nCame in the other night around 8:30pm, wasn't busy at all, we were sat and waited almost 20 minutes before we were even greeted at the table, after we ordered we waited another 30 minutes for the food to come, our pad Thai was cold, and they forgot our other plate, and when it finally came it was burnt. And that still would've been okay but our server was unapologetic and didn't seem to care.\n\nI work as a server as well and know things can get busy and mistakes can happen and I am sympathetic with that. But the overall service was bad, slow, and the food was disappointing.
3 ||| I saw a Colour Academy and Public Radio concert at Visulite. It is a sweet spot with a tables and chairs option or a pit in front of the stage to stand or dance in. Wide selection of beers and other drinks for a decent price. My only complaint at Visulite was the smoke. I'm not a smoker myself and I hate leaving places smelling like stale cigarettes.
1 ||| Uh no. Sorry. I tried this place, upon Dana V's recommendation (and I'm subletting from her too!), but it just didn't do it for me. I've had pasties in England (not the OTHER kinds of pasties, you sicko), and they were well-seasoned, juicy, and comforting. Teddywedgers was not like those at all.\n\nThick, lard-y bland crust. Meat needs more flavoring--tasted too much like cheap ground beef to me. Some worcestershire sauce, garlic, I dunno, SOMETHING.
4 ||| If you are looking for a Barber Shop that is good with price and customer service, this is the place to go! \n\nWasn't really sure what to expect when I went to Vick's Barber Shop other than a much needed haircut but the overall experience was worth the new adventure. Inside are three chairs two of which were occupied by other customers so there was no wait (bonus). Roger was open and I was promptly seated. He did a great job on my tapered fade. I noticed that all the customers were lined up clean and straight. I will most def be back to this spot! Thanks again Roger.\n\n\n(Obviously this was from a man's POV)
3 ||| This has been a great bike shop for me as an avid mountain biker that needs to take my ride in for maintenance and parts 2x per year.  The owner Terry is as nice as they come and this bike shop always goes out to their way to over deliver on service and customer care.  With that said, I have never purchased a bike from this shop so I can't speak to that experience. One thing about this shop is that they are always busy so I like to take my bike in during slow times (not weekends).
4 ||| Stopped at Ulta after work to browse and look for a new face wash. As picky and sensitive as I am, I asked two associates for help-Susan and Florence-who each helped me for at least 30 minutes. Susan assisted me first (she was patient, informative and helpful), but after I went back to searching on my own I was still stuck. I was comparing reviews of products on my phone when Florence started assisting me. Unfortunately, Ulta doesn't give samples, but Florence said I could try out her favorite product in their salon sink to get a feel for it. She went above and beyond, and gave her own advice plus suggestions based on what she's seen work best for others. Totally didn't feel like she was just trying to sell me products, unlike when I go to Sephora. This location has a great staff and a huge selection.
3 ||| This pertains to the actual pharmacy, not the store as a whole. \n\nThe pharmacy staff are always kind, cordial professionals. I've been using this pharmacy for about 10 years and the pharmacists have stayed the same. While the staff of techs may change - possibly due to their being pharmacy school students - the turnover rate is low. My experience has always been that the staff are respectful and friendly, and I have observed them treat other people that way as well. The lead pharmacist seems to be a good role model for the people who work for him.
3 ||| I've eaten here twice.  First experience was lunch with the wife.  We had an intimate dining experience and really enjoyed our meal.  Seated at a small, cozy booth; the restaurant was uncrowded and we were unrushed.  We remember the bread as exceptional (I note at least one other reviewer found it lacking).  The food was very good.\n\nSecond visit was a weekend dinner and the place was packed.  Three of us this time and we got an awkward table straddling the threshold between the main dining hall and the winterized patio.  There was a large, loud group in the small patio type room behind us ruining the atmosphere.  The kitchen seemed stressed, our meal was delayed, and my memories of the experience are not good - but I do remember the food was fine.\n\nMy advice, go at an off hour - perhaps for an early dinner.
2 ||| I can't speak for other Yelpers but I have never had too much of a problem with the service. However, I do have to say it has been about six months since I have actually sat down to dine there. When we have in the past, the hostess was always very cordial. As for the servers, it usually averages out each time I had gone - ignored this time, really good service the next time. Most of the time I order the Hong Kong pan fried noodles, some bbq pork or if I am with my mom also some roast pork. Most of the time we also get sauteed Chinese broccoli (yes, I do broccoli if it is of the Chinese variety.) Everything is usually very delicious, very flavorful and not \"Americanized\" at all. \n\nLately, I find that I mostly go here during lunch time to order from their take away counter. It is always their bbq pork and rice. The old man behind the counter is pretty friendly and the young lady who rings up my order is pretty nice as well. For me it's a carnivores delight. So I guess if you don't want to risk the service at least try the counter where you can see them weight your food for the correct price :-)
2 ||| good way to get a cheap haircut.  good way to get a bad haircut from an inexperienced student.  you never know what you're gonna get!!  The prices are really good so if you want an Aveda salon on a super low budget it may be worth the risk.  ASU ID's also get an additional discount.
0 ||| I was in AZ for work and pulled in to a strip mall because I needed to check out a business in said strip mall. I spotted the coffee shop and thought about the perfect timing of it; I had just finished the cup o' joe from the hotel earlier that morning. So, I went in to the shop to find a gentleman in line. Rather than wait, I used the restroom. When I came out he was gone, so I walked up to the counter. I'm a super friendly person by nature, so I tried to hold up a conversation with the woman working about  how great it smelled in the shop...spreading cheer as I tend to do. I like to chat and be pleasant! She didn't seem too receptive.  I ordered a black coffee.  So she rang me up and said $2 was the total. I took out my corporate card to pay for it because after all, I was working and  my company covers my food and drinks while I'm on the road. She said they don't take plastic for less than $5 totals. She asked if I'd like a muffin or something else...to reach $5. But, I didn't want a muffin. I just wanted coffee. I love coffee...maybe too much because I can have many cups throughout the day.  So I said no. I also said \"I'll go somewhere else\". I think that may have made her angry. I actually really didn't mean it to be snippy and I didn't feel it came off that way.  And if I offended her with that comment, I'd gladly apologize.  That sincerely wasn't my intention. Truth be told though, I just wanted coffee and nothing else and I didn't want to pay for more than I wanted. I had no money on me at all...literally not a single dollar. I don't carry cash...just debit. I told her that. I apologized. As I was walking out she said under her breath \"are you gonna go to the bathroom somewhere else too?\" Under her breath but audible enough for me to hear it...which was clearly her intention. In retrospect, I'm really trying to see this from her perspective. I am a good, honest, caring and reasonable person.  I actually felt badly once she said that.  I try to have empathy for people. So I turned to her and said \"ma'am, I had every intention of buying a beverage but you don't take debit cards\". I was STILL trying to be kind. Then she said \"well shame on you for leaving the house without money\". I think I was just dumbstruck at that moment.  Really?  SHAME on me?  That's excessive!!  I had no idea what to say. Are you serious? Still being civil I explained to her that I am on the road for work and that my company pays for my food and beverage but I have to use their credit card for that to happen. At this point she said \"you can leave now\". And I said, \"I would think as a business owner you would recognize that people don't always carry cash on them\". She gave me the ole' \"shoo fly\" hand motion to which I said. \"I'll be sure that I tell everyone I know to stay away from this place because of your poor attitude\". I was shaking as I walked out!!  I was hurt and offended and so angry all at the same time.  The worst part is, I realized later, that I think she saw me as some cheap little punk who had no intention of buying a beverage. But darnit, I really wanted a coffee! When I do fieldwork for my job, I am casual...wear jeans and boots. I happened to be in all black that day. So, I think she just prejudged me and stereotyped me. I guess maybe I should have earned her respect by telling her I was there on business for the Fortune 100 (actually Fortune 50) company that employs me. Maybe I would have been treated differently.  As an out-of-towner, one bad experience somewhere can make some people question that entire area.  I'm wise enough to know that not everyone from AZ...or Scottsdale...is that rude.  But unfortunately, this woman doesn't help someone feel welcome there.  I have many friends and co-workers in the area even though I am not there often.  I told them all about my bad experience.  I have their support!!
2 ||| Obviously this isn't the most authentic Mexican place you could go to eat at, but it definitely is good. I had the Achiote Grilled Chicken Salad which was super yummy. The salsas are okay--the red one is my favorite. My friend had the tostadas and she said they were good. I would come here again for a quick lunch.
3 ||| Cool place. Love getting gas here instead of Henderson.
1 ||| My red dress came back pink. Many of my items had spots that kind of looked like oil maybe. It is sad when your clothes are returned looking dirtier than they did when you dropped them off. Based on the other reviews maybe they were having an off day. I sure as H won't be back to find out
0 ||| They advertise sale prices but you have to pay $25 membership to get the price! Went in to buy a portable camp fire, retailing at 134.99, they jacked it up to $138 with savings, and $185 without the membership. Even called before hand and they said they had two in stock and they were $130. What a joke! They also charged more than retail on the other items I was there to buy as well. Shame on you CAMPING WORLD!  I went to SPORTSMAN WAREHOUSE instead and found what we were looking for.
0 ||| Gotten sick multiple times from Volcano although I used to frequent it. There is a reason they are cheaper than other places. Cheap = bad. You'll probably get sick later... that is if you can even drink it with those hard as a rock boba they serve in it.
3 ||| Woe is me, what took me so long to discover this place? And to think, all the times that I've craved Indian food, Maharaja was just a short drive away...\n\nMy friend and I ordered the chicken tikka masala (mild), the fish curry (medium), and the regular naan. Our entrees came with a side of rice and a complementary flatbread appetizer served with tamarind sauce and two types of chutney (onion and cilantro). While the portions are small, the food is very filling - probably on account of all the carbs! :P\n\nAs for our dishes, the chicken was a little tough, but otherwise well-seasoned. I really enjoyed the creamy tomato base, and I was glad that I ordered it mild instead of medium because the medium fish curry was REALLY spicy. I was a huge fan of the battered catfish cooked in a garlic/ginger sauce, but I could only take so much heat. :( \n\nService was impeccable. Our water glasses were always filled quickly and plates were cleared off the table as soon as we were done with them. The staff continually circulated by to see how we were enjoying the meal and seemed genuinely interested in any feedback we had about our dining experience.\n\nJust an FYI, the online menu is a little outdated. I wanted to order the chana masala but it wasn't an option on the restaurant menu. Fortunately, you really can't go wrong with any of the curries or masalas! Give 'em a try! :)
2 ||| If there is a bar that totally identifies with and even cherishes the fact it is a full blown college hang out, it is Hemingway's located at 3911 Forbes Avenue in Oakland. Its central location on the Pitt Campus draws a very young crowd looking to have a good time without traveling too far.\n\nThough Hemingway's has some great specials (daily $1.75 beers, all day long) and a stellar beer selection, the set-up of this bar reduces its appeal. It is narrow to begin with and coupled with an awkward raised seating area spanning the middle complicates patron mobility. On a busy night it often takes five minutes to walk from the front to the back of the bar. Hemingway's has a pool table and dart board located in the back, but they are squeezed into a room entirely too small often making a game of billiards an unpleasant experience.\n\nOne aspect Hemingway's really has going for it is its staff. The same bartenders have been working here for as long as I can remember and they are good at what they do. Fast and efficient, even when the bar is at full capacity, they never short you on liquor in your mix drinks. Hemingway's also employs a number of wait staff to take food and drink orders and are a convenient option on packed nights.\n\nThe food here is not bad, and come between 9 and 11 and entrees are half off. Options from wraps, to burgers, to pasta dishes highlight the menu.  Don't expect anything great.  Just the normal cheap bar food.\n\nThe decor at Hemingway's is unique. Thousands of framed pictures of drunk college bar-goers cover every wall; a fitting choice for a college bar. It never gets old laughing at all the drunkards pictured here.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this bar is most suited for the newly turned 21 crowd. When you get a littler older, especially after graduation from college, the patronage here seems a bit juvenile. That being said, if you're looking for a cheap night out and some decent bar food for a great price then stop by Hemingway's.
3 ||| I look forward to eating at Bandung every time I am in Madison. Usually once per year.\nThe Vegetable Curry with bamboo chutes is so fricken good, you'll lose your mind! The bamboo is so tender, you'll think they're noodles! From the sound of the other reviewers, I seem to get lucky with the service. They've been friendly enough to me. Or perhaps I go at the right time, because I don't seem to to recall it ever being too terribly busy. The prices seemed fair and decent to me too. I don't blame folks for docking stars for bad or nasty service, but for those reviewers who don't seem to care for tasty international flavors nor the price of a $7.95 lunch or a $9.95 dinner...may I suggest Swanson\u00ae Frozen Foods.
3 ||| I dig Sky Harbor Airport! The parking isn't bad and the facility is easy to navigate. They have great cab and shuttle services too. The restaurants they have in the terminals are mostly popular chain restaurants and the pricing is about the same.
3 ||| Best Wok has been serving great Chinese food here for many, many years. I've worked down the street about 500 yards for 30 years, so I've eaten here a lot. I probably grab lunch here at least two or three times a month. It's very consistent.\n\nThe staff is family, and most of the same folks seem to have been there consistently since it opened.\n\nThis is a quick place for a lunch, or for take-out. I nearly always order mixed vegetables with chicken added, but I'll occasionally surprise the lady at the register and have their special of the day, or Cashew Chicken, or Moo Goo Gai Pan, or a steamed veggie entree. (They know my face as a bartender would, and usually start rattling off my order before I do!)\n\nThey have great egg rolls and crispy chicken wings, and they will cook your food the way you like it. No MSG? Check. Less oil? Check. Hotter or milder spices? Check. Just ask. \n\nAtmosphere is early cheap lunch booth, and seating space is limited, which is probably why they do such a great take-out business. I just go there for the food, which I crave as a guilty pleasure.
3 ||| Come hungry, leave full. This Henderson deli is one of the best spots to grab a bowl of soup or a sandwich, and the portions are massive.\n\nI have eaten here on many different occasions and have enjoyed my meal each and every time. The cabbage soup is some of the best I have ever tasted, and the bagel chips that accompany it are delicious. The sandwiches are huge, piled high and sure to fill up even the hungriest of appetites.\n\nThis small restaurant fills up quickly, so get here early if you don't want to wait around for a table. But don't worry, even if you have to wait the food is worth it.
2 ||| Heard from a source I trusted that this was the best Indian food in Charlotte so we checked it out. I'd still recommend Woodlands as my top choice. I went with the standard chana masala with medium spice. Sadly, it didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. I know it's a pretty simple order, but it tasted really plain. The wife ordered the vegetable jalfrezi and it was a better choice, plus it had veggies whereas the chana masala is just chickpeas. The carnivores seemed to enjoy their meals, so all in all it was a good meal. Just not my favorite.\n\nFun little game....I challenge you to try to get your water glass more than half empty before they refill it. It's not going to happen.
0 ||| Probably the worst service ever, i asked for help and have been waiting for 40 mins and still no one could help me. I meant really? 40 mins is not a short time...
3 ||| i always enjoy the concerts on Sunday evenings!  Great concessions and clean park to enjoy friends, family and music.  This is a great park to host any occasion for any age group.
1 ||| I was playing in a hockey tournament that gave your team preferred times and rink choice if you stayed at the hotel, plus it was the cheapest of the three tournament hotels. I should have known something was up, when one of the major cross streets was Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. (if you do not know what I mean, go watch videos of Chris Rock). Saying the area was not the best is an understatement. The hotel and clientele reflect this. I respect the fact that it is a \"Locals\" hotel and Casino, but so is the Orleans and Terrible's off the strip. The hotel check in is fairly hidden in a small alcove, and the casino is fairly smoky. \n\nTHE ROOM- well what can I say, 2 beds, a shower and a tub, and a basic TV. They say they have wireless, but in a 3 night stay, the first 2 nights they had to come and reset the access point. The last time they did this, they said the access point in our room was broken, so we did not have WiFi, but they were \"nice\" enough to loan us an ethernet cable. The speed is terrible, and do not even try to stream a video with their network. \n\nCasino- Fair at best. Few blackjack tables, and if you think other sports are better than basketball, stay away. When I was placing some bets on hockey games, people in line were yelling to hurry up, even though there were no other open windows. (I was up there for less than 2 minutes)\n\nFOOD- when one of the fancy sit down restaurants is a DENNYS, you know you are in trouble. \n\nI value my safety and life, so I will be staying away from this place like the plague.
1 ||| I don't get it. When people here that I am from Chicago they ALL recommend Oregano's.  My husband works near the Shea location and brought a pizza home. The crust was super thin which I like, but it lacked pizzazz. I like deep dish, pan, thin crust, super thin, etc, but I did not like Oregano's. Also, they are more on the expensive side.
0 ||| If you like dated restaurants, with carpet that hasn't been clean in a decade, with an air quality that is stuffy and smelly, with long waits because they don't have enough waiters on the floor, and recipes that use the same 4 ingredients in all their dishes (one of them being LOTS of salt), then Riazzi's is the restaurant for you.
2 ||| This location offers horrible parking and is always busy.\n\nBut, they have an oven, meaning they are able to serve their breakfast sandwiches.\n\nThe Baristas are also all very friendly and do a good job of cleaning up (quickly) after people who are too lazy to throw their empty cups, napkins, ect in the trash.
1 ||| Appetizer came the same time as our entree (after an hour) ,  all the food was cold,  and the buss boy spilled my food on me. The place is also so family friendly everywhere I looked there was a crying child. Two stars cause the food would have been good if it was hot.
2 ||| I had to chuckle upon seeing Faith D's review, because I grew up with a W-S minutes from my home in south Florida and loved going to look at all the fancy gadgets as a kid - but why do I go to W-S now? To buy Star Wars, Disney, and Marvel comics cupcake liners and cookie cutters. \n\nNot that W-S doesn't have plenty of adult kitchen things to splurge on.. knives, one-task utensils you don't really need, beautiful stem and plateware, cookbooks galore, spices, salts, and bbq rubs, and some really awesome appliances that make me want to chuck my old cuisinarts out for, but sometimes do you feel like you're a fool for paying that much? Yes. Do I still really want the super speedy freeze pop maker? Yes. \n\nService here is a little sub par, I was probably one of three customers in the store and it took an employee about five minutes to say anything to me. I would suggest doing research online before entering the store, as they seemed to know a lot about some products, but then neither employee was quick to respond to questions about the Thomas Keller product line they carry.  \n\nI'll return for the specialty items, but if I'm in need of something I know Sur La Table also carries (or amazon.com), this won't be my first stop.
4 ||| Wow, this place amazed me.  I called first to be sure they had my battery in stock and was told to stop in to get it replaced, no appointment needed.  They just care about getting the work done and done right.  Changed my battery in 15 minutes and I was back at work in 25.  I am so glad I know where I can take my car and not waste my time or my money.  Thanks, Eric!
2 ||| Despite being seated in the back far from everyone else with my Asian boyfriend, I find myself coming back here again and again.  The service is not very good, especially what I perceive to be racism against white people.  However, the food is as authentic as it gets for Chinese cuisine in the Phoenix metro area.  Having recently returned from a stint in China, I can say this with a basis for comparison.  One distinct advantage to the already huge menu is that the cooks will even prepare food choices that are not listed on the menu.  Service is slow, food is good; don't expect any fortune cookies.  Ah!  One last thing: If you like \"hot pots,\" be warned: The hot pot dish on the menu is already prepared and simply served to you in a literal hot pot.
1 ||| The ONLY thing that deserves the second star is the view.\n\nThe food is crappy. That's it. Cheap food prepared poorly. I think I've experienced better flavor at Taco Bell.\nThe cheese plate? What a joke, 4 crackers with some room temp Walmart cheese.\nDrinks? Overpriced and over-poured.\nAmbiance? It's just weird...I felt like I was in a dungeon. \n\nIt's safe to say that I will never be returning.
2 ||| Harris Grill is 100% OK. The service is nice, the drink list is nice, the menu (albeit confusing) is nice, and my overall experience has been...err...nice.\n\nEverything is a little expensive, and I don't really understand the menu (are they joking in some places? Is it supposed to be serious? Why is everything priced awkwardly?), but they have a solid brew list and the outdoor seating is crucial.\n\nTake a date here, take a group here, or come on a Sunday morning for their brunch (which is also nice).
3 ||| I went here last night for my birthday dinner, and I was extremely happy with the entire experience. The biggest plus for me, aside from the food that is, was the waitstaff. All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.\n\nSpeaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited \"wine by the glass\" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!\n\nBread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.\n\nIn all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however). I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a try!
1 ||| Apparently, when I say I hate Red Robin, people react as though I'm saying I hate Disneyland. \n\nI just can't get into the jar of mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and tasteless meat they put into their burgers.\n\nGourmet burgers my ass.\n\nFries were great, spinach and artichoke dip was great. \nI guess I'll eat vegetarian here.
3 ||| There's different kinds of Mexican places around.  \n\nType A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.)\n\nType B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-berto's, Baja Fresh, Rubio's etc.)\n\nType C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas' Mexican Food, etc.)\n\nType D: \"Mexican Denny's\" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevy's, El Torito, Macayo's, etc.) \n\nType E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I don't know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.)\n\nValle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevy's or Macayo's.  It's visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  It's the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly.\n\nDo you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker.\n\nValle Luna means good Mexifood.  If you're in the mood for a Type D, bypass the \"Fresh Mex\" and come here.
0 ||| I think the $8 buffet is cheap.  A great price for sure.  On the subject of the food, I couldn't disagree more.  \n\nThe crust is thin, without the benefit of being crispy.  The sauce is bland and tastes like it came from #10 can.  The cheese is melted is probably the best thing I can say about the pizza at LJ's.  My favorite item was the fountain beverage.\n\nIf you like to be adventurous, try LJ's you might enjoy the sauerkraut pizza.\n\nAs for me, if I really needed to eat out on the cheap, I would rather go to Eatsa Pizza for lunch . . . the buffet costs less and the food is, marginally, better.
3 ||| Way better than your average \"bar\" food. But make no mistake, this place is a great bar. Lots of fun beers on tap, good cocktails, cool atmosphere. You can sit at any of a few high top tables, at the bar, or back in the back of the bar at a few booths. \n\nI've tried a few different appetizers in the few years I've been coming here. Standouts to me were the fried zucchini and the fried cheese wedges. These are somehow are leaps and bounds more delicious than any other fried goodies I've ordered at a bar. I've ordered a few different veggie options of entrees, of which they have a few tasty choices. The veggie burger is amazing, the veggie pita is nice crunchy mix of grilled veggies and asiago (mmm), and my new obsession is the Lot 17 salad, which I had never tried until recently. Wowwwwww. Huge portion, fresh berries, feta, fried leeks (!!!!), and a very fresh raspberry vinaigrette. \n\nDo yourself a favor, order anything. It's ALL good. But don't skip the fries. The regular fries are good. But I have no idea why you'd get those when you could get the cajun fries. They taste like the Andy Capp Hot Fries that you used to be able to get by the bag (I have no idea if you still can, don't really care, these are better). Spicy and crispy and a nice accent to whatever you choose. Not your thing? Then the sweet potato fries should be perfect for you. So. Freaking. Good. And the brown sugar/butter sauce they are served with is like crack. I've tried to duplicate it at home with little success. Worth the trip alone. I'm salivating right now. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful, service is usually great. A few TVs line this place so it's a good place to watch a game. I'd watch anything there if it was served with a side of that sweet potato fry sauce.
4 ||| Wild Thaiger celebrated its 10th year anniversary this weekend!  This is a neighborhood restaurarnt with first class food.  The chef and owner consistently refreshes the menu to great delight!  You will not be disappointed.
0 ||| I always see coupons for this place and today I found it and gave it a try. My first impression walking in was \"eh\" could be better, could be worse. The service, however- Couldn't get any worse. I've had days when I wanted to be anywhere but work, but this chick behind the counter was so angry/annoyed to be there it was coming off her in waves!\n\n I ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was BLECH!!! Nothing good about that thing. I also ordered a mini steak quesadilla. She made me a full sized instead. This turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful. The quesadilla was pretty darn good! Needless to say I wont come near this place ever again.
1 ||| Theres nothing special about this place, just so-so chinese food you can grab on the fly. Its not terrible, but i wouldnt choose to come here if i had another choice.
4 ||| I had the typical desert climate problem the day I went to the Auto Zone on Camelback and 3rd Street in Phoenix: sluggish battery. While the car would still start, I decided to get the battery replaced rather than call AAA. I'm not saying anything bad about AAA because when you're stranded it's tip-top. But when your car will still start and you're confident the battery is going, I recommend driving straight to Auto Zone. It's much less expensive than AAA and you'll wait less. When I got to Auto Zone I was the fourth person that day (and it was only 10 AM) to need battery replacement. I have a 2003 VW Passat which means you've got to peel off a cowl (I learned this is the proper term by reading the directions), remove a plastic piece that covers the battery and then figure out how to wedge the big European-sized battery out. The store manager, Chris, was very helpful. He did not act at all impatient that it took longer to change out my battery, even though customers were beginning to stack up by the time we finished. The whole process, including replacing the cabin air filter, took less than half an hour.
2 ||| Another lunch spot for the northshore.  This probably has the best food.  The french dip and the wraps are very good.  It's a tad pricey but not horrible.  They're really good for pickup.  As is a constant problem on the northshore, service is INCREDIBLY slow.  You won't get out of here in under an hour if you dine in.  The waitresses are just MIA with refills and bringing checks, and the food takes a while to come out too.  But if you have time to spend, it's probably the best lunch spot on the north shore.  If you're running low on time - call ahead and grab it to go.
1 ||| I was not real happy at this airport, there was no where to charge up my phone near my gate.  I hate to sit on the floor near the old phones on the wall and watch a bunch of people walk by.  I can't believe that an airport this busy hasn't upgraded their airport to help out those of us that are traveling and need to charge up phone and such.\n\nI have to stop here on my way back to Providence from ATL and really bummer by this.
4 ||| I flew into Pittsburgh on a Monday, immediately fell in love with it, and decided to ride up the side of a mountain to get a good look at the city and its brown rivers.\n\nThe funicular going up the side of the mountain was amusing, mainly in part because my companion is terrified of heights and spent the ride staring at the cable, convinced this would be our final destination. Once you reach the top, you step into a building that smells of rotten wood, mold and termites. I happen to love the smell of old, scary places, so it intrigued me. Outside is a terrace where you get a beautiful view of Pittsburgh. Seriously, this view goes on for miles. We stayed for a while taking crappy pictures with our crappy iPhone cameras before the wind forced us down.\n\nIt was on the way down that we met a chatty local who told us many people in the city use this thing to get from the street above to the street far below. This isn't just amusement, folks, but public transportation. Hearing that eased my height-fearing friend who had previously likened it to an unsafe carnival ride.\n\nA cool way to blow 30 minutes for only $5 a piece. Bring cash only or face the wrath of the ancient ATM.
3 ||| The Comerica Theater, located in downtown Phoenix, accommodates 5,000 guests and on the night I came for an Arctic Monkeys concert, it was filled to capacity. My sister and I sat in the third section of seats behind the pit. Surprisingly, we were able to see and hear the band play clearly despite being somewhat farther! There were no big screens that night to show close ups of the band but that didn't take away from the experience at all. \n\nOne small complaint: My sister was refused service at one of the bar stations for having a vertical license card, despite the card clearly stating that she was years older than 21. I'm assuming the bartender didn't bother to look at the actual birth date because my sister was able to buy drinks at another bar station. Not sure if this is a Comerica Theater policy or just one employee's mistake.\n\nOverall, I really appreciated the venue's organization. My sister and I got into the place fairly quickly without any long waits. The show started on time and ran smoothly. I would definitely return the next time I'm in town!
3 ||| The week of May 14-20, 2012 is National Beer Week. Any of their brews are $2 off. A pint of their beer is less than $3 for this week. It does not matter what time because this special is a 24/7 promotion. I tried the 38 special which is a blend of two different beers. It was smooth and enjoyable. \n\nPair any of these cold drafts with one of their monster burgers and satisfaction is sure to ensue. I got the Tex-Mex; a thick burger topped with a grilled green pepper, cheese, bacon, crispy sweet onion straws, and a BBQ sauce. With a side of their sweet potato fries for an additional $1 hit the spot. Although the fries were cold, the burger more than made up for it. My friend ordered the Big Dog burger and something else came out. In the end, we split both burgers to help alleviate his disappointment. Instead, we were both very happy. Maybe just closing my eyes and pointing would not be a bad option.
3 ||| TOO BAD IT'S CLOSED!  Best Lemonade Around!  I weep for their fresh squeezed lemonade made with sugar cane syrup with sugar cane sticks to chew on.  (And they would bring you a 'side shaker' full of extra - like when you get a really good milkshake at a soda fountain!)  I used to love the Cuban sandwich, even though it made you feel like you needed a nap afterwards!  Why they got rid of this chain when there is such CRAP around here that should close down is beyond me...
2 ||| Nothing special, its the usual Denny's chain restaurant. Server were very pleasant and nice to everyone. Good for a quick breakfast with a nice coffee.
0 ||| I rented a car last month and I still have a hold on my account. When I called to talk to them they were very unprofessional and rude. While the car was nice and rates competitive I will never go back. All they had to do was be pleasant, you are in the service industry and customers are what keep you in business. I will not be returning.
3 ||| This place is good for the atmosphere. The food is okay. Nothing particularly stands out food wise except their honey toast.
4 ||| Our stay at this Best Western was great all around! We aren't particularly fancy people when it comes to staying in hotels, but this one made us feel that way.\nThe room we booked was the most basic and was very clean, spacious, and bigger than we thought (included a mini kitchen and two seating areas). We received a voucher for breakfast upon check-in. Thinking breakfast would be the same old rock-hard bagels and burnt waffle maker, we were pleasantly surprised to order, restaurant-style, meals like eggs and bacon and buttermilk pancakes, made to order. \nThe staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is located near major roads to get around the West side of Madison easily.
4 ||| Where to begin, where to begin...\n\nMore often than not, I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking about how I am going to blast an esablishment. I don't rave about \"good\" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\n\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \n\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \"What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \"Can I have another taco?\" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\n\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\n\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\n\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\n\nCome to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing. Do I really need to say any more?
0 ||| We've been to JP a couple of times before, but this time we had the worst service I've ever had - ever. We were seated right away, had to wait 10 minutes for menus, then another 15 minutes before the waitress took our beverage and food order. We had to ask for silver ware 3 times and my husband never got his coffee cup refilled. It took about 20 minutes for the food to arrive, not bad, but mine was burnt. Another 10 minutes waiting for the check, and after waiting 15 minutes for the credit card to  be picked up, we paid cash instead and left. We won't be back.
4 ||| The following things make Ri Ra amazing, no arguments. Period. End of discussion.\n\n1. McSorley's Dark, not only on draft but served in half pints as God intended.\n\n2. Colman's mustard available on request. She brought malt vinegar for my fries, sorry \"chips\", without me having to ask. Together they are the end all, be all of chip eating.\n\n3. Super tasty and generous food. I loved the beer battered fish and chips and the pork chop with broccolini and potato cake looked (and I'm told was) great.\n\n4. Cragganmore single malt. Yes, it is pricey. A single will run you $12 but it is my favorite scotch, so I say it gets a number.\n\n5. Friendly and jovial staff. We made an open table reservation on a Friday night and though they called to say they couldn't necessarily honor the exact time, when we showed up they had our table waiting despite walk in customers waiting to be seated.\n\n6. Did I say McSorely's and Colman's w/malt vinegar? Because if I did why are we still talking?\n\nRi Ra is a classy version of the Irish pub I love to feel at home in. Go check it out. It might just save your impression of Uptown.
1 ||| I like going out but this place makes it hard to really want to come back.  Nothing in particular about the music or service or drinks.  It's just a worn out place.  I will say that the people watching in here is insane.  \n\nI do like the decor on the first floor, seems like a cool hangout and if I ever went back I'd probably just stay down there to soak it all in.  Upstairs is the dance floor and additional bar.  The floor was so sticky I don't see how anyone was really dancing.  I seriously thought I might be able to scale small buildings after being in there on that floor.\n\nPS. They don't even really serve breakfast.  They should think about it, then I might come back :)
3 ||| I have to be honest. I know Trader Joe's has healthy foods, but unfortunately I never buy them. Strike that, I did buy bananas for $.19 this past weekend along with precut veggies, but overall I always end up with the same naughty, overindulgent treats every time. Judge away Judge-A-Rella.\n\nHere's the list:\n\nChocolate Croissants- In the freezer section. You leave them out over night and pop them in the oven in the morning and you have the easiest, fancy breakfast to compliment your coffee. This is my favorite item at TJ. \n\nS'mores Ice cream Sandwich- The best store bought ice cream sammie I've ever had. I wish I never knew about these babies.\n\nMargherita Pizza- Why oh why did they force me to sample this last night? It was really good. I need to go to Pizza Anonymous meetings... \n\nRoasted Plantain Chips- They are better for you then potato chips, but still not good for you. Of course, I like them. I have them with salsa or guacamole and don't feel as guilty about it. I prefer these now. \n\nSpeculoos Cookie Butter- Less fat and calories than peanut butter. Also less protein though. This hasn't stopped my affair with this stuff. It melts like a smooth ganache on a whole wheat English muffin in the morning and I get my sweet and carb fix for the day. I can go on living now that I found you. \n\n(Pirate Booty- You are so 1997. I am over you.)\n\nThere are several other tasty delights I have found at Trader Joe's that are not organic or good for me like their jams, jarred sauces, curry soups, wine, etc. For those of you that go to this store and actually buy fruits and veggies and meats you deserve a cookie. I on the other hand cannot escape Trader Joe's without the bad stuff.
3 ||| La Parilla Suiza has been a restaurant that we've gone to for a long time in our family. Though we don't go as frequently, I believe the service and food seems to have slipped a bit.\n\nThe first thing that your MUST order when going is the \"Queso Suizo\" which is absolutely mouth watering amazing. Definitely a favorite when we go, and has and will always be delicious. Luckily, you get complimentary chips and salsas (green one is my fav), so that'll keep you busy before your huge plate arrives. \n\nTheir combination plates are pretty good, not too much a fan of their charro beans, but their chicken enchiladas and arroz are very tasty. Their chicken is always grilled very yummy, their fajita plate is veeeery tasty. Make sure to ask for extra green salsa for your food, it's a must.
1 ||| 90 minutes for 3 people to get breakfast... It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and an hour for our food. The beers we tried were good and the food was solid but based on the service I definitely won't be back to this location. It was not super busy and there was plenty of staff and we couldn't see what the extreme delay was all about.
0 ||| Disgusting place, poor attitudes, parking the worse! I took my daughter for a trim, got stuck with Ana, a person who makes it well known she is miserable and her life sucks! My kid spent less then 5 minutes in the chair, she looked the same when I brought her in, my worse issue is I left a $3 tip to this person.\nStay away from this store, many other options, this place deserves to shut down for good.
4 ||| This place just takes the cake.....\nI work as a personal assistant to a Surgeon and bring his laundry and dry cleaning here. They know me by name, I never give directions as to how to clean his clothes, nor remind them of the phone number attached to the account--these chicks have it down! \nPrices are steep but the quality is exceptional! :)
3 ||| Decided to try Hiro Sushi because of the  reviews as it is very difficult to find a good sushi restaurant in the valley.  With my husband being half Japanese, lived in Japan & just having visited Tokyo last May for 2 weeks - it takes a lot to win over our palates.  \n\nFirst, this not your typical modern sushi restaurant which translates to social meeting place/lounge for people that want mega rolls with different condiments splattered all over them. They have some, but  if that is what you think sushi is - head to Sapporo or RA.\n\nSecond, nothing against non-Japanese sushi chefs as they can be quite talented - but something about having Japanese sushi chefs creating your food that brings some authenticity to the whole experience.\n\nThird, the fish was fresh and was served in good portions.  Its not about bigger is better - quality is what you pay for when it comes to sashimi or nigiri.\n\nLooked over the entree menu - typical mix of tempura, teriyaki & katsu dishes - nothing real special.\n\nWill definitely go back.
4 ||| After moving to Glendale for medical school last year, Greek Wraps has been one of the few restaurants I visit on an almost weekly basis. The gyros here are the best in town, and it's all HALAL which is an amazing plus for any fellow Muslim brothers or sisters. I went there today and ordered a steak kabob sandwich, venturing outside my usual 10 inch gyro wrap. I didn't realize the steak kabob had hummus on it and started having a slight allergic reaction (allergic to sesame, from what I tasted though and for what it's worth, it was a great sandwich with good cuts of steak). I told one of the servers and they immediately swapped out my sandwich with something else without hummus; they were apologetic and did it ASAP with no questions asked. \n\nGreat service, great food. I strongly suggest everyone checks this place out!
3 ||| Came for the spring restaurant week.  Great overall meal!\n\ncourse 1 was a salad with fried zuchinni\ncourse 2 was a bruschetta with roasted garlic, tapanade, and tomatos marinated in balsamic vinegar served with crostinis\ncourse 3 was a mushroom ravioli with black truffles\ncourse 4 was dessert of mood donughts (cinnamon sugar donuts) with a dark dutch chocolate sauce.\n\nVery tasty and the food came out at a good rate.  Just enough to be finishing off the prior course.  The loss of 1 star came from the fact that as we walked in there was no one to seat us and the way the restaurant is, we weren't fully sure if we were in the right place or if we had missed the reception desk and walked into the dining room.  Either way the waitress was very friendly and always seemed to be present right when we needed her.\n\nGreat experience and would most def return.
4 ||| Only THE best brownie EVER! And, when I feel too guilty eating them myself, I turn into a food pusher and buy them as gifts for other people because they are so yummy! These are the kind of brownies you dream about... like literally. Not: you dream of ever finding a brownie like this. You ACTUALLY may have dreams about eating one! It's totally worth the drive to Gilbert (or you can order online and have them shipped if it's that much trouble for you) AND they offer a delicious brownie sundae where you pick any one of their 16 brownie flavors... they heat it up and top it with two scoops of ice cream plus the sundae topping of your choice. The sundaes are around $4. The chocolate macaroon frenzy is my personal fave! Brownie's by themselves are around $2.50. Watch the hours though: Pretty much \"daytime\" hours and they're closed on Sunday.
1 ||| Daytime service rocks. Never open after midnight lately, at least put up a sign so Im not sitting in the drive thru  for an hour looking lame!
2 ||| This place is a good lunch option. Let me first start of by saying I have only been there for lunch a few times and never dinner. The buffet had some good choices but not so good variety. The taste however was more then there. The spice was just how I like it. The nann was very good and what you would expect. Price is reasonable and competitive. Service was good
4 ||| This is a great, laid back find in Mesa. I had the best sandwich of my life! The theme is controversial, but done well. In addition to sandwiches, they do have salads and even kool-aid. Definitely an unique place!
0 ||| First and last time going to this place. I got there at 12pm ordered a jerk chicken sandwich and a salad for my wife. At 12:40pm the manager comes and tells me its going to be a few minutes more. To which I replied \"What\" you mean to tell me it takes u 40 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich. And the place was not even full of people. Bad service do not recommend going there.
4 ||| Lunch with the Madre and her work folk and I can never say no to Thai food.\n\nWe arrived just before the lunch rush, thankfully because I was famished.  Vegitable spring rolls for an appetizer (delish!) and it was a close tie between garlic chicken or pad thai.. Pad thai won the decision by a nose.  \n\nI ordered a level 4 spice but I think the young Miss taking my order skipped that bit of information because my dish lacked spice completely.  This could have been a total taste-bud disaster but luckily the noodles were flavored to perfection, spice-less and all.\n\nAll in all the service was super and the eats were delish. If I'm ever on the north side again and in the mood for Thai, Pin Kaow will be on my list.
2 ||| This was bigger than I thought with an upstairs, but for a quick meal that was Italian, you cannot go wrong. The restaurant itself inside feels night and something similar to what you would see a Bucca and other family Italian joints. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the wedding soup.\n\nThis would be nothing I would bring home to my girlfriend's Italian home but it was good/okay. The prices were moderate and I would suggest the Wedding Soup if you were to want something small and quick.
2 ||| This is my favorite taco joint in Vegas...if you don't count the ladies selling contraband tamales out of stolen grocery carts. But they stay on the move, so you can't count on them. As a side review, the lady who used to sell them around Twain and Swenson was particularly good. \n\nBut, I digress. There are a few Tacos Mexicos scattered around, the ones I frequent are this one at Sahara and Valley View, the one across from the Huntridge Theatre, there's one on short west Trop, and the one down on the North End by the Stratosphere.  There is no consistency between them, one may stew the chicken for the tacos, another may grill it, but  it's all good...and every time I am in there, I am the only gringo in the place. \n\nThe hardest part is dealing with the juke while waiting...Somebody explain to me, when the hell did the polka get adopted as the national pop music form in Mexico?  \n\nThe menu board still has duct tape over where it said \"Sesos\"(brains) because of the whole mad cow thing I guess, but you can still get \"Tripas/Guts\" \"Buche/Beef Cheeks\" \"Cabeza/Head\"(not that kind, cross the county line, freak) and \"Lengua/Tongue\" tacos....but I don't like to taste anything that can taste me back, so I stick with chicken, carne asada, and al pastor, tacos, burritos, tostada, whatever I'm in the mood for. Oh yeah, and most importantly, it's 24 hours. \n\n It ain't super clean, if you are into that. But when I was a kid in NY my dad always used to say that the guy with the dirtiest fingernails had the best hot dogs, and that's kinda how I look at Tacos Mexico...yeah the floors are greasy, and in at least one of them the cook is missing a hand, but what the hell. Good burritos don't fall off of trees.
1 ||| Overpriced and nothing special really, I had Bagel, Lox and works, all I got is 2 see through tiny pieces of lox for $10! Bagel was good and fresh but for this price I might as well go to Einstein bagels for more lox and cream cheese
0 ||| Waited for 10 minutes to be told there was a sign up list in the corner about 20 feet away in the opposite direction. After another 30 minutes of waiting some lady walked up that was NOT on the list, said she was here about 30 mins (I'm at 40 mins now) and the guy started helping her for her sons prom. What is the point of the list again?
0 ||| My son made reservations for Mother' s day for our family and specifically requested handicapped accessible  seating.  Upon arrival we found we were seated  upstairs,  not on the main level by the handicapped entrance.  When I asked the location of the elevator I was told they don't have one...\"it called legs\".  (not a good response for an Iraq veteran in a wheelchair).  After being told to go back outside and up the main entrance to the upper level we found the seating involved steps.  When I pointed this out to the waitress, she suggested we just turn the wheelchair  backwards and take my son down the stairs.  When advised this was not acceptable. we were moved to an downstairs location.  This involved my son going back  down the upper ramp, outside and back in the handicapped entrance...then to the other end of the building.  This situation stressed my son so much he was unable to eat with us.  The staff at Rustlers  Roost is in dire need of sensitivity training.
1 ||| I get take-out from here occasionally, purely out of convenience and lack of competition.  During my last pick-up, the evening of 6-22-12, I witnessed a patron quietly complaining about the confusion and lack of separation between those waiting to pay, waiting for an order, and waiting to be seated.  The front waiting area was in mass confusion.  The response from the manager on duty was to insult the patron, saying \"grown men should be able to wait on pizza, and basically, I don't care\".  This is not an acceptable response for management.  \nThe quality of our pizza is mediocre at best, with the toppings being more than 2 inches from the edge on a hand tossed pizza.  The lady at the register was friendly as usual.\nThis Pizza Hut is not a top choice, but ok in a pinch.
4 ||| I've been here a few times over the past few years and I am never disappointed. Usually I call ahead of time to place and order and just swing by and pick it up. They are not so accurate with estimated times your food is ready though. You can order one item or the whole menu and they always say it will be ready in 10 minutes. \n\nMy favorites here are the chicken enchilladas and the quesadilla. I've never tried their burritios. The place is not too big and it can probably only seat about 12-16 people. So be  aware you may need to do carry out.
0 ||| Ok, I wasn't expecting a lot when my husband and I wanted something quick to eat and a little different and our usual Rubios, but I should have trekked a little further to Pei Wei. \n\nI was craving pad thai and I knew this place had it, so I order that with no meat. I then asked if I could have tofu instead. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted the tofu deep fried. I said no and my husband ordered two egg rolls. The total was $19! I knew that was off, so when I mentioned it, he said that the tofu was a brick of tofu. I told him I didn't need a whole block of tofu, just some to put in my pad thai. He then said he couldn't do that? What?? You can sell whole blocks of it, but you can't put it in my food? I said no to the tofu and waited for our food.\n\nAfter we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!
3 ||| I came here with my fiance and another couple.  We wanted to eat at Mr. Tofu, but they are closed on Sundays.  My fiance used to come to Tofu Hut a lot before discovering Mr. Tofu.  Since I have limited experience with Korean restaurants, I will be comparing Tofu Hut with Mr. Tofu, which is directly across the street.  The parking in both places could be better.  Tofu Hut has more seating and was busier.  Some tables at Tofu Hut had grills built into the tables.  As you may know, each meal comes with some complimentary sides.  The sides at Tofu Hut are better.  I like the fish cakes.  Also, they gave us slices of bread made from rice that was pretty good.  I always order the same thing, bibimbap dolcet.  They are equally good at both places.  Tofu Hut gives you a large bottle of spicy bean paste.  Mr. Tofu provides a small portion.  The rice never got crunchy, which is my favorite part.  I guess the hot pot cooled down too much before they could add the ingredients.  Perhaps an oversight because they were so busy.  A careless mistake in my opinion.  That is the best part of the dish.  At Tofu Hut, bibimbap dolcet also comes with spicy tofu soup made with spicy bean paste.  That was the best part.  Really good and hot.  They add one raw egg.  I love dipping the fish cake in the spicy soup.  I think the price is similar.  My fiance got her usual, which is tofu soup.  It was not very good.  Our friends ordered galbi, bulgogi, and some sort of spicy chicken dish.  The galbi was very good.  The bulgogi was disappointing.  The other chicken dish was really good.  Overall, I liked Tofu Hut better, but I doubt my fiance will agree, so you will probably see me back at Mr. Tofu.  Both are good.
2 ||| We go to Pewter Rose once every couple of months for brunch, mainly because I love their fruit/granola/yogurt dish, which is really difficult to find anywhere else. I was SO disappointed this morning to find out that their executive chef is new, and that dish is no longer on the menu! They also updated their benedict to a black forest benedict and added huevos rancheros. Thankfully, they kept the free butterscotch scones! The food is still great, but I was disappointed that my favorite dish is gone. A small OJ was $3, and a coffee was $3.25, which seems high (not sure if the prices are different now).
2 ||| This place is a friendly and tiny(but clean... high 90s) hole-in-the-wall where you can usually count on an authentic and fresh meal. I go here when I'm too lazy to go to lotus of siam, which is not overrated :-)  Like LOS, the prices here are so-so($2 too much for most items).\n\nI always order duck curry or green curry, and I've only been disappointed once. 3 stars because the shrimp soup here is so bad I almost fell on the floor laughing after I took a second taste to confirm its horribleness.
0 ||| I just boarded a US Airways flight and asked the attendants in the very front to help with my luggage because I have a fractured rib and both of them said no they can't.  They offered to check my bag in. So, I walked over to my seat and asked a 3rd attendant for help. He jokingly have me a hard time, but did it.  I was in no mood for jokes.  I've flown with Southwest for years consistently and I've never seen them turn away anyone who needs assistance.  I will never fly with US Airways again! Flight 510 leaving PHX to SMF at 1:36 pm.
4 ||| This is a great place to order how YOU want not what they have, change your sandwich to have Green Chili, no problem. Love this restaurant.
0 ||| This place SUCKS....Stay away!  The 7th St location is a scam shack.  I went in for \"just break pads\" & they found $1,500 worth of things to fix. As I left quickly w/ no work done I had a new scrape, scrape sound every tire rotation. I took my Tundra to a real mechanic & he said everything is fine for quite a few more miles.  But that funny new sound???  It was due to the \"Just Brakes\" boys taking a crow bar (or some other tool) to the inside of the wheel  & pinching a spot down  so it rubbed on the drum.  They must think I'm dumb enough to turn right around after a couple blocks & have them fix an emergency they just created.  Give ME a break!
3 ||| Great Calamari and Southwest Nachos...used to work next door and frequent for lunch.  Staff very friendly.\n\nwww.tenayacreekbrewery.com
3 ||| Still a solid place for Italian. Returned after 6 months and again was served a solid chicken parmesan sub at $7.,99. Just mnake sure you ask for the sandwich special which gets you a drink for that price as well. Finally tried a slice of the pizza, but the BBQ chicken specialty slice of the day was only average. The BBQ sauce was too sweet for a pizza and there were no red onions on this version of the BBQ chicken pizza. Those are standard usually. Will stick to pasta and subs here for now.
3 ||| This place capped the night after getting hammerred in Shadyside 95% of the time.  It was pretty much guaranteed the drunken antics that would go down here would make you crack up.  The food was mediocre at best, but the old Indian dude that owned it (Pagoda as we all affectionately referred to him as) was worth the price of admission.  I downgraded it from 5 stars to 4 because his son sucks.
4 ||| Wound up getting married here after all!  On 6/23/2010 we utilized all my same ideas - and it was fantastic.  Better groom, same perfected wedding!
4 ||| Consistent quality and friendly service combine with my favorite craft-brewed IPA to make this my favorite place to unwind.
1 ||| This zoo is pretty large. That's the only good thing I can really think to say about it. They have a lot of parrots, which I really enjoy. Sadly, most of their parrots looked sick. They showed signs that are usually associated with stress and a poor diet, but I'm not sure why. They all had fresh fruits and vegetables available and large enclosures with room to roam around. The otters were in an incredibly tiny cage. It might have been good for a bird or two, but there were two otters in it. I know they're working on a new enclosure, but they shouldn't have otters in the first place if there wasn't a place for them. I felt like $30 was an insane price, especially when it seemed that anything worth seeing was under construction. They also nickel and dime you on the attractions. For $30, I shouldn't have to shell out another dime. The overall layout just seems dirty and drab right now. Hopefully that's one of the things they're working on. I can't imagine why anyone would go here instead of the much nicer, much cheaper Phoenix Zoo.
2 ||| Let this be prefaced with the fact that I don't like gums.  In any way shape or form.  This doesn't mean I don't like working out, I just don't much care for gyms.  I was hoping this one would be better as it looks fancy-ish and has a nice pool with water slides but when I took a tour of it, the fancy-ish part manifested itself as a car dealership.  Really.  Go take a tour and I dare to to tell me it doesn't remind you of buying a car.  Also, when the guy took us around on a tour, he was saying something about their ventilation and how it sucks all the bad smells out so it doesn't smell like a gym.  Well, I think he may have just gotten used to the gym smell because it stunk.  I will stick to my non-gym workouts.
1 ||| Grew up w/El Charro, USE to be great, now it's just 'go there if someother place is closed'! Dark and family orientated but I want good food, and you don't get it here.
2 ||| Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed with the flavor of the meat here.  Side dishes were pretty good. If you want a good smoke ring and flavorful meat I prefer Rudy's. However, if you're in downtown phx and don't want to travel to the 'burbs this place will do
2 ||| On my first trip, I would've given them 4 stars...at least. But today...well, jeez, someone find out who is in charge of that salt shaker and remove their privileges. It tasted like an entire box of Morton's was dumped in my chicken...or maybe it was just the sauce that got salt cured. *sigh* Inedible. I was so sad. \n\nThe eggroll was fantastic though! \n\nI will give the place another chance just because my first visit was soooooooo good, but I won't be ordering the Qwik Chicken again. (I should've known better than to order something that didn't have any veggies in it anyway...shame on me)
0 ||| No, it's not a mistake. Polo Ralph Lauren gets 1 star.\n\nLooking around for more work clothes, I dropped in and experienced \"no\" customer service. It's not like I'm biased and think that Polo is overpriced, I just find it irritating when associates don't know what they're doing or what they're selling. \n\nThey may have been seasonal help but to \"not\" know what they have in their own store is ridiculous. Two different associates had no idea so I decided that I'd just have to give someone else my business. \n\nIf they were at least trying to be helpful I'd feel differently however, I wasn't important to them and I was interfering with their \"lives\" with the questions I had for them.
2 ||| Sky Harbor's aiight. I have no problems with it, but I'm not infatuated with it either. Driving through it is a pain, I'll leave it at that. The numerous curbs are confusing. Terminals are far apart, but that's not so bad. Security checkpoint C is annoying, and the TSA here are overly strict and lack IQ points, and assume everybody is a terrorist. Other than that, flights are usually timely, and there's plenty of places to eat and buy things. It's dark and gloomy, but it's never too crowded, even the day before Thanksgiving. Just your average airport, with free wifi!
0 ||| This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!
1 ||| This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\n\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\n\nBaristas are friendly and fast.
1 ||| Nice room, but this place needs to step up their breakfast. I feel that when I book a 3 star hotel I'm paying for a decent quality breakfast. That is not the case here; they had eggs, sausage, gravy, biscuits, waffles - really a good selection, but the quality was a step down from anything you would want to put in your body.
3 ||| Went here on a Thursday night around 9 PM.  One of the few places around here that's open past 9/9:30 PM.  Not too busy and service was prompt.  Salad with grilled Salmon was huge.  Enough salad for 4 people, Salmon was moist and good portion, though I would expect as much for $16.  Burger's flavor was good, frys were thick cut which is what I prefer.  Bun was decent and held burger.  Only issue was burger was over done, ordered medium rare, came out well done so very dry.  Manager took off few bucks without us even asking, I wasn't going too since I had already finished half of it.\n\nOver all great experience, good bar food, lots of TVs if you want to watch a game, service and management no issues.  This will probably be our go to place if we want to eat out \"late\" in this area.
0 ||| Receptionist nice and apologetic, however was scheduled for a 6:30p MRI but when we got here it was really a 7:00p appt with a 6:30 check-in to fill out paperwork that literally took 5 minutes. Not respectful of your time.
4 ||| I was looking for a reasonably priced place to get a pedicure since the weather is getting warmer. This place had good reviews and was conveniently located, so I decided to give it a shot. They take reservations and walk-ins. There was only one other customer there when I went, so I was helped right away. The pedicure was well done and the woman who did it was very nice. They even give you a shoulder massage while your nails dry! They only charge $22 for a pedicure and have a very clean salon. I will definitely be coming back here!
3 ||| Always good and it has a very nice atmosphere, especially for the price. The steaks are good and you can't wrong with anything that comes with one of their croissants. Great service as well.
0 ||| Ok.... This was an awful experience!!! A friend and I decided to check thus spot out because we pass it frequently, it was late, we were hungry and it was open. It's was fairly slow with 7 tables or so occupied, however, there was only one waitress. We noticed the food coming out pretty fast which was cool, however, the waitress was AWFUL.... so rude and unprofessional. We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess. We explained we didn't want it and she told us we still would pay for them. After contesting, she grabbed the milkshakes, said something in spanish and walked off. Seconds later, she slams the cups in the sink and began yelling. Luckily, we already had our food!!! From that moment on she had the worst attitude and tossed the bill in the table and walked away!!!! The food was good but the service is the WORST!!!! Yikes!!!!!
3 ||| So good! Simple, fast, good food! They have a huge variety of items in addition to pizza. Salads, chicken fingers, fries, hoagies, stromboli, etc,. \n\nPlus they have online ordering!
2 ||| Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.  The cream stout is tasty.\n\nThe burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  I'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would choke a horse - and almost did.  :o)
4 ||| they have the best soup. tge salsa is amazing. toasted and roasted and whatnot. i like the taco and soup combo. he likes the coastal trio. yum!!!
2 ||| The resort is beautiful but not well maintained. The carpet in the room was stained and there was something smeared on the side of my toilet, which would also not flush unless you held the handle down. The biggest issue is that there was no way to buy water, snacks, cigarettes, etc. after 8pm. You would have to sit at the bar and order or take a 2 mile shuttle to a casino down the road. I've been to plenty of very nice resorts and it's the small things that set the best apart from the crowd, and this resort just didn't have it.
2 ||| I came here when I was 16 looking for information to figure out this whole... gay... thing... with the different groups that they have and activities that they run... they do great things for the community. \n\nWow, I think that I am on my gayest run of Yelp reviews... ever...
0 ||| 3 stars for the food and -2 for the service. They have pathetic service and a shameless staff.
0 ||| I did not try their food but I went in to get an ice tea. It was almost $3 and so old that I took half a sip and dumped it out. Nothing worse than terribly old ice tea!
1 ||| I am not normally big on Pho, but there are times when one could use a good hot broth. I am staying in Vegas for the winter, and tried the Pho at Pho Huong Saigon on Decatur as it is closest to me. The experience there had me thinking there MUST be better Pho around, particularly as this is Las Vegas's asian strip with many Viet Pho places. \n\nSo I  yelped and found the highly rated Pho Sai Gon 8.\n\nI went there and found it to be crowded for the lunch rush - a good sign I thought. I order the chicken Pho, with both white and dark meat. \n\n5 minutes later the Pho arrived, packed with meat and noodles. I dug in.\n\nThe good:\n\n- Excellent quantity of food. \n- Lotsa flavor.\n\n\nThe not so good\n\n- The broth was oily and the saltiness reeked of MSG. For the first time ever eating Pho, I didnt drink most of the broth.\n- The meat was tough and remained so as it sat in the broth.\n- The service was perfunctory, with the crowds of people. I left a dollar because someone did come along and refilled my water, otherwise I was left alone.\n- The Pho was pricey at 7.50 for a large bowl.\n\nFor the first time ever leaving a Pho place, I left unfulfilled and wanting food. I considered going to the cheap and cheerful BBQ King chinese joint behind Pho Saigon 8, but settled for a sardine Bahn Mi at the little bakery in the mall.\n\nWith all the choices around on Spring Mountain, I wont be back at Pho Saigon 8.
3 ||| Always consistently good.  This last visit I had the Thai steak and noodle salad.  I think it's my new favorite!
1 ||| We brought my husband's brand new BMW 335i in just last month after he was rear-ended on the freeway. They told us it would be two weeks, two and a half max. Over a month later we finally have the car back but the interior, which used to have a nice new car smell, now reeks of BO from the workers. Gross. Also, when we dropped the car off, they had a deal on their website boasting 50% off your deductible up to $500, yet when my husband went to pick up his car yesterday no such deal was offered. They should have honored the deal that was advertised when we dropped the car off at least - then take into account it took twice as long as they predicted and we were paying for a rental car that entire time! \n\n I've also taken my BMW X3 to them when I was hit from the side and it took twice as long with my vehicle as well. Their communication during the process leaves much to be desired and my car still has a rattle ever since the accident. Definitely not ideal - but if you have a ton of time on your hands to wait around for your car, dont care if you get screwed out of promotions, or your car is returned with a digusting odor or rattle then feel free to take your car here.
4 ||| My 3 year old has been coming here for over a year now. It has been a great experience every time!! Veronica does a really great job!!
4 ||| Great little place!  The waiter was amazing and took great care of us! He wasn't annoyed with \"out of towners\" and was happy to talk with us about more than the menu. Food was awesome too! It's off the beaten path but so worth the trip! They have karaoke one night and were bummed we missed it.
2 ||| Is it normal for \"Thai-style chicken\" to look like pineapple? \n\nJust got back from lunch with my co-worker.  It was nearby, had decent reviews and I wanted Chinese. My co-worker, whose Chinese, jumped at the opportunity to go to a new place for lunch nearby since she usually only goes to places her friends recommend.  Overall - it was ok-good. Staff was friendly - suggested what I try. Co-Worker (CW) was excited about the Thai menu. She'd been talking about Hot & Sour soup and hasn't found any in PHX she likes except one place in the far away land of Chandler (compared to West PHX). \n\nHOneslty, she seemed a little disappointed in the food. Hot & Sour soup (from the Chinese menu, not the Thai H&S) was sour, but not hot. She had me try, and I'm no hot & sour judge, but it had some funky (read: not good) taste to it. They brought a wonton and egg roll with her #7 Thai combo (can't remember what it was called). Both were overfried. She mentioned it's like it was fried then refried. HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad. \n\nMoving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking. Is it normal for the chicken to look like pineapple? That threw me off - it was cubed and had a yellow-ish tint. It was very soft too - gave me a weird I like/don't like feeling. But i continued to eat and overall, I liked it. \n\nMy CW got the #7 Thai special that came in a bowl. Had lots of veggies, chicken in some creamy spicy sauce. She had me try the sauce and it was pretty good (I wish I had taken more to put on my meal from her bowl when she offered). I'm not so sure she enjoyed the place as much and I'm not surprised. At the end of our meal she mentioned she'd like to find a \"really good\" Chinese place to take us to and was going to talk to her friends. \n\nI wouldn't mind going back to try the Chinese menu - they have a huge selection and it's nearby, a great price for lunch, not busy and pretty friendly.
0 ||| Even though Los Tacos is one of my favorite taco stands in Las Vegas. I went there today at 8:10pm, waited at the drive thru menu for 10min. Thought maybe it was broke. Drove up to the window, 6 employees were standing behind the counter. I honked the horn several times and tried to waive them down. They ignored me like I didn't exist. This wasn't the first time I arrived before 9pm which is the time that's posted that they close and they closed early. They could of at least had the decency to tell me they were closed, don't ignore me when you know I'm there. Now I see why Tacos El Gordos next store remains busy. It's not just the quality of food, it's also the appreciation and respect of your loyal customers!
0 ||| Service was awful. We didn't have \"call ahead seating or reservations\" so it was a 80 minute wait.  Finally sat down. Then wait  20 mins and still no apps. I was asked if I had any questions about the menu.  I asked the waitress and she tells me their Salmon is farm raised.  I am sorry I am not going to pay $$$ for farm raised crap.  We had enough and left before the 20 minute onion ring app came out.
4 ||| This place is owned by a very nice couple. It is very clean and they have good prices. The dryers work exceptionally well, I dried a HUGE load for not even 20 minutes and it was bone dry. Highly recommend this place. They also do 1$/pound wash,dry,fold.
1 ||| Have you ever had authentic Mexican food that makes you smile just thinking about it? Yeah-me too. Unfortunately, this pretender is the exact opposite of authentic! Shame on you Willy and Jose for serving this crap.\n\nHere is what I did like......\n\nThe available seating in the courtyard of Sam's Town is pretty cool- it felt like I was on vacation. Within minutes, chips and a mild salsa were brought to our table. I enjoyed the salsa, but didn't care much for the bean dip that came along with it. Ok-that's all the positive things I can say about this place.\n\nFor dinner, I selected the green burrito. The menu described it as chile verde (slow roasted pork) with beans inside of a large flour tortilla topped with melted cheese and green sauce. Here is the problem, the chile verde was lacking any flavor at all. Most versions of this dish have onions, peppers, and spices infused throughout. All I could taste here was meat, cheese, and a soggy tortilla. Perhaps the soaking wet lettuce and over ripe tomatoes that accompanied my dish had something to do with this watered down entree. I am so sick of Mexican restaurants trying to pass this off as some delicious salad. All this does is create a puddle in the middle of my plate and turn the cheese into a curdled mess. The rice and beans were atrocious. The rice tasted like that boxed crap from rice a roni, and the beans were boring and chalky.\n\nThe service at this restaurant was OK. Three different people brought things out, so I couldn't really tell who our server was. I did ask one of the employees if they made their own tortillas and her response was \" I don't know\". Hah? \n\nOur bill came out to a little more than $ 30.00 for two entrees and two sodas. Overpriced for mediocre food! I'd rather have my dog pass gas in my face than eat at this place again.....
2 ||| To be blunt, I'm baffled at the amount of love the burgers here received on Yelp.  Really just not that good.  The meat was dry and overcooked, the toppings were boring and it was pretty small.  The only reason this place received 3 stars from me was the OUTSTANDING soup!  The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious.  I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup--yea, it was that good!  Overall, the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old (kind of like the burgers taste), but, do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup!
3 ||| We checked in yesterday and chose the Fiesta Rancho because we are here for a hockey camp that is held in the hotel's ice arena. I was a bit worried after reading other reviews that said it was smoky and dirty. I was happily surprised. I've stayed at the Venetian and New York New York and this casino is not much smoker than those. It definitely seems to have a ventilation system.  I have never smoked and am sensitive to smoke but honestly it's fine. It is a casino after all!  The staff has been very friendly and helpful. I was playing a machine and noticed staff going around cleaning, straightening chairs.  The rink isn't too cold for spectators, even in summer clothes.\n\nFood: my teenager is happy that there is a SubWay, Panda Express, and Denny's right inside the hotel/casino. We had a nice Mexican dinner at a Mexican restaurant in the casino last night with yummy coconut margaritas. They put toasted coconut around the rim with honey.  We haven't tried the buffet. They have Italian, Mongolian, not sure what else.\n\nCleanliness: like I say, they're cleaning a lot in the casino. My room smelled very clean, even a little bleachy when we arrived. The shower is a little worn, but I don't care. They have a non-smoking area of the casino. No tables in that section, just machines. Public bathrooms in the casino are large, modern (lots of tile), and very clean. The carpet in the Denny's is a bit trashed looking but the Denny's is otherwise clean. They decorate a lot and have left lots of adhesive stuff on the walls. Weird, but not an issue.\n\nRoom: clean, basic. No microwave, coffee pot, or fridge. They do have wall outlets handy, which is sometimes not so even in more expensive hotels. I have a view of a parking lot, abandoned drive-in and a billboard advertising a Hawaiian buffet. No free Wi-Fi. I think it's $6 for 24hrs. I'm using the hot spot on my phone. No conditioner.  Newer, up-to-date bedding. Air conditioner works great. Plenty cool in there.\n\nLocation: 22 min North from McCarren Airport  on MapQuest.  10min North of Downtown/Fremont Street Experience.  Next to Texas Station, same property owner. Texas Station has a bowling alley, theatre, Starbucks.  People say their buffet is good.\n\nTransportation: taxis on site. We took the 106 bus from a bus stop across the street and rode 20min south to Downtown last night to go to the Fremont Street Experience. The bus was running every 30min. $2 for single trip. $3 for 2-hr pass. $5 all day. There is a 24-hr \"Deuce\" shuttle between Downtown and the Strip. It's over 100 degrees, so it was hot waiting but there is a small bus shelter. Not bad.\n\nPool: basic, small, clean.  Clean towels provided poolside but no food, drinks, or dressing area.\n\nCasino: a few card tables, lots of  machines, a Keno runner circulating at least thru Denny's, a Keno machine area, several bars, a large Bingo hall.  I had an issue with my machine so lit the call button. The guy was there in about 10seconds to re-boot it. Very friendly. There's a bar in the center of the casino; not walled in.\n\nThis is not as upscale as properties on the strip, but it's not on the strip.  Smoky? Yeah, but not bad. I would come back!\n\n-AC
3 ||| Great food, Great beer and the best service in Henderson!! Had terrible service 1 time. That was the only time I  saw that server, so management is obviously paying attention. ALL the rest of the servers are great!!! And HAPPY HOUR is truly HAPPY!!!!
0 ||| I always walked by this place and wondered if I should try.  I love middle eastern cuisine.  One day, I went here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers.  The place was packed and the menu was short, which were good signs of a good restaurant.  I ordered the kibbeh and it was just disgusting.  I've had so much better elsewhere.  It was very dry and tasteless.  The only real attraction to this place is the student pricing.  Dishes here are quite cheap.  Now I see why.
2 ||| I drive by daily and after a few years finally went to the restaurant. It was like sitting in a cigarette ashtray.\nFood was inexpensive and passable. Service was okay. I would not go back because of the stench of cigarettes. I know nothing of the casino or any other casino.
1 ||| This place has been around a long time, and I've been there quite a few times. It's hard to find decent Cajun food in Phoenix, but Kay's usually does pretty well.\n\nOur last visit wasn't the greatest. The duck & andouille gumbo was nice, if not quite piping hot. I forgave that, as it's one of the few places around you cna find duck of any kind, or andouille for that matter. The shrimp etouffe came out stone cold, and the waitress quickly returned it to the kitchen where they nuked it to almost hot. Microwaved etouffee just isn't right. \n\nAn order of dirty rice with a side of 2 links of andouille proved almost pointless, as we specifically made clear this was an entree, and expected the 2 links to be cut up and added to the rice. What we got was a small bowl of dirty rice with two tiny breakfast-sized links laid atop it.  \n\nThe crab cakes weren't bad, being mostly crab with little bread crumbs, but they really didn't scream authentic cajun cakes to me. Plus, they too were a bit on the cold side - even though everything came out quickly. \n\nOn the plus side, they have Abita beers on tap. Turbo Dog is always welcomed - especially if it's on tap. \n\nAnother plus is you can stop in on a weekend night (we went on a Saturday) even at 9p and they are open. The place was empty barring a few people at the bar. That should be your clue. \n\nMy previous experiences here were all around lunchtime, with no problems as far as food temp, so I suspect that late night diners are getting food that has been sitting around in a steamer all day long. \n\nRegardless, I am only giving this 2 stars. Your mileage may vary.
0 ||| Normally I am a huge fan of this chain.  However, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to.  The calimari we ordered came out full of grease and fried batter. The waiter Noah told my pregnant wife that she should drink more water because it is good for inflammation. Seriously, about wanted to punch him in the face.  My order was brought out with the wrong side.  Was told this would be fixed, never was!!  One whole dollar was taken off our order!!! Food was average at best...stay away from this location!!
2 ||| We called ahead and made reservations because we had 10 people in our party for dinner.  We all arrived at 7:45 pm and or table was ready and waiting for us. The place was pretty packed for a Thursday night. \n\nAs soon as we sat down we were served chips and salsa then our waiter came to our table and took our drink orders.\n\nI have three standards when it comes to judging Mexican restaurants beans, rice and salsa. These three items will tell you whether or not you are in a quality Mexican restaurant. Thankfully, all three passed my test. \n\n(1) The salsa- The salsa here is to die for. WARNING: The chips & salsa here is addicting. I could make a meal out of their salsa and chips they were so awesome. The chips were crispy, tasty served hot and so fresh. Their salsa adds a zing to anything you put it on. The best part is they are FREE with an entr\u00e9e .\n(2) Beans- the beans was cooked to perfection. They were very tasteful.\n(3) Rice - was cooked perfectly. They tasted homemade. \n\nAll ten people got something different. By the silence during dinner they all enjoyed their meals. Afterwards everyone commented how they ate to much chis and salsa because they were so good and how delicious everything was.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I went against my usual instincts and ordered something new and different. I got the  Carne Macha (Shredded beef saut\u00e9ed with fresh tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, and a special seasoning. Served with guacamole, rice, beans and choice of corn or flour tortillas). The Macha beef was overdone, dried out and looked burnt. I ate everything except the beef. Thank goodness I had chips & salsa to fill me up. I told our waiter how disappointed I was with the beef and pointed out I ate everything else. He offered to get me something different. I declined because everyone else was just finishing their meals. Later he took the meal off the bill.\n\nThe atmosphere is very festive and vibrant. The only thing keeping me from granting a 4 star rating is my meal was not to my liking. If my meal was expectable / enjoyable I would have given it a rating of 4. \n\nFOOD: The portions were ample so if you're a big eater you'll be pleased. They use fresh ingredients and their entrees look very inviting. Salsa and chips (complementary) is praiseworthy. Flavorfully spiced with a nice consistency, I wanted to take home a 5 gallon bucket of this stuff. The rice here is perfect!  AMBIANCE: The restaurant is really interesting to look at. You can tell that the owners take great pride in the restaurant.  They took the time to nicely decorate the restaurant although the d\u00e9cor is what you'd expect in a Mexican restaurant.  PRICE: Average for a quality Mexican restaurant. SERVICE: Our waiter and his helper were both very friendly attentive and efficient . CONCLUSION: characteristic d\u00e9cor. The atmosphere is great. Portions are big.  I enjoyed this place -- food, price, service, atmosphere -- everything you'd want.  Highly recommended  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%.\n\n    ***************** What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT
4 ||| I stopped by Flemings for a Saturday night dinner with a couple of friends. I had reservations, so even though it was busy, we were actually seated 15 prior to my reservation time. The atmosphere was as I expected, although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected. \n\nThe service was excellent. The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent! One friend and I ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with Fleming's potatoes. My other friend ordered the regular sized filet mignon with a baked potato. I have never seen a larger potato. My two friends each had a salad - one Caesar and house salad. The salads were each around $9, but good size. The regular filet mignon was $32, while the petite with the potatoes was $26. I didn't really think the regular size was that much larger than the petite. \n\nThe steak was phenomenal! I ordered it medium and I can't recall a better steak that I have ever had. It was cooked well, excellent flavor and the perfect size.  The server continued to fill our drinks, brought a second loaf of bread and made sure we had everything we needed.\n\nThe total of 3 diet drinks, 2 salads, a baked potato, 1 regular filet mignon and 2 petite filet mignons with the included Fleming potato was $135. Not bad for 3 people. I will definitely come back again.
1 ||| I don't eat breakfast often, but when I do, I like it to be large, filling, and cheap.  That being said, I was disappointed in JP for two reasons -  service and value.  Although the pancakes are excellent, the breakfasts are overpriced for what you get.  My bacon was undercooked, but the personable waitress volunteered to take the bacon and have it cooked some more.\n\nEven with that, the service was terrible.   Once she served the customers, she would play cards with the cook. I had to remind her that she took my bacon to be recooked; and also had to ask for a refill on my coffee. I guess the card game was too fascinating!\n\nAlthough this location is not far from where I live, I doubt I will be going back.
4 ||| One the best restaurants around. Of course, since you are the chef, I encourage newbies to follow the instructions on the board for the sauces or you will be the only cook  you can blame for the bad experience. I have my favorite combination of sauces for the best taste. Occasionally a long line but, who wants to eat at a restaurant that no one likes?\n\nA must eat
1 ||| Been going here since I was a kid.  Pizza has always sucked.  Cheap and greasy with an abundance of uncooked dough to make up for the meager toppings.  Best thing going for it is the cup of sauce to dip your nearly sauce-less slice in.  Still I go every few months when I get a hankering, and then I am disappointed and sick afterwards.
1 ||| we ordered the chicken and rice, they used chicken breast which is very un typical..so dry........im not sure which peice of the chicken other Viet restaurants use but its not the breast , its a piece thats juicy and yummy ! and than aftwards a few of us got a stomach after.Lol. Went here cuz our white cab driver told us it was good. lols I think the food here leaning a tiny bit towards fusion. Anyways it is the nicest Pho restaurant I've seen compared to Vancouver.
3 ||| Costco rocks.  I love the shopping experience and always discover something new when I'm there.  I'm really into the fresh deli section here.  I got some salmon with dill butter and seasonings, threw it in the oven and had a delicious meal - easy gourmet masterpiece.  I don't go as often as I would like due to the huge portions.  It is great to bring a friend along and split things.\n\nThe location in executive park is a little out of the way, so I usually have to plan out a trip versus stop by.  FYI, if you want to miss the crowds it is a relative ghost town weekdays at 5:30.\n\nReminder: you can only use Amex, debit or cash - so come prepared!
3 ||| Well, some dishes are good and some dishes are not so good.  Portions on the small side compared with ACE and Mekong Palace a mile north.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4.
0 ||| I would put NO STARS or negative 5 stars if I could!  People here are RUDE!!  Called to inquire about a grill and was on hold for a while, not the problem, when a lady finally answered the call, I told her I was calling to see if they have a certain product I was looking for... Her response..., \"what?, I don't know?  Hold on.\"  Then she hung up on me!  I called back, to try it again, a man answers, said, \"ummm, hold on.\"  Then hung up on me again!  So, nevermind, will look elsewhere!
3 ||| The zoo is really nice and the staff are very friendly!
4 ||| We've been going to Santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house. We've never had a bad item here. It's a fun place to go and the food is great. We always order pizza which is consistently good. Their salads are excellent - all their ingredients are very fresh and there's enough for two meals if you're a lighter eater. And the wings are always excellent. \n\nWe've always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming. It's a great place to watch a game - if you can get in! Friday and Saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our take-out pizza. The parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and there's a dollar theater next door. You can park in back (the side toward the freeway) if there's no room in the front.\n\nWe moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and Santisi was still there, and as good as ever.
4 ||| I am born and raised in NY and pizza is my favorite food.  So I have high pizza standards.  This pizza is the best in PIttsburgh and right up there with the best places in NY.  The sausage comes in crumbles, and tastes like it has to be home made.  Not the manufactured balls or slices you see at other places.  There is plenty of cheese and it has just the right amount of salt.  Although it's a little pricey you definitely get your money's worth.  You will get stuffed from 2-3 slices.  I usually eat half the pie at which point I have trouble breathing but it's worth it.  The best part though is the sauce... it is like crack.  I could drink a bowl of it.  Just writing this is making my mouth water.  Also, they have a large assortment of bottled beer that's reasonably priced.  And there's plenty of seating with a low-key, simple, old-fashioned pizza shop feel to it.  I've been here many times with friends and they all love it too.  I've only eaten in, and that's how I'd recommend eating it... fresh out of the oven.  You will not be disappointed.
0 ||| I've been a patient for years till today, I went in for my yearly checkup and the staff announced loudly to a filled waiting room if the dr sees me he won't get paid.\n\n I have a steady job with a large  govt agency, I have insurance and I pay my bills. What insurance won't cover my other drs just bill me for, it's never more than $20.   I think you even sign something that you are responsible, and I've never refused to pay.\n\nFirst she  said I had an HMO,then story changed that I can see only Sierra providers( wrong and wrong,I have a PPO with out of network benefits I can see any provider and they will get paid).   Besides I told them what kind of insurance I had at the time of the appt. but they said they forgot to check that it was covered.  I even called my provider there in the hallway and they said I was covered.\n\nDuring part of this the dr himself was out in the office area, he  looked uncomfortably  at the ground when he walked past and wouldn't  meet my eyes.\n\n If  we are going to scream for money what about my lost income for the 1.5 hours I took off to go out there.  I think I will send him a bill for my time.\n\nMy confidence is shaken, if they can be wrong about my insurance what if there are mistakes about something serious like medical test results.
3 ||| I'm from LA. Nothing will ever compare to Johnny Pastrami but this satisfies me pretty good until then. Husband gets the Capastrami, which i have to admit looked AMAZING. However I wanted a regular Hot Pastrami, not on the menu but they made it for me. :) Enough of each sauce, pickles and $20 for 2 medium (footlong) subs. We eat here about once a month for our Pastrami cravings, no complaints. YUM.
2 ||| The food was good and I really thought the atmosphere was fitting, but I just really didn't think that the red chili burrito lived up to all of the hype that I heard about it. I will definitely come back to try more food though.
0 ||| I can't even believe this is the same place we are all reviewing. I went last Thursday with my co-workers and was promised authentic, cheap, hole-in the wall in all its glory Mexican food.\n\nWhile I will say the decor and weight staff seemed authentic - the food tasted horrible.\n\nWe were given three salsas. The first was a bit too spicy for my taste ( I am a solid medium fan) , the second was normal salsa but nothing to rave about, and the third tasted like my co-worker said  \"a Bloody Mary on my chip\" basically entirely too watery. \n\nI ordered a beef Chimichanga. Now a Chimichanga should be crispy as it is fried but this fell flat- it tasted like it was reheated in a microwave! The meat itself was scary looking (wasnt ground-or really shredded either just gross chunks ...yucky). 7 out of 8 of us made comments about the scary looking meat that filled our various Mexican entrees. I was told the chicken tasted like Chinese food -take that as you will. The rice and beans were the one part I did enjoy.\n\nOverall my meal was $10 - and yucky. I will not be going back.
2 ||| I agree: this place is just A-OK. But it's still A-OK! \n\nEfficient check in, though they are less outwardly welcoming to Diamond and Platinum members than other properties seem to be, but nonetheless professional. We chose the arrival amenity--bottle of wine and prosciutto sandwiches--which was outstanding. Among the best I've experienced, actually. The prosciutto sandwiches were more like flatbreads, freshly baked with fresh arugula piled high. Would serve as a light lunch for two. Great gym, but mediocre pool--but then, it's a downtown business hotel. But still. Excellent late night drink specials at the revolving--yep, that's right, revolving!--bar and restaurant on the top floor. \n\nSo, all in all, good for a quick stay or a positioning stay before or after a flight, but I wouldn't make a vacation out of this one. For that, see my review of the Scottsdale property--fantastic!
3 ||| This place is a chill dive bar. They have a number of arcade games and pool tables to keep you busy if you don't want to stare at a television. Also they sell burgers at 99cents a pop during NFL games and they're not bad at all. Friendly bartenders round this place off. As far as dive bars go, this place is awesome.
3 ||| I can't speak for going through TSA, because this is always a transfer spot for me, but changing planes, and finding your next gate, is a breeze!! When given the option, I always choose Douglas when planning a flight with a layover.
0 ||| Must have been good at some point but not when I was there.\n\nYou could hear the 2 employees complain the whole time.  They should have been watching the food instead.  Garlic knots were hard as weapons and the pizza crust was burnt cardboard.\n\nNever again.
4 ||| Suffered from painful TMJ disorder for years...Some days the muscles in my jaw would tighten all the way to my trapezoid area...I tried everything - Dentists, Doctors, Medication...I made literally two visits to Dr. Olson in the Fall of 2010 - And I have been cured ever since! Highly recommend, especially if you are suffering from TMJ!
4 ||| Huge menu! Lots of gluten free and vegetarian options. Friendly staff, beautiful dinnerware. I'm their newest regular!
2 ||| Closed :(
0 ||| I'm sorry for causing the 5-star rating to go down, but I had a bad experience here. A while ago, I came to this branch just to deposit a check. I don't know what it is with the Wells Fargo branches in Las Vegas, but there seems to be a serious lack of envelope-free ATMs here. I guess I was spoiled when living in Southern California. I rarely had to step into the bank because any check deposited through those envelope-free ATMs would post to your account the same day and the funds would be available immediately.\n\nAnyway, I'll be nice and not name the teller and personal banker that helped me that day. They were trying to get me to open another account with them. I had to stand there and listen to them explain how every customer should have 5-6 different accounts under their name because of security reasons, all those scams going on, etc., etc. Don't get me wrong, I understand what they were trying to say and believe me, if I was a millionaire and had nothing better to do, I would love to put all that money in 10 different accounts. But it was a busy day for me, I had tons of stuff to do, and I really didn't have time to hang out at the bank. So I politely declined, thanked them for the information and told them that I would definitely keep that in mind. A few days later I noticed that they opened 2 new accounts under my name without my permission! WTF?! I called the branch and talked to the manager. She was actually very nice, apologized to me, got everything resolved and told me that she would have a talk with those two employees.  \n\nThat's scary knowing that they have shady employees here, so watch out! I'm avoiding this branch forever!
0 ||| I ordered a pattern 15 days ago and payment was made.  I call the phone # listed an no one answers.  I have forwarded the email sent to me that they got the order and payment, to follow up.  I also emailed to the address linked to my invoice and still no response.  I want the patter or, damn it send my money back.  I see wonderful revies but I can't do that with the issue at hand.\nI'm hoping this makes someone hop to it. I ordered the pattern by judydidit, gone to the dogs.
3 ||| Gotta love a place that has an \"We love yelpers\", sticker right there on their front window!! Haven't been to a jamba in years now. Totally worth stopping in for after a crazy morning.\n\nFresh fruit and juices were everywhere in the store. Squeezed and blended right in front of you, makes the experience all the better. Prices are affordable considering what you're coming in to order. Whether this location or another jamba get yourself a wheatgrass shot, worth it!
0 ||| I came in for an oil change with a coupon for $15 off. There were 2 service  advisers at the counter when I presented the coupon the adviser that wasn't waiting on me looked on to see if my advisor imputing the job correctly in the computer. I took note of this and went to the waiting area. After a short wait I was presented with the bill which was a few cents less than my last oil change and I let them know it. Immediately they both scrambled to fix what they had been caught doing. What they did was increase the oil change by $10 and add a $5 surcharge, but I had my last bill to prove to them and confronted them about it. Beware of this scam
1 ||| Sam Woo was one few Chinese Restaurants you'll find in the late 80s and 90s in LV. So if you went there back in the day, you'd give it a 4 star. Now, there are just too many other places to go. \n\nIf you want cheap food and don't mind the hair and cig ashes in your food, then this is the place you want to be. (just kidding, no ashes or hair were found in the food) Quick and easy. I'm not bothered by the place since I can tell me kids that I used to come here as a kid. Pretty nostalgic I guess. \n\nDon't expect anything awesome.
3 ||| Nice little zoo.  The monkey house is pretty awesome!   The Haunted Zoo thing during Halloween is fun!
3 ||| I had one of the funnest nights out with a friend here once. Since then, I've had hit and miss nights. First of all, for anyone planning to stop in here, this is one of THE smokiest bars in the city. I'm not a smoker, so when I go out I at least like to know what I'm getting into (and realizing that my clothes will be unwearable the next day). However, this place is a hole in the wall on Forbes in Squirrel Hill, and it's a great place to grab some friends, grab a booth, and grab a pitcher or two for a night. I'm not sure if they still do this, but they use to have board game nights where a different game is placed at each booth.  Board games + beer = perfect night of fun. I've had some good bar food there as well, and from I remember it's not too pricey. There is a great selection of bottled beer, and a pretty average tab variety. I do remember the service not being incredible, but as long as you're with your peeps and do pitchers, you'll be happy. The wood booths and tables give the bar a homey, smokey feel. There is also an upstairs that is open from time to time if the place gets crazy. I've had trouble before finding a booth open on a Saturday night.
3 ||| I have to give this place a 4 star as I'm a dim sum lover. The dim sums were always hot and fresh-especially their chicken feet. I like their chili oil the best. My bf especially can't get over it and tried to get their recipe every time we went  there. Other than dim sum their other dishes were quite impressive too. The beef mushroom w shacha sauce pot-yum! Still exploring new stuff will update soon as I tried more!
4 ||| Such a cool place, everyone is really nice and the bartenders are super fun! They have a lot of events!! Would totally recommend if people are looking for a local bar!
0 ||| Misrepresented their prices.  The sign said new oil filter was included then they charged $9 extra because my Jeep was a \"premium\" oil filter.  The \"manager\" said he would hold my keys from me until I paid in full.  I told him I was feeling taken advantage of and he said that was unfair.  Do not go here.  Drive to the Jiffy Lube.  This place took advantage of me and they knew it.
2 ||| Been here for 4 days, got 3 more to go.\nSo far its not bad for what it is...a place to stay when you gotta stay somewhere for a minute.  \nThe room is decently sized.\nThe bed is actually pretty darn comfy, and I want to stuff the pillows in my suitcase.\nThe kitchenette is a great value.  It comes with a 2 burner stove, a sink, fridge/freezer, microwave, cooking utensils, and a little coffee maker with coffee provided.\nDecent sized bathroom with decent shower head.  \nSmall tv with ESPN galore and a few other stations.\nNice little workstation/dining counter.\nWifi.\nMy room was pretty clean.  I haven't seen any big bugs, just 2 small little 'things'...barely even saw'em.  \nThe air works fine and is controlled on the wall which is nice.\nThe only issue I have is the same issue that you get in most budget hotels....seediness.  Shady characters abound, but this is to be expected.  Some might even peg me as shady as they peek out of their curtain, who knows.  The main thing is noise througout the night.  Not shouting and stuff (did experience a shouting match one night, but that's it so far), but just bumpity-bump-bump at all times of the night.  Sounds like big foot is walking around next to me with insomnia.\nThe area is not that bad.  Its still Phoenix, though.  The 17 is right down the street, and there is also a LONG WONG'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET!!!!  \nAn El Rancho Market is also within walking distance, and they've got some good goodies there.\nManagement was awesome, though I've only dealt with them at check-in.\nI checked in Saturday, room service comes Wednesday, and I leave Saturday.  So they come around in the middle, which is good enough for me.  I'll see how they perform.\nNot bad at all for the price.  If you don't mind the thin insulation and Pookie'nem, then this is an alright stay for a week or two.  The rates are a little higher for night-to-night, so...  Also, there's easy access to the 17, Central Ave, and LOOOOONG WOOOOOOONG'S!!!!!\nUpdated coming closer to check-out...
0 ||| This is undoubtably the worst car wash place I have ever been to. I bought the groupon now which is only available on weekdays so I couldn't use it. The girl at the cash register was unhelpful and every thing is over priced. Not to mention the nickle and dime u for everything here and the service is incredibly slow. I will never go back
2 ||| Ok. It's close to my home. It's close to my business. But it's not close to my heart. While I find most of the staff passibly friendly, some are frankly, annoying. Case in point. Employee is ringing up my order and asks if I want the extended warranty. I decline. She asks me if I was having a good day. I said, absolutely, I always have a good day. Then she informs me that this was her Friday. And I said, me too! Here goes. She asks me if I was going to \"take my work home with me\" and I responded, sort of channeling Whitney Houston from Being Bobby Brown, \"Oh, hell no!\". She immediately, shusshes me while raising her hand, eyebrows furrowed (sp?) and says \"Don't say words like that!\" I knew she was offended by my use of the \"h\" \"e\" double hockey sticks word, was embarrassed slightly for a moment and then just pissed. I could only muster up the stink eye for her as any clever words of disdain eluded  me. All I could think of when I got in to my car was, \"Oh hell yea, I'm yelping her ass as soon as I can.\" I don't wanna name names but it starts with R, has an L and a V and a few vowels in between. Oh, the power of the internet.
3 ||| I like Jack in The Box. Good fast food. This particular location is in a very dicey part of town. Drug dealers, hookers and hoes, and homeless people standing near property. As I was leaving parking lot I was approached by homeless man.
3 ||| love the Pastrami and Corned Beef!
1 ||| Heard about Los Olivos from a friend who had been to the original one. They had nothing but good things to say so we decided to check it out. \n\nNothing about this place impressed me. The food was average at best and the service was terrible. We had ordered margaritas and I guess the waitress forgot to bring them buy. When we had asked for them again she told us she forgot and that it was just sitting at the bar so she would be right back. I was surprised when she brought it back because most of the ice was already melted, I figured she would bring us a fresh one but I was wrong. She didn't seem to care when I mentioned how my frozen margarita was now a lukewarm margarita.\n\nThat being said, I can put up with bad service at a restaurant when the food is good but I have had better Mexican at Taco Bell. The only reason I am giving two stars is because it was at least decently priced.
0 ||| This place is terrible.  It's a dive bar that stinks and it seems like a funeral home.  \n\nThe draft beer made me sick.  It tasted like they hadn't cleaned the lines in years.  \n\nMy friends like to drink and they all walked out without finishing their drinks.  \n\nAwful, close the place!!!\n\nThanks
3 ||| Okay, people need to lay off this place! Coming from an Indian family, I know good Indian food. The food is great and the servers are often nice. Yes, I agree that sometimes they can be a little off but they are never rude or pushy. My old floormate and I loved going to India Garden whenever we got the chance. She always got the Chicken Tikka Masala (which is really really good) and I love their lamb/goat curry with Basmati Rice. The flavors are fantastic! You can really taste authentic Indian food here. If you're not a fan of spicy food then you can surely make a request to not have the peppers added to your dish. They're always happy to comply. My friend lovesss the Gulab Jamuns. Ive tried the mango ice cream but it didn't really do anything for me. \n\nIf you do go to India Garden, make sure you go at least once during the dinner or lunch buffets. One word: DELICIOUS. Everything is so fresh and great and you leave completely stuffed! All for just $8.99! Perfect for a college student's budget. If you can't get there during the buffet times, don't worry, the rest of the menu is really fairly priced. \n\nIndia Garden is definitely the first place I'm going once I get back to Pittsburgh in a few days!
1 ||| Lunch time service is virtually non existant, which is quite annoying when u just drove 10 hours, tired, and hungry.  The only reason i didnt give them a 1 star is cuz the food is decent.
4 ||| My son went to McCormick Preschool from 6 weeks old until after he started school and he loved it there.  The kids are in separate classrooms, with kids the same age, learning valuable educational and social skills.  My son benefited greatly from the teachers at McCormick and still remembers all of them, especially getting his Red Vines when he left everyday from Ms. Barbara.  Most of the teachers there are career teachers and not just showing up for work every day.  They really care about the kids who go there.\n\nThe school has Christmas parties every year with families, food and a visit from Santa.  Holidays are all celebrated with parties full of hand-made decorations, songs, crafts and costumes!  Lots of photos are taken of the kids so parents can share in their growth and daytime activities.  Besides being a really fun place for the kids to be, the McCormick Preschool van gives the kids rides to and from school everyday.  This service made it possible for me to work an uninterrupted day while my son was taken care of for the entire day.   There was even a graduation ceremony with a cap and gown!\n\nI read a REALLY long and negative review on Yelp about McCormick and have to wonder if someone that worries about bacteria in the dirt their child plays in could ever be satisfied with someone else's care of her child.  I have always taken my child's safety very seriously, but that's just weird.\n\nMcCormick Preschool is an amazing school and even though my son graduated a few years ago, I am still proud to have the school in my neighborhood.\n\nI recommend McCormick Preschool 100%!
4 ||| The Eggs Benedict is just delicious. Their hash browns are unique and also very tasty.
0 ||| This place sucked.  The people seemed to be mostly older.  Age 35 and up. The younger ones were mostly ugly and or fat.\n\nThe had a dance floor and a DJ. The music choice sucked. It was rap and country.  It was almost to get service since I wasn't a regular.\n\nI would not bring friends here unless they were old or ugly.
2 ||| Not a bad spot, open late and had good beer available.
1 ||| Ordered the Big Unit and was really dissapointed this time.   When a restaurant is charging over $10 for a hot dog, it should have some flavor.  The bun was dry/stale, and the dog was barely cooked.  \n\nFor that kind of money the chilli, cheese, onions, etc should all be served on the same trough that the dog comes on.  Make it gourmet for pete's sake since you are charging like crazy.  Also, it doesn't have to be two feet long.  Nobody can eat that.  It is gross.
2 ||| After arriving to my Ramada hotel on E Van Buren after a nighttime airplane flight, it was around 8PM and this part of town north of the airport is absolutely dead on a weekday night.  Luckily Bill Johnson's was open because who knows how much further I would have had to walk to get to a place to grub on some late night food?\n\nThe cobb salad I got was ginormous and for the price (less than $10), it was quite a satisfying late night filler.  All that chicken, feta cheese, lettuce, and bacon bits made me very happy going back to my hotel afterward.  I couldn't help but notice that many of the weekly steak specials were a helluva deal but I can't speak for how good they really are.  I was the last one eating in the restaurant and the staff there was very patient and not rushing to get me out of the restaurant.
0 ||| Refusal to give a kid a courtesy cup of water! We live in Arizona & from what I understand it was 100\u00b0F today, the kid was drenched in sweat and you would not give him a cup of water?? WOW  making $0.50 is apparently more important than helping prevent a heat stroke. Did I mention it was for a kid?! Unbelievable!!!!!
2 ||| I think Champions is the only real bar in Gilbert. It's worth a trip for the clientele along - moslyt the Bud Light vs Coors Light crowd. Lots of pool tables plus 6 or so dart boards. This isn't an upscale establishment ... but is a great place to go for a few cheap drinks in a friendly atmosphere.
1 ||| There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma...
1 ||| Rock Bottom continues to earn it's name. I have been to this location on 5 separate occasions because my partner likes the beer varieties and the Pretzels. He has stopped telling me we are headed here because I will get them to change their mind before we arrive. After this last visit I told them that there are no more redeeming factors for me at this restaurant and I am not returning.\n\nChicken Oscar ~ belongs right in the trash with its muppet fur of shredded canned crab meat stuffed inside. Special of the night? It was a disaster and took forever to prepare. When I got it the chicken was dry and burnt all on the bottom. I could easily split the chicken open and see that the stuffing was a light smear of obvious canned shredded clam. The asparagus was hard and over buttered and the mashed potatoes were heavy and uninspired. It took so long and I couldn't get the waitstaff attention to bother returning it or thinking of more food to try. \nMy partner had a burger, it was nothing special. The good part of that meal were the kettle chips, really! They were awesome.\nWe enjoyed our pretzels very much.\nWe didn't stay for dessert, we've had problems with three of their desserts in the past and we weren't going to try them again.\nService and wait staff were slow and uninterested, it's July and it must suck to work there with it mostly empty, I know servers make crap, so I left a fair tip, but I'm done. \n\nIn this economic climate, either get good at what you do or go away. There are better places to eat. Tons of them.
1 ||| I've tried food from here three more times, it keeps getting worse.\nThe quality just keeps sinking.\n\nMost of the food tastes like reheated frozen food.\nActually, I've had better frozen italian from the grocery store.\n\nBig portions of ill tasting food, and not cheap either.
4 ||| My favorite place :)
0 ||| I am the co-organizer of a Meetup.com group comprised of African women. My group organizer and me found a website listing 2013 dates for free wine tasting. I called the bar to confirm the days of the week and time for wine tasting about two months before the event was posted. The day of the event, I called as instructed before with the total number of attendees. There were fifteen in our group that day. Soon after arrival,  I asked the waitress when the wine tasting going to start. The waitress told me the days of the wine tasting were held during the week. Of course, a wine tasting was not schedule for the day the Group visited the My Wine Cellar.\n\nThe owner, an Asian woman came over and shared with me and members of the group, \"...You should have called... did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website.....?\" This was the extent of the owner's response until I found the website with the information about the wine tasting on my smart phone. The owner looked at the website. I pointed out the information on this site was more recent in publication than The Wine Cellar website. She responded again with the same statements as before and walked away. The feedback from the group was consistent. Members of the group as well as myself were irritated at the owner indifference. \n\nThe owner was aware of the information out there about her company language used... thus response, \"Did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website.....?\". The waitress was very helpful and apologized, the owner did not. The owner put the blame on me... \"You should have called. I have been an organizer of a Meetup group and I called before...\" I did.\nA member of the group went to the owner to share her dismay at the indifference. One of the owners replies from the conversation included, \"So tell me... what do you want for free...\" Yup! Nice! The owner sent over a bucket of wine with no glasses. We ended up using water glasses that were left at the table from when we were first seated. \n\nWe were there for two hours making the best the situation. The average bill ranged from $15 to $60. The group will not come back to The Wine bar. This review will be posted everywhere it can be posted. By the way the food was okay and the drinks prices average.
2 ||| They a pretty good. My sister, wife, and I have been eating here more frequently. Passion bread and sauce is free during lunch and dinner an it's pretty good. It use to be amazing though. Pretty much all their food is at or above average. I generally get their Greek salad which is always really good. Service has slacked off in the last couple years, but at worst It has never been 'bad' service.
1 ||| I enjoyed the outdoor seating, but no real food inside for a light eat. But can't complain about the drink prices. Saw a few dead bugs not really my taste.
1 ||| I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow. The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life. Or maybe just feel like it. \n\nI prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait.
4 ||| If you know what a real bagel is... then you will understand that this is where you can get a real bagel! Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even. not to mention a great basic egg bagel. Then you have enormous sized sandwiches. And red potato salad to die for. The fruit salad is also amazing fresh cut on site fruit- not your typical nasty slimy fruit salad. Great food. Best bagels. Good atmosphere and in a great location.\nI took my Manhattanite-turned-Socal girl friend here and she was SO EXCITED to have a real NYC bagel. enough said!
4 ||| This place is the place to go for when you plan to throw a BIG MEXICAN/LATIN FIESTA!!! Si, si, si!!!!! :) \n:) They are awesome, It reminds me of Mexico and its Open-aired local markets. Great prices, freshly made corn Tortillas and its also the perfect place to request freshly grounded masa. Thats if you know how to make Tameles from scratch.\n I have never dined there, but food looks good!!  I LOVE THE AGUAS FRESCAS!!! OH SOO AMAZING Horchata, Fresa, Sandia and Papaya water!!!! :) YUM, YUM!!!\nGreat service, big smiles everywhere and a large variety of products and produce!!
3 ||| We waited quite awhile to be waited on. Finally waitress came and apologized and offered comp drinks. Food was really good. Had pulled pork sandwich. My husband the wranglers burger. Coconut cream pie did not taste as good as when Penny made them. Not as much filling. More whip topping. Oh well
3 ||| Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.
0 ||| what an awful experience.\n\nwe're getting married (yay!) in October and have started the search for my wedding dress. my mom and friends flew in from out of town and i also had a few close friends from phoenix come out for a day of fun, trying on dresses, and girl stuff. the plan was to have an awesome day and hopefully find the dream dress.\n\nwe had all just come from a wonderful experience at uptown bridal in downtown chandler (girls, i highly recommend hitting this place up!). now, i knew that david's bridal was more of a national chain and that it was a busy place, full of dresses and people and that i probably wasn't going to get the personalized attention that i had gotten at the previous salon. fully understood this. but i wasn't prepared for the complete lack of caring by the david's bridal associate, the cramped dressing room, and the little to no help of getting into the gowns that were being pushed on me by the associate. it sucked.\n\nthe location itself is fine, however, the store inside is dirty and the dressing rooms/carpets are kind of gross. not a huge fan. the dressing rooms are also extremely small. its hard to be in there with three other dresses and attempting to get into a fourth. its a small miracle i didn't fall out of the room half naked while stuck in some fluffy gown from hell. the associate started off ok but i could tell it had been a busy day for her. i didn't want to be an annoyance so i asked her to pull up my favorites from the david's bridal website and go from there. she immediately crossed half of the dresses because they weren't available at that store (thanks for telling me in advance) and then went off to collect the remaining dresses. we waited for another 15 minutes before she came back with two dresses.... one of which was not on my favorites. \n\nat uptown bridal i had been given a slip which covered my body and definitely helped with the shyness factor. here at db she threw a corset at me and told me to get into the dresses and then open the door so she could zip me up. what the hell? most of these dresses weigh a ton and have so much tulle in the bottom you get lost! it was really hard getting into these things, but also given the size of the dressing room, i'm not sure how she would have helped all that much without having to have the door open. \n\ni tried on dress after dress that she brought which were not on my favorites :/. my friend had to step in and insist that she actually bring some from the list. also the associate disappeared for lengthy periods of time leaving me waiting in the dressing room helpless. i finally had my other friend come in and help me otherwise we would have been there for hours. the associate kept trying to push dresses on me that were not at all aligned with what i had told her my style/preference was. it just became a depressing, hot, and really draining effort to be at this location with an associate that really didnt care at all.\n\ni will never ever recommend going to this david's bridal location to anyone. it was awful and i cannot see spending my money at this particular store.
2 ||| Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies.  As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente.  Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection.  If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go.
2 ||| Nice view.... Nobody here.... And service is not that great. Have to wait for drinks.  Food service slow as well. VERY average.
1 ||| Sadly this place is only serving up two good things. Catfish and yams.\n\nTheir greenbeans were bland.\nOkra tasted old and dried out. \nFried Chicken was standard.\nGreens were good buy missing some seasoning. \nThe cornbread was a big ol square mound of possibly uncooked sweet cornmeal.\n\nNot interested in going back.
0 ||| I used to get my toes done at Foxy Nails a few years ago and always found it clean and satisfactory but the facility has become rundown and the staff is rude and racist. When another client wanted to know how long she'd have to wait to have her eyebrows done, the techs made fun of her behind her back (ladies, the \"N\" word in your native tongue sounds a lot like the \"N\" word in English, have some class). I will definitely not be going back. The service was OK but I drove past easily a half dozen better nail places and will go there instead.
1 ||| I am a Thailand return Peace Corps volunteer, which, for better or worse, has made me a Thai food snob. I came here after reading reviews about the authenticity of the food. We had the Tom yum, which was watered down and tasted simply like chicken broth, som tum (papaya salad) that was neither spicy, nor sweet, nor sour, and larb (minced chicken) that was equally tasteless. The owner was out telling (yelling) stories, which was amusing at first, but he could use some coaching of when enough is enough. I wouldn't recommend coming here.
2 ||| Good beer, Wednesday night is banjo night which always draws a crowd. Definitely a hipster bar. Food is fresh & worth trying. Get a dish that includes the house humus.
4 ||| My vegetarian boyfriend and I love Pizza Heaven's vegan sausage. He thought I had made a mistake when ordering, but I assured him that I hadn't - it really was vegan sausage. The sauce was flavorful and the crust perfectly baked. The dough ball dessert was terrible (can't remember what it was called), so pass on that. But, the pizza was the best we've ever had.
1 ||| It's a slow, but steady slide... \n\nTrying to count the total number of times I've been into the Harmony is futile; Yelp shows I have 16 check-ins, but I'd venture a guess that I check-in maybe once for every 2-3 visits.\n\nInteracting with the bartenders, one would think each of my visits was my first. They don't seem to recall regulars, or if they do, they don't seem to care much. Not looking for any special treatment, but when I walk-in, sit down and say, \"Hi, how's it going?\" I'd hope for a bit of a reply other than a grunt or a \"I'm so busy I couldn't possibly bother with a response\" eye roll.\n\nFood is continuing to slide; had a cheeseburger with fried onions last night... the dry bun overwhelmed the small, overcooked burger. A mound of fried onions delivered almost no extra flavor. Removed the bun and ate the burger solo.\n\nLake Louie Arena Premium is usually a fave of mine, but the one I had on Saturday (a few days earlier) tasted off - like the tap line was in need of a good cleaning.\n\nI also wasn't allowed to start a tab; it was pay-as-I-go... so, when I ordered food and a beer, I had to pay (and tip). Need a refill? Pay again. Ugh.\n\nThere are so many great places in the area; I'll be visiting the other haunts. So sad.\n\nPub chips, though... yum.
4 ||| This is my top choice for replacing my car battery.\n\nI bought a battery from an Autozone in Chandler a couple years ago. I visited here in Gilbert when I began to have battery problems. I was a little perplexed because it didn't seem that my battery should be dying so soon. And I didn't have a receipt or anything to prove it.\n\nGood news!  Autozone had my account in their system and a record of when I bought the battery. Yay! (Doing the happy dance.) The records said the battery had a few months before it was set to expire.\n\nSince it was still under warranty, I got a new 2-year battery for free! They installed it for me and everything. PLUS, they will discount my next battery purchase because the previous one was defective. Yelp, you heard it right!\n\nSo Cool. So Awesome. What was especially sweet is that I didn't have to ask for all this. I didn't have to whine or throw a tantrum or demand to see a manager (All actions I wouldn't have taken anyway, but you know what I'm sayin...).\n\nI have to say, I think I trust Autozone. I am hesitant to say this because I was taught NOT to trust mechanics. So we'll see. But as far as batteries go, they seem to be the real deal. \n\nLike I said, this is my top choice for replacing my car battery.
0 ||| Was there 3 months ago and had horrible service. It took forever to get our food then when it finally came it was not only wrong but cold. The manager apologized and comped most of the meal. We went back tonight and had another bad experience. We got our drinks and appetizer without a problem but then sat for over 30 mins waiting for our food. The waitress came over and said they had been having kitchen trouble all day but it would be out in 2 mins. 3 mins later she sits down at another customers table chatting with them. Another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming. I told her it had been over 30 mins and the waitress told us 2 mins 3mins ago. She assured me it was coming and another few mins went by before our food came. Everything was cold. The fries seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and the cheeseburgers were stone cold. I had my 2 and 4 year old children with me who were out of patience and hungry. I told the waitress after waiting that long and then getting cold food we were leaving and not paying. She rolled her eyes at me. The waitress was Francis. I am disappointed and we will not be returning.
1 ||| Unbelievable! I received a phone call from the office manager of Heavenly Smiles Dental 13 days later, apparently to further insult me by stating that the office was waiting for information from me. When I went on to explain what happened and that I had canceled my appointment, he stated that he did not see that I existed in their files or in the city of Henderson for that matter. I was confused by his comment since the front office had managed to pull my file up 2 weeks prior. The information given to me was so convoluted I called my insurance company to make sure a claim was not being presented for services not rendered. The phone call solidified my decision to go elsewhere.
0 ||| The worst place to rent a car from !! They have no cars . Must wait almost 2 hours for a car and they don't care ! Stay away
1 ||| This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\n\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.
4 ||| I ordered pork fried rice. That's it and it was AMAZING!!! My girlfriend ordered the veggie fried rice and loved it also!!! The fried rice did not disappoint. Not one bit. I will be back to grab more of this delicious rice soon!!!
1 ||| After getting my first dog from the pound (Mr. Watson, the monocle-wearing schnauzer miz) I had a voucher for a free vet visit on the City as part of the deal. This place is right in the middle of my hood, so naturally we took the wee pup here for his first visit. \n\nWe called ahead of time to make an appointment and clarify that the voucher was good for one free visit and were given the all clear. So thermometers were inserted in very awkward places and our little pup was weighed, measured, and found to be totally awesome. End of vet visit we're presented with a bill for 40 some odd bucks.\n\nAfter some pretty heavy complaining that, \"WTF, mate? That's not what you said on the phone,\" they waived the initial visitation fee and let us go on our merry way. I've cross checked the prices here with other vets to get the little booger vaccinated and sure enough, they charged for the vet visit in addition to the vaccination fees. \n\nGo to Blue Cross Animal Clinic down the street and they'll charge you the flat fee for the vaccine, no office visit or nothin'. Sure beats the crappy clinic at Petsmart too, where they charge the same straight fee for the vaccines and waive the vet visit. \n\nI do like that I'm still on their mailing list though, and get my yearly check-up reminder for my little pupperoni.
4 ||| This was my third time eating here and by far the best. Everything was perfectly prepared but the best of all was our waiter Sal. He was perfectly attentive without being invasive and made the evening the best ever! Thanks Sal
4 ||| I am only 5 feet tall with short arms and short waisted, so nearly everything needs to be altered. I consider it a blessing to have discovered Christies more than 10 years ago. Christie is so sweet, always welcoming, and really listens to what you want. She guarantees that you'll be happy with the alteration, or her team will re-do the item. Turn around time is quick and pricing is very reasonable for the quality and attention to detail. I live in SC and wouldn't go anywhere else.
4 ||| Dan was awesome! I use my phone for business and Verizon reccomended him because they couldn't help me. I was in a panic all morning because my phone wouldn't charge. I went to Sun Cellular and within 45 minutes my phone was fixed and back in business. Saved me! Thank you a ton!!!! Very affordable to was pretty shocked how cheap it was.
0 ||| Delta Mechanical has got to be the most umproffessional company I have ever dealt with.  I'm shocked that Home Depot would refer them out!  I went to home depot to buy a gas stove and needed a gas line ran to the kitchen from the garage which is also right next to the gas meter.  (about 10 feet away) I was told that they couldn't give me an exact price over the phone but it would range from $300 up to $600.  After them cancelling on me twice because \"the truck broke down\" They called me back to let me know it would be $1700 so I quickly cancelled and will have another company do the install.  Shame on Home Depot!! I will definitely let Home Depot know about this as well.
4 ||| Good burgers at an amazing price. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had an awesome cheeseburger and mushrooms--which was huge and just homemade grilled burgers --fries and a shake, needless to say we couldn't finish it all! To top it off, the staff were all genuinely friendly and helpful.\n\nWe will definitely be visiting again!
2 ||| If it wasn't for the newly renovated room, I would've given this particular hotel a lesser rating. Unfortunately, there were some highlights of the trip like the awesomely priced buffet and the newly renovated rooms, but at the same time there were certain aspects of my stay that I wish I was aware of beforehand. For example, I wish I was informed that there wasn't an in-room fridge to put my drinks in (warm water in a Vegas summer is no good) or the the pool's size.\n\nOtherwise, the hotel wasn't an absolute bust. The staff at the front desk as well as those cleaning the room were really friendly and that's always something I expect from a hotel and they did not disappoint in customer service.
0 ||| I opened the door and was greeted by the f-word.  I guess it was the owner (waxed mustache) was going on about some story of his band.  Every sentence had a f and or s-bomb spoken quite loudly.   The guy would have been obnoxious and offensive in a bar at closing time.  At noon on Sunday it was inexcusable.  I won't be going in again.
4 ||| AMAZING! im obsessed.... we have gone the past two days because it is just so magical. Love snow cones and their ice is soo finely shaved. an immense amount of flavors to choose from and also smoothies, coffee, ice cream.  Bonus though, you can order 60 snowballs for 12 bucks! How cool is that? they put them in a cooler and you are good to go for a snowball fight! We are having one tonight i will have to let you know how it goes. This place is definitely worth experiencing especially in this AZ weather
0 ||| $79 for 10 shirts and a suit! WOW that's what I get for trying to support my local business!  RIP OFF ALERT!
3 ||| Excellent independent coffee shop.  Hometown feel with NoDa culture.  Staff is friendly and the locals are interesting.  Good place to relax or have laid back business meeting.  Free Wifi and rocking chairs don't hurt either.
2 ||| Nice, relaxing atmosphere. Food was well presented and good.
0 ||| Well it was a beautiful Sunday...until we went here for food..big mistake...We are new to Phoneix just been here 3 weeks..And we were were hoping as it was owned by Bob Evans..it would be similar to the home cooking we were use to coming from MIchigan...So very wrong...first off greeted by BonJour!! really...we should have walked right then...Dennys would have been better..To late for Eggs B that i had been craving so settled for the egg white frattata..omg horrible..undercooked not flavor and turkey sausages really can you cook them...My partner had the roasted chicken crepes...omg what is that sauce....and the so called balsamic dressed greeens...so sweet it made your teeth hurt....it was horrible and we will never be gong back...and we will tell our friends dont go there ever....there should be a ZERO star..Yelp needs to have a lower scale.....and we wish we would have check Yelp before going...wont make that mistake again....
3 ||| I eat here whenever I'm in Madtown, and it rocks my world every time.  It's true that the decor makes it look like a weird Greek fast food joint, and there are always groups of rowdy UW kids scarfing some spanakopitas, but this place is a Madison institution for a reason.  The gyros are awesome and the fries are great - especially when dipped in the tzatziki sauce.  Don't be a snob about it, just have a few spotted cows and dig in.
2 ||| My friend Mario likes to meet here for breakfast, because we can just sit and talk.  I've been here twice, both on a Saturday morning around 8:30am.  The wait staff is friendly.\n\nThe breakfast is OK.  My wife keeps asking me to take her here, and one of these days, I'm gonna do it.\n\nOn my last visit, I ordered me some blueberry pancakes.  They were very large and I couldn't finish.  I thought I caught Mario staring longingly at the leftovers on my plate, until I realized he was just being transported back in time as he told a story of his childhood.\n\nThe food is plausible, but I'm partial to the atmosphere.  Que Dios Te Bendiga.
4 ||| My boo and I decided to tie the knot in Vegas and chose A Little White Wedding Chapel. I'm happy to say everything went off perfectly.  Our limo driver showed up on time and was very friendly. Everybody inside the chapel was great. The photographer did a great job and even took a few extra pictures for us that weren't included in our package. We loved our minister. Even though we had only just met it seemed like he really knew us. I thought he did a wonderful job and my boo was very pleased. After our ceremony the staff even found an extra limo for us to help shuttle our guests back to our hotel. Sure it's cheesy, but it's Vegas! That's the point!\n\nYes, you will have to tip people (you would if you got married at a church in your home town too). I think at the end of the day I tipped out somewhere around $180 outside of the package. Guess what, it's Vegas people! You tip people here. Plus you can win or lose twice that much money in a couple minutes at the tables. Don't listen to the complainers and be prepared with some extra dough and you will be fine.\n\nA Little White Wedding Chapel helped make our wedding a special day. We are very glad we got married here.
1 ||| From the outside, Phu Thanh looks different from any other Vietnamese restaurant in town. It's larger, has a huge presence outside of the typical hidden strip mall, and looks promising. \n\nRest assured, Phu Thanh is different from most Vietnamese restaurants on the east side... it's very very bad. During a one-hour dinner in their dining room, I noticed three tables that were covered in dirty dishes upon my arrival, and still covered in the same dirty dishes upon my departure. Not to say this ruined my experience, but it sure was disgusting to look at. The waiter service here was actually nicer and more helpful than most, a which is the saving grace here. They offered a refill of my water (rare) and even came back to see if I needed anything else (very rare.) The clientele here seemed like predominately young married couples and young families of non-asian descent. \n\nI had been craving a bowl of Bun all day, a rice noodle dish served with julienned veggies, your choice of meat, and a nuoc mam (fish sauce) to give it a nice flavor. I also ordered spring rolls  prior to my meal, and was a tad surprised when, having ordered in Vietnamese, the server asked me questions that made no sense. My order of Goi Cuon garnered a respose of \"fried or not fried\" which definitely threw me off since fried would be Gha Gio, an entirely different dish... did you ask this because I'm white? He then asked \"you need fork right?\" No, I just gave you my entire order and said hello in conversational Vietnamese... this wasn't a tip off that I know how to eat your food? The spring rolls were very small and contained little filling. I'm used to Goi Cuon bursting with veggies pork and shrimp, not little tiny thunb sized things. When the Bun came, the noodles were all broken, which made it almost impossible to eat in anything other than tiny bites. The Nuoc Mam had an overwhelming fish sauce smell and flavor and was easily the worst I've ever had, and completely lacked chili, garlic, or anything to mask the fish sauce. Utterly awful. I also felt like the Bun portion was incredibly small compared to other Viet restaurants in town.\n\nI would hesitate to give this place any sort of recommendation, given it's proximity to some of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town. The quality seemed to be on par, and service was somewhat decent, but the combination of small portions, bad tasting food, and lack of ability to clean a table earns this restaurant a solid two-star review. Also, eating Vietnamese more than three times a week, I've had a good run of over two years and haven't become sick from a place. This one has had me burping for the past 12 hours and feeling kind of queasy... nothing major, but definitely something didn't sit well. I'm honstly not sure what the appeal of this restaurant is. Two miles away is Pho Ao Sen, one of the premier spots in the valley.
2 ||| Nikkos is always a solid choice for sushi, but I am a more adventurous person when it comes to sushi rolls. They have great salmon sashimi, however it is 6$ for two pieces so it can get pricey really quickly. The place has decent service, but except a wait on Friday/Saturdays. They also have a DJ Friday and Saturday nights as well as free valet service so you don't have to try to navigate the parking garage.
4 ||| Great as usual.  A bit loud but we love the pancakes and the family friendly place.
4 ||| Guy's haircuts can be a gamble at chain haircut places... you want a certain style and you end up walking out with some Edward Scissor-Hands creation from someone who has probably only ever had to cut 2 inches off of long strands of women's hair or a chia pet. Maybe they've even shaved a dog before, but they've definitely never done a guy's haircut that involved anything but a \"number 3\". So far I've had a couple of great cuts from two different ladies here who really know how to deliver on how a guy's haircut should look. Honestly the one I recently had is probably the best haircut I have ever had and this is after going to a place for 6 months that charged me $60 each time after I had 2 consecutive what I would call \"prison cuts\" at a Great Clips. This last cut blew away any \"high end\" place I've been too at a fraction of the price. I haven't directly received permission from the owner to post names, but there is some great talent here!
1 ||| I am an OB card member.  We signed up for our memberships at Legacy.  I played the course in the summer and despite the heat the course was in good shape.  We played again today and the majority of the course was in good shape but there were several greens that had dead spots (no grass) and it looked as if they tried to cover up the spots with green chemicals of some sort.  Some of the cart paths had concrete that was broken in spots.  I guess for $49 I just expected the course to be in better shape and expected a little more of a top tier experience.  Now lets get to the worst part.  I decided to eat in the clubhouse after the round.  Bad idea.  Worst burger and bun I have ever had and I still have an upset stomach hours later.  I understand that golf courses really exist for one purpose but I feel like if you are going to have a restaurant and offer food that you should try to serve decent food.  So for the value the course was not very good and the restaurant was horrible.  We won't be back anytime soon and we certainly will not eat in the restaurant again.
3 ||| Trader Joe's is great. I love this one because the staff is REALLY friendly, and it never gets unbearably crowded. I've encountered a few situations where items which are regularly stocked staples were sold out, but all-in-all I've had numerous positive experiences here.  One thing to keep in mind with any perishable products from Trader Joe's, is that since most of it is very natural food without extra preservatives, etc, is that it tends to expire quickly.. Be sure to check expiration dates before buying an item, and eat em up fast! :)
3 ||| Okay, this is a local's secret. Tucked away off the beaten track. It's not pretty from the outside. The inside is okay! It was recently remodeled so it is much better then it used to be. People flock here because the food is great! The service is pretty good as well. The staff is running when it's busy, which is pretty much all day everyday. The prices are good and considering the quality of the food, I'd say really a great deal! You may have trouble finding it, but once you've been I'm sure you will return!
4 ||| You go to someone like Dave because he specializes in British & Related higher caliber vehicles. Why...? You don't have to worry about them cross threading oil plugs or other BS that happens on the cheap-o places. I've come to Dave a few times on strategic repairs on my Land Rover (repairs that only fix what is needed) so the car keeps rolling. Dave and his crew understand this and don't try BS up-selling. If one wants to be a low-budget player and drive a British car then one is dreaming. Try a Toyota, beep-beep.  -- bottom line -- Dave and his team get the job done and at a fair-market price for the caliber of car. Try going to the dealer and you will pay much more.  \n\nWhatever to the whining about a $70. oil change. Head back to Jiffy Lube, sounds like you already going there Korina, or get a corolla.  \n\n** update 6/27/11, Dave and his team got my car in and out in under an hour. I passed emission after some minor adjustments. DAVE AND HIS TEAM DELIVER!!
1 ||| Went thru the drive-thru with my wife and daughter. Had to repeat back every item that we ordered. I guess they were done taking my order because they gave me my total before I was done telling them what I wanted. Oh well. Then got my drink wrong even after I had to repeat it 3x. I'm not even gonna go thru my disappointment with the ketchup.
0 ||| Very misleading, advertising $49.00 and then changed the price.  The staff wasn't accomadating, the place was dirty and no security that we saw.  Our patio door (on second floor) was unlocked when we arrived. This place is worse than a Motel 6 with the price of a 139.00, so I wouldn't say it was affordable to the average person.  There was no clock, no blow dryer, no TV remote for either TV, no iron but an ironing board (they said people steal them) but for 140.00 they could buy more?  You could throw a cat out around the door.  This was a suite? but where a sofa should have been they had put in 2 double beds and as a result you tripped over the bed everytime you went from room to room.  The bedskirt was way to big for the bed under which I found the attachment for a inflatable mattress and other paper.  The bath towel made a good loofa!  The blankets were really thin.  Never again!!  Our Tom Tom said it was a Comfort Inn but obviously not any more.  The WiFi was spotty.  I found the front staff not that helpful.  If we had known what it was, we wouldn't have stayed... but it was 11:30 and we were tired.  AVOID IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO IT, There is a whole bunch of other hotels just down the street.
2 ||| I have been going to gyms for a long time.. but i rarely like them.  I do like 24hr. They have everything I want for the most part.  I like it more because I know when to go so it is not crowded.\n\nThey have fair pricing, and no contract and I can go to anyone in the valley which works because I am all over the valley often. So I think it is pretty good.  The staff is cool too.  \n\nI don't like the fact that they don't have a punching bag.  Sometimes I just want to beat on the bag and you can't do that with the ones I have been to.  The TV's need to be upgraded also.\n\nBut overall it is a good experience.
0 ||| My buddy raved about this place and how authentic it was.  So I joined him for lunch.  If a rock hard tamale is your idea of authentic then this is the place for you.  $1 beer if you order lunch.
3 ||| This place is a family favorite. I won't say that they have the best quality food but it's good enough for me. And I've never understood why some people expect anything fresh and healthy from a fast food place. \"Fast food\" and \"healthy\" are on opposite sides of the spectrum! I am a big believer in the saying \"you get what you pay for.\" \n\nMy go-to meal here is the 7 piece shrimp and chips and a monster burger plain with cheese. Yummy. \n\nPete's does need to get with the times. They only take cash. It's a bit funny to see Pete's n00bs asking if they can use their cards. If you need cash, you can go next door to the Circle K and get some. They have a $40 cash back limit, if I am not mistaken. \n\nYou will likely have to do some bum dodging. They mostly hang around the Circle K area but sometimes wander over to Pete's. \n\nIronically, I've been eating here since I was a kid but I have never tried the fish. Not a fish person at all! \n\nOther than the bums and the no debit/credit, the only other complaint I have is that they did not put enough ice in my rasberry ice tea on my last visit.\n\nBon App\u00e9tit !
1 ||| I like Dr. Desantos. He seems nice and caring. I cannot stand office staff. They seen arrogant and occasionally rude. There is always really long wait time. It is infuriating, considering that they Require you to come in 15min before appointment time. I was refused to be seen ( by office staff, not MD) because I was there 10min prior appointment (not 30 as they required for 1st appt. It was not justified medically, girl on the phone did not verify Why I have made an appointment, could have had an emergency)\nLooking for another obgyn now.
0 ||| Only come here if your really hungry and out of options. Took over ten minutes to get my food and sent back the fries as they were room temp. Should have sent back the burger too but I was hungry at this point. Counted  five people behind the counter and two people in front of me. Horrible.
1 ||| My friend and I came here for a quick bite after a movie and found the service to be flat and the food very average.  \n\nI hadn't been in an Arby's for a few years, but thought we would give them a try since Wendy's bought them a while ago.  UGH!  \n\nI guess it will be a few more years before I come back.  Sorry, guys!
3 ||| Love it, had it today the chicken tortilla soup in a bread bowl was amazing, plus the people were so nice and pleasant. Defiantly loved this location too!
2 ||| Don't ask me why but I keep singing Maria Maria with Bonterra in place of the Marias ...weird I know, but I've been doing it ever since we planned to go for Restaurant Week. Anyhoo - My experience started when I pulled in the parking lot. The way they positioned the sign it appeared that half was reserved for valet- wrong. All of it was reserved for valet (I was told not to park there and rarely carry cash) so I turned around and parked in the lot down the street. My friend had the same issue so perhaps they should move their sign. \n\nWe received some bread with oil so no delicious herb butter as others mentioned. The bread was not warm nor particularly flavorful so it was just ok nothing special. I ordered the filet but asked if I could swap out the sweet potatoes for literally anything else as I honestly cannot stand sweet potatoes in any form but fries. He just said NO - the chef was strict about that which I suppose is understandable (to be fair no substitutions was written on the menu) but at least offer to ask or heck even pretend to ask. I then just asked if I could have my sweet potato on the side instead in order to avoid that maple mess from touching my beloved steak or broccoli rabe/raab (not said in those exact words mind you!)  \n\nI get my steak and  it is served upon the mashed sweet potato and under that was the broccoli. I transferred the steak immediately to my small plate and asked if I could get some fresh broccoli on the side. He said \" oh they shouldn't have done that\" and thought yea they shouldn't have but you're the one who brought it out and served it to me and it is bright orange. Anyway, after speaking up I was happy because I received even more broccoli than previously however I had to eat off my side plate for the duration of the meal. I will say the steak was cooked perfectly (rare girl here) and seasoned nicely with salt and pepper. I tried a bite of short-rib which was spectacular but it was paired with way over cooked gnocchi. \n\nOther dishes I ordered were the pappardelle with rabbit. Quite tasty, although I would have liked a richer sauce. I tried my friends feta croquettes which were good and I also liked the frisee salad (awesome dressing). Another friend ordered the soup which had way under done chick-pea's in it and was not very good.  The desserts we had were good. The consensus at the table was that the praline cheesecake took the prize. The chocolate molten cake was good however the green tea ice cream was my favorite but melted extremely quickly because it was scooped with a melon ball (yes really) and the plate was warm. I initially wanted the rhubarb trifle but it mysteriously was not on the menu nor was it mentioned ....bummer. \n\nThe venue itself is very nice- an old restored church. I will say my napkin was ripped to shreds , not what you expect when it's suppose to be fine dining. The napkin was also white and I wore black, but I didn't fault them too much because that's nitpicky. The big issue was that the service was downright cold and distant. I realize it is restaurant week but we had a late reservation and the place was not overly busy, I think our server could have done a much better job.
0 ||| Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  Will not go back.
1 ||| I went to this place just moving here from NC, I went up to the barber and said how you doing today my name is martin. the guy looked at me like I was on drugs. didn't say hi or talked at all. very rude, they give good haircuts but the barbers are rude.
4 ||| I'm surprised at the number of bad reviews this location has!\n\nI've been to this same location for years and years as I live .1 mile away.\n\nI love to get the Blackberry Sweet Tea...\n\nI go early in the morning on my way to work and order the spicy jumbo popcorn chicken. I'm glad they serve lunch at 6 am because I hate all things breakfast.\n\nI bring my doggies there and they give them milkbones! How thoughtful...\n\nAnyways, the shakes are great too! There's real fruit in them!\n\nSonic is an awesome place in general.... With happy hour and all.\n\n5 stars.
3 ||| Ok yes, it is a little shady. But hot damn is it my guilty pleasure. \n\nIf you want that traditional American-Chinese food that we have all had since we were kids go here. Drinks are totally from 1950's. Love it.
3 ||| not your average Irish pub... on the weekends it can get packed... and upstars they have a DJ or band and it can get a lil crazy... on big nights it is hard to move beacuse of so many pople but i guess it is like that everywhere in CLT... i have never eaten there food... but have heard it is ok...
1 ||| The lack of customer service I have experienced here time and time again is the sole reason I either buy from their website or from Sephora. \n\nI've been to this Ulta at least half a dozen times and have never once had an employee come up and ask if I needed help with finding something. The employees you do find around are either busy chit chatting with each other, on their cellphones texting or seem annoyed that you're asking for the location of a specific item. After this last trip there I will not be going back which is a damn shame because they generally have a good stock on hand (which is why they get 2 stars vs 1).
0 ||| Been to many thai places, service at this one is rude and slow, more expensive then most other places and small portions, forget it, dont easte your money!
0 ||| wow..where to begin...I guess it's really my fault for thinking a chain could do shrimp and grits but the photo looked so good...sucker. When the food finally arrived it was in a cast iron pan and was luke warm..the biscuit was a hockey puck, the shrimp was\nsuper gritty...gross.The grits had a weird texture, more like over processed polenta. I thought I could just eat the grits on the second round, they were hot but terrible, I tried hot sauce...that didn't work, it was suppose to have sausage which was exactly 2 small pieces that I had to look for and tasted like processed hot dog. So I paid for the service, left hungry and went somewhere else...how sad never again Joe.
2 ||| The tanning they offer is good and the place looks nice. We just found their staff to be a bit rude and I don't spend money at places where employees act that way. Not likely to visit here again.
2 ||| We love Dean and Deluca and head there often, especially the one in the Philips Place area. I tell you, everything there is so convenient, and there's everything: nice dining, cheap dining, movies, shopping. But I digress. \n\nDean and Deluca, too, is great for everything: gourmet shopping, prepared food, or a nice snack. My girlfriend always complains that it's too pricy, and she's kinda right: a small container of potato salad was like $10. But it's soooo good, and so hard to turn down. \n\nI love their grilled chickens and their various salads: the salad bar is amazing, as are their tuna salads, eggs salads, pasta salads. If you're a lover of all types of salad, this place is perfect for you. It's your heaven. \n\nThis D and D is huge, so you can really stock up on every nice thing you need to fill a pantry or fridge (if you've got the bucks). Great coffees, too. It's the best, really. I go back too much.
0 ||| one word...GROSS!! We tried this buffet as it was highly recommended by a friend in Hawaii. I was not impressed at all. The food was displayed in a very unappetizing manner, and things seemed unsanitary. The food wasn't great either. You are better off at Panda Express. I left there feeling sick like I just had a meal in China. The workers don't all speak english, I asked someone what something was as not all the food was labeled. He looked at me and didn't utter a word and just shrugged his shoulders. Not good if you have food allergies, don't expect them to help you.
1 ||| Friendly staff, decent food. However it takes forever for them to make your food and the restaurant itself looks a bit trashy.
0 ||| I keep trying to give this place second chances but it never works out. I always end up disappointed by the overpriced meals and the terrible service.
0 ||| Scratch this one off the list.  It was horrible.\n\nWe were enticed with a Travel Zoo coupon.  But it was not even worth 1/2 price.\n\nIt is a neighborhood Italian restaurant with no personality or charm.  Prices were definitely high for the ambiance and quality.  My fish was so \"fishy\" I couldn't eat it.  My wife had the eggplant and it was oily.   The bread was burned and dry.  Desserts at $9 was terrible.  They supposedly make their own Teramisu, so we tried it.  It was mostly fake whipped cream and the inside tasteless and soggy.\n\nThere are much better Italian restaurants in the area and more moderately priced.\n\nThe service was not up to par.  We got the wrong dish.  The waitress seemed like she really didn't care that we were there.\n\nI doubt this place will make it much longer.  It was no more than a third full on a Saturday night.\n\nTrust me on this and STAY AWAY.  It was one of the worst meals I've had in a long long time.  I'd rather go to a cafeteria.
0 ||| I got sick eating this food.. DONT EAT HERE.. my wifes co workers had the same experience
0 ||| Possibly the worst service I've ever had in Madison.  A hostess once tried to take away the table we'd just been seated at because some friend of hers wandered by and wanted to be seated immediately.  I've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff.\n\nThe food is nothing special--not BAD, but definitely overpriced.  The half-price margaritas, the only reason I ever go there, are pretty good, but they recently instituted a requirement that you purchase like $10 worth of their overpriced food in order to get a table rather than being confined to the bar.  Not worth it.
0 ||| THIS PLACE IS AWFUL! Took me about 5 min to get served after several employees walked right past the counter. When We got our food the fries had obliviously been sitting for a while because the fry hopper was full and we were the only ones there. Then they tried to tell me they were out of coffee and smoothies! They need to understand that the people coming in and buying food pay there checks every two weeks. The staff is terrible and the food is awful I will NOT be back
4 ||| I highly recommend Dr. Quackenbush and the staff. Everyone is caring and so good with kids!
1 ||| I decided to make this my first stop on my never-ending quest to find the perfect wedding dress.  I thought this would be a good place to start since it would have many different styles in a variety of price points. Unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience. \n\nFirst, when we walked in I got the same feeling I have anytime I go into Sears. The carpet was dirty, the dressing rooms were barren, and it smelled like feet.\n\nSecond, our consultant seemed to be clueless. I gave her a few ideas about what I was looking for (a-line, under $800, illusion neckline or sleeves). She really struggled finding anything that fit these requirements. After I tried on 3 dresses and wasn't impressed she asked \"Well, what do you want to do?\" Really? This is my first time trying on dresses. I'd like to try on a few more. \n\nOverall it was a very uninspiring trip. My hopes were probably too high, but I had expected some small degree of pampering. Instead it felt like I was inconveniencing the salesperson with my \"outrageous\" demands. Also, the selection of dresses wasn't as large as you would think. If you want an inexpensive strapless  gown I'm sure you could find something. If you want anything else you would do better elsewhere.
4 ||| They offer a menu from 11am - 3 pm with a large selection of dishes.\nWe ordered the Flounder in a pan fried style for $6.95, braised bean curd with yui choi $6.95, house special fried noodle $5.95 and string beans in xo sauce $6.95. I thought the dishes would be half sized orders but was surprised with full size portions. \nThe food is a hit in my books a great option to if you want to venture away from the strip.
3 ||| Cabo Fish Taco is super tasty... I've been there twice but this is my first review and both times was great! The downside.... if you're super hungry, go early or be prepared to wait. I've been to NoDa several times and this place is always crowded.... I'm talking 45 min wait or so.... But it's no big deal because they tell you your table is ready via text so we just went across the street to get a drink and an appetizer and problem solved. I wish they did take a few reservations for big parties.\n\nTheir food is very very good. The fish tacos are the signature dish and the best part is that you can mix and match the fillings. There's a ton of sides I've had the nopalito salad, the beans, the avocado salad and they are all very good. The beer battered shrimp/fish were my favorite. \nI also had a burrito on my other visit and it was also very good. We had queso and some sort of crab dip as an appetizer and they were both good. Their salsa has corn and its super yummy. \n\nThe service was good too.... prices are very reasonable and you get giant servings of food so can't complain.
3 ||| Here's the deal. I want to totally love this, but frankly, Phoenix is still missing the traditional diner, even when it's housed in an authentic diner. I was hoping this would be the epic college hang-out, but it's too expensive for that. An 8 buck burger is three dollars away from a night out for a collegiate. 5 bucks for a 12 oz plastic cup pour, even a good draft, is still not in that ballpark. Actually, it's close to ballpark pricing. Knock off at least a buck.  And 4 dollars for a very small portion of collard greens will not bring me back to eat it.\n\nI ordered the most expensive meal because I wanted the food experience. Their PB and B burger is exceptional, peanut butter with burger sounds weird, but it's damn tasty and good Schrieber's bacon(also used at Bill Johnsons Big Apple for less dinero). It's the highest price burger at $12.50. I also had the previously mentioned collard greens and a 7 buck Hurricane, tasty and well-mixed, almost at price point correctly with such good ingredients.\n\nThree items and with tip, over $28.00.  This falls into the realm of special event for me, and that's a shame as the folks running the kitchen, taking orders, owners are ALL great and the service was really casual yet efficient.\n\nI would love to see something like a whiskey and soda for $4.00, discounted pitchers of beer, maybe even a discount for bringing in your own coffee cup or dishes as there really is a lot of plastic waste coming out of there.\n\nSure, I'll be back, and for what it is(an amazing restoration of a wonderful place with a killer patio)I'm glad it's here. I'll have whatever is on special now, and skip the sides, though the fries with gravy could be killer with cheese curds a la  poutine. \n\nYet still I wait for the college hang-out.
2 ||| I want to start with a positive note. I love the Chef Alex Stratta. I will follow his food wherever he goes. With that said, the service was extremely disappointing. The waiter took forever to bring us bread & drinks at the beginning & basically ignored us most of the dinner. Other diners who were sat after us received their food before us because it took so long to take our order. For a restaurant of this caliber, this is unacceptable. The swordfish was a wee bit dry but good with the sauce. The salmon was good but one of my guests complained the steak had an herb he could not identify & left food on plate (he said it was all him & not the food). It was a ruined special occasion because of the service & the window almost crashing upon us.
1 ||| Nevada Dry Chicken Cafe was an extreme disappoint from the chicken to the side dishes. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with spinach feta cheese pasta and sweet potatoes as my sides. Both of them tasted like cafeteria food. I exchanged them for the BBQ beans and the coleslaw which were definitely better. I will not be back because a restaurant that is named the chicken cafe should know how to properly cook their chicken.
3 ||| I have been to this place many times now over the years. Surprised it has taken me so long to review it. Maybe, I thought I had.\nAnyway. Great location. It used to be more south. It was a cool little hole in the wall back then. Now it is more like a cool little family restaurant. \nThey play live music even on certain days.\nTHe food is good, the atmosphere is not too bad.It is a nice place to go and not too bad on the wallet.\nOn a busy day or night parking can be tight. But,  other wise it is great. Check it out one day when you are on the East side of pghoenix. You just might like it.
2 ||| If you told me Matt Groening based at least some of Comic Book Guy and his Android's Dungeon on Other Realm, I would totally believe you. I have had many friends tell me I am brave that I would shop there and that they went in once and would never go back. I totally understand this. The owner is kinda scary (take Comic Book Guy, add 10 years, gray hair, biker mentality, and crazy stories), and if you don't join in his crazy conversations, he kinda acts like he doesn't want you there.\n\nI will explain my 3 stars though. Other Realm gets one star for convenience (so close to campus that you can just walk there after class), one star for a very well stocked quarter bin FULL of great reads, and one star for an awesome Free Comic Book Day policy (instead of giving away the books every one else does, he stockpiles books that didn't sell too great during the year and you can take one of each).\n\nOverall, go to Other Realm if convenience is your biggest factor. If you have a car, go to G-Mart.
3 ||| Took my grandmother there for brunch while she was in town. It was a bit busy but overall the service was good. I had this pumpkin spice pancake with cinnamon apples on top that was out of this world!
3 ||| Of course I'm a fan, it's become a bit pricier since I first came so we'll keep an out eye for the others around the area, especially when they're really busy.\n\nGreat variety, quick service and can't go wrong after a long night/morning on the strip.
3 ||| Arribas is a locally owned and operated Mexican-American food restaurant; no illegals here, so stay away Sheriff Joe.\n\nSeriously, food is good, drinks are strong and reasonably priced, and usually they have a scary ass clown lady that will paint the mexican faces white, and the white faces Mexican! \n\nIt's a great place, and doesn't make me want to go all SB-1070. I thoroughly enjoy their enchiladas and burritos. It's a great place with a date or with a group. The staff is very diligent and polite and speak english as their first language.
2 ||| The food was really good. Very flavorful. We had asked for an order of Crab Angels (crab ragoon) but never received them. But all in all it was good food. Don't know if I would make a special trip or anything to go back. But if you are in the area and nothing else seems good, like KFC, Pizzahut, Tacobell this would be the better choice.
4 ||| I've been back here several times since my first review, and have been continually impressed with Prairie. The food is always spot on and the atmosphere is so comfortable. The cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old. All are served with a choice of side; I favor the black bean and corn salad. Breakfast is no exception to Prairie's perfection--my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling. And it's hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks. Prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be.
2 ||| I had the chili on Wednesday.. the green one.\n\nIt was as yummy as it looked!\n\nI had to give it one more star!
1 ||| okay so the veal was \"good\", but to advertise as good for kids and not have booster or high chairs is a stretch to say the least.
0 ||| I should've known by all the negative reviews not to use this place but since Mr. Rooter is well known throughout the United States I thought it would be okay. If there was a way to give - minus 5 stars  I definitely would.  I am an out-of-state condo owner that needed to have the water pressure in the kitchen faucet fixed. When the tech got out there he told me that I needed to have a new garbage disposal, a new kitchen faucet and to install two water shut off valves because there wasn't any. All this was going to cost me $1125. Yep! You read it correctly $1125. I told him that was outrageous  there's no way that even if I bought a new garbage disposal and a new kitchen faucet and two new water shut off valves that it would cost $1125. I could buy all that stuff from Home Depot for less than $200. He then asked me how much I thought the job was worth. I said maybe $200 -250 at most. He then said his boss said if I wanted to purchase the items they would install it for $300. Not to mention he used my tenants tools to look at what was wrong. I obviously refused the service and told him to leave the premise immediately. I called another company they arrived with-in an hour. They told me all that was wrong was the garbage disposal is clogged and the kitchen sink was clogged and there WERE shut off valves to the water. All that I needed to do was unclog both the sink and the garbage disposal and that would only cost me a service fee and $95. Clearly Mr. Rooter was trying to take advantage of a situation where I was an out-of-state condo owner and my tenant is not very handy. I would NEVER EVER recommend Mr. Rooter to anybody in Las Vegas. Please save your precious time do not use these people they are crooks.
2 ||| Pleasant little Irish-style place, with a patio and two stories and the usual Irish brews on tap.   But, as other reviewers have said, the lack of food means that the place should not claim to be a pub.
4 ||| Mexican food is funny because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. \n\nIf I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. \n\nService is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.
4 ||| I had my second class. It was nice. We practiced the templates in the book and our instructor showed us little techniques that really helped. \n\nThe small class environment and the other students in my class are friendly and nice.\n\nAt the end of the class, we used our new found knowledge to decorate our cakes we brought in.
1 ||| 1st off I was in between 1 and 3 stars.  Hence the 2!\nI arrived at the course all excited to play.  My group and I had a tee time at 9:30.  \nWe arrived at 8:45 with the intention of using their practice facility and putting green to warm up.  Well we walk into the clubhouse to check in and the employee informs me that my tee time got cancelled.  With a dumbfounded look on my face I ask WHAT? \n They said \"yes, I don't know what happened but your time was cancelled and filled with somebody else.\"\nI ask \"How can that be?\"\nResponse \"I don't know\"?\nME: well what can we do about this\nResponse: We can try and send you out at 10:50?\nME: No that won't work because we have other plans and had a tee time at 9:30.  This screw up is not our fault.\nResponse: Well let me see.  It looks like someone called in to cancel.  \nME; HUH??, dumbfounded look???\nResponse: Well, I don't know what to tell you.  It's either 10;50 or later.  We're really booked up.\nME: This is a real inconvenience.  It is the mistake of the golf course and somebody that works here.  How are you going to make this right?\nResponse:  After looking, We can send you out right now.  But that's all we can do.  \n\nNot wanting to wait over 2 hours to play a round that should've started 45 minutes from the time we arrived at the course, my party and I reluctantly agreed.  It made our front 9 horrible because of no warm up or practice time.  They took a little off our green fee to try and make up for the inconvenience but everything should've been handled way better.  The course wasn't even in the best condition.  When I saw it on Big Break, the greens and fairways looked completely different.     Very Upsetting!
0 ||| This place is for people whose palate has yet to evolve beyond Spaghetti-Ohs.\nDeli products are overpriced.\nAnd the sandwiches are as disappointing as my effort in the bedroom. \nNot really.\n\nYeah...really.\n[sigh]
1 ||| I really enjoy the atmosphere however the food is worse than a microwave dinner. I think the buy bing bags of stirfry from costco!!\n\nWe got there and they didnt seat us for 30mins. When there were tables. Then we got seated and didnt get the food for 1 and a half hours. \n\nWe kept trying to grab the witress but she would avoid us. Then we would ask othe waitresses and they said the would check.\n\nPeople were coming and going that got there after us!!!\n\nFinally I got aggressive with our waitress and we saw her walk to the chef and put in our order!!!\n\nShe forgot to put in our order!!!\n\nSince she wanted to pretend like it was just taking a long time she fucked the whole order up because she was going off memory and couldnt ask us because then we would know.\n\nThe food came finally and it was all crap we didnt even order!!!\n\nWe told her to forget the whole thing we are leaving and not paying.\n\nShe grabbed her manager who told us. \n\n\"she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there. I can take it off the bill but there is a good chance we will get her fired. Or the waitress will pay for half out of her pocket\"\n\nWTF!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOf course I told her the whole meal needs to be free and it was extremely unprofessional that she would blame a waitress getting fired because we waited a total of 2 hrs for the wrong meals we didnt eat!!\n\nIt would have been rated a zero star but I gave it 2 because now they are a bar too and that portion is pretty cool.
2 ||| I went here yesterday while I was out downtown and ordered a corned beef sandwich on an onion roll. Contrary to the menu posted at the front of the deli, which mentioned potato salad or pasta salad as a choice of side dish, I was automatically given fries as a side, which was fine by me. My corned beef was satisfactory, but I have definitely had better. There is also not a large selection on the menu, but the list of menu options works for a restaurant of this size. This makes for a good and convenient lunch destination if you work downtown and want something other than a burger or a sub, but next time around I will probably go with my gut and choose Baja Fresh.
1 ||| OMG, what is up with this company?  I saw a blood drive sign at work and said to myself \"Why not?  It's been a long time.\"  What in the hell did I get myself into?  \n\nAt the drive, they couldn't get my blood pressure and I was told by law they could only try twice.  Okay no problem I'll try again the next day.  Went in as a walk in, same thing, couldn't get my pressure.  Well I guess the two try rule went out the window as they checked my arm over and over again.  I even took my shirt off so they could try bare skin.  They left scratches and bruises on my arm then finally gave up.  \n\nI made an appointment for the next available day.  (I guess I was feeling guilty for not having a heartbeat.)  I got two e-mail reminders and a phone call to let me know I had an appointment.  (It was only one day apart.)  The lady that interviewed me took my blood pressure on my lower arm and got it on the first try.  They really pushed the double red cell donation and I said it would be okay.  It made me feel like crap all the next day, all I did was sleep.\n\n The next day I get a call asking why I missed my appointment.  Now they are calling me again, two days later.  They got their damn blood and I feel like I'm being stalked.  Now I'm getting a reminder of why I stopped giving in the first place.  Now, if your a blood donor please keep donating, but for me I think I'm done.
4 ||| I love Community Florist!  I use them to get bimonthly flowers to decorate my salon and I also used them for my wedding.  They worked with my budget and I couldn't believe how many flower arrangements I got for what I spent. I was also able to make payments which really helped.  My bridal bouquet was absolutely stunning and matched my personality and accented my dress.  Their prices are amazing as well and they can work with any budget.  Over the last year I have purchased arrangements to celebrate birthdays, love, accidents and even death.  I can go in there and give them a bit of history of why I need an arrangement and tell them a bit about the person and they create the most perfectly beautiful personalized one.  You can also get amazing terrariums created here as well.  They also have classes on floral arranging.  Thank you Community Florist for bringing such wonderful flowers into my life!
3 ||| I like this store chain- I have a member card so I save 10% every time I make a purchase- believe me, it's worth it. (Also a Hawaiian Miles Mall participant. Free shipping on the website with orders of $50 or more.) \n\nGreat products- body butter, gifts, and foot kits. \n\nI don't go to this one as much as the others, but I can tell you this much: this location is the new & improved location- bigger space- probably one of the bigger locations in town, as a matter of fact. Would stop here if I'm in the area.
2 ||| On Friday I came to Oriental Express to have lunch, thinking it was just another normal fast Chinese joint. I was surprised to find plastered on their windows:  (which reads Chung-Hwa Roo - Chinese Food) ... Korean people! So I thought that I might be able to find some good Korean fare. Which I did, in part.\n\nFirst, the restaurant itself was very clean, very organized. There were two very nice Korean ladies at the counter. One was apparently responsible for the sushi bar, and another was taking food orders. I was disappointed to find the amount of Korean fare very limited. The menu was chock full of the typical chinese dishes: rice plus meat plus sauce. On the specials board I did see the all important  (Bulkogi - Korean BBQ beef) - which I did order to go (due to the short lunch break at work). They did produce the dish very quickly (within 5 minutes or so) \n\nSo, the quality of the Bulkogi was a C. It was good, bona fide Bulkogi. It tasted pretty good. But it was average, nothing special. The rice was done well. I did admire their packaging though. They made a little aluminum foil bowl for the bulkogi itself so it didn't bleed into the rice (a very Korean and Japanese thing to do).\n\nThe overall grade is a C. \n\nBreakdown:\nFood -      C            (See above) \nService -  B            Service was good and efficient. The ladies \n                               behind the counter were very nice. \n\nDemerits:  Average, typical \"Chinese\" menu, no real Korean food other than the Bulgogi.
4 ||| We bought a new watch for our son that really didn't cost much.  However, the band wasn't the greatest as he is a thin kid and they didn't have enough loop things and one of them broke, so the strap was just stuck out.  Really annoying.\n\nHe loved the watch but the analog clock's battery needed replacing.  \n\nI've already been to Connie's twice before for other watches, one being last week.  I called her up and she said there is no way to fix a leather band, but she had some inexpensive ones and could find something that will go with the watch.\n\nYesterday I took the watch in, she found a band close to what my son had, put it on, had her throw the old one away and she replaced the battery of the part of the watch that needed it. It was very quick and easy.\n\nConnie is a delight to deal with and I really enjoy going in there.  It almost makes me want to buy a watch, except I hate wearing watches.  But, maybe I'll get the kids a couple more watches.\n\nI know Connie will always do a great job servicing the watches with excellent, personable customer service.   The battery replacements and bands are very reasonable and affordable.  I believe the battery replacements for the watches for my kids have been in the range of $7.  I highly recommend her!!!
3 ||| We went to Bob Taylor's for the umpteenth time last nite.  It's close to our house and when we crave big beef, it's our first choice.  I always have the smoked prime rib, the only thing I really enjoy there (however, I have never had the lamb, so maybe next time!)  I have had both the twice baked and the regular baked potatoes, and they are both good.  I love their cheese bread that starts the meal, and I have never had appetizers mainly because the main course is usually more than enough for dinner.\n\nI have found their creamed soups to be akin to library paste, so mostly always get the salad, which is pretty non-descript but adequate.  \n\nI usually get the 12-oz prime rib, medium, and can never finish it,  and the smoked flavor is mild, but adds so much to the meat.  \n\nFor the first time ast night we had the all you can eat ribs for $15.99 (every Tuesday), and the ribs were very tender but had an odd herb either in the BBQ sauce or the rib marinade which I think was rosemary, but it didn't appeal to me at all.  My husband liked them, but neither of us could finish the first serving which was very generous, so that was all we could eat.\n\nThey also have a nice wine selection and what I think are very reasonable prices compared to so many of the restaurants which have 150-200% markups on wine.\n\nService is always good there, very attentive and friendly, and I am so glad they DO NOT have TVs with sports shows on in the restaurant.!!!!
3 ||| I was in and out fast thanks to Fran. She made sure the fragile item was packed appropriately. \n\nThe store was clean and conveniently located off of Bell Rd.
3 ||| If you have time to look you should be able to find something you like here at a great price.
0 ||| The staff here was quite friendly, but the fact that people love Monical's pizza leads me to believe they have never had pizza before.  Its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top.
2 ||| I'm new to climbing so I've not got much to compare this place to. So far I've loved the place and have had no qualms except that the music selection. Mix it up guys... Something other than classic rock, please. \nGood hours, nice staff (a little absent at times but still genuinely nice and helpful), clean place, some of the holds slip which is not good so sure they could work on tightening ish up especially since we're climbing on it and can get seriously hurt. \nMonday nights get busy. Other wise it's pretty chill.
4 ||| Been in this branch a couple of times now and the staff is always nice and very helpful
2 ||| For some reason, I thought custard was going to be so amazing. It was rather good, but not the best cold treat I've ever eaten.\n\nFirst of all, the location is kind of shady. I would suggest going with a large group, especially late at night. It is in Downtown Las Vegas, in the AM/PM lot, kind of tucked behind it. Also, there's no seating and just a window for ordering. I would consider this a food stand, but even food stands occasionally provide seating.\n\nI got the Western, which was a little over $6. If you aren't sharing, I suggest getting the junior size. The caramel and pecans were flavorful. The custard was also good.\n\nI probably won't go back here. I personally prefer frozen yogurt over custard, but this might be something new to try if you like custard.
4 ||| I have used Kendall Plumbing & Rooter for my management company KRK Realty for the past 15 years.  I have found them to be prompt and fair.  Kevin Kirkwood
1 ||| I was craving Dairy Queen for quite awhile.  When I finally went I was wondering what I wanted it so badly for?  I ordered a grape freeze.  The icey slush mixed with soft serve vanilla.  It was was so mediocre.  I felt like I was wasting calories for the day.  If I want a treat I can think of such better/higher quality treats and ice cream.
4 ||| Dr.Faro has been seeing my 5 kiddos for over 10 years... That says alot for me... He is the kindest and most compassionate man. One of my kiddos is special needs and he goes above and beyond to make sure she has all the equipment she needs. His office staff works so hard with my insurance company and liz has written countless letters to help us get nursing hours and medical equipment secured again for our daughter... This office, doctor and staff have truly gone out of their way countless times to accomodate the needs of our family. I couldnt imagine taking my kiddos anywhere else for a pediatrician. I have referred several friends and they too have been extremely pleased with this office and staff as well.
0 ||| These have to be one of prettiest but worse managed apartment complexes in the valley. On the surface you would automatically want to live in these apartments just off their appearance but don't be fooled because the management staff at this location is HORRIBLE and don't care whatsoever. I had an issue where maintenance was entering my  apartment because they \"thought\" I had moved out. My lease wasn't up for another month and though I had already moved most of my belongings out I still had a few items in the apartment. Well maintenance decided they would take it upon themselves and \"clean\" the apartment so it could be ready for someone else to move in, while I'm still paying rent for this apartment. In doing so they threw away the belongings I had in the apartment including clothes & towels. Not only had they entered to \"clean\" the apartment once but TWICE! After the first incident I went up to the office and they said \"oh we're not sure if someone has been in your apartment\". Huh?? So silly me I thought that there was NO WAY they would make the mistake of coming back prematurely again after I just went to complain...WRONG! They entered the apartment again without my permission the following week and again threw away my belongings. This time I went to the management office and one girl was trying to contact maintenance to get to the bottom of this. Then out of nowhere here comes the head manager not saying hi & even asking me what happened; she immediately goes on the defensive and says her guys weren't in my apartment and that I need to file a police report because apparently someone must've broken into my apartment. I proceeded to ask her who would break into an apartment lock the door afterwards and CLEAN IT UP??? After she realized she was making no sense she refused talk or help me anymore and said there was nothing they could do. The funny part is I could hear the head maintenance guy in the other lady's office saying \"yeah I went in there the other day because I thought it was vacant...but once I saw some clothes I just moved the blinds over and walked out.\" So they were clearly lying to me at the leasing office to cover their own butts. I was highly disappointed in this complex because it is such a beautiful complex but don't be fooled like I was...don't move here! Not to mention they're overpriced.
1 ||| Awful service!!!! Our servers walked by us many times and didn't even bat an eyelash. Served everyone even if they sat after us.  Apparently someone was more important at the next table because they had servers just standing around and chatting with them.  And while they asked for extra sauce (The waiter even offered to go to the nearby Chinese restaurant to get the sweet and sour sauce) we were still waiting for our meal.  And by the time we got our steaks, they were noticeably dry.  The sides weren't all that.  Not only were they bland, the cream corn was so hot that I burned my mouth and didn't get to fully enjoy my meal.  \n\nEating at an upscale steakhouse at Sunset Station is already random, but the experience wasn't even worth it.
0 ||| Worst McDonalds!!! they took 45 min for one burger BULLSHIT!!! someone needs fired!
0 ||| Will never go again. Went based off a review about this restaurant that really hyped out this place. What a let down due to the food. You can tell that this is a OLD restaurant with a very OLD clientele who are use to the OLD way of doing things.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm a strong believer of 'if ain't broke, don't fix it.'   But I could totally see this place featured on FOX Kitchen Nightmares. Lets focus on the good: Great service, speedy food service and great wine list.\nThe bad: Old furniture, plates, glasses, decor and horrible paint job. Made me not want to eat,  I was worried that I might catch something. Lastly, the driest chicken, and steak me and my date ever had.
0 ||| Too bad there is no way to give negative stars. This the worst hotel I have been at in 30 years.\n\nThe good: Our room was clean and had a comfortable bed.\n\nThe bad: Everything else. \nOur problems started at check in when one of the two rooms we had reserved weeks in advanced was not ready. \"Come back at five oclok\" they said. \n\nThe elevator was next. It was dirty with missing floor tile, indicator lights out and wires dangling from the ceiling from a fan that did't work.\n\nOur room was as poorly maintained as the elevator. Running tub faucet, electrical receptacles with out covers, receptacles so lose, I was not able to plug in my phone in as they retreated into the box. I had to pull out the bed to find the only receptacle I could use.  No clock radio as advertised.\n \nThe AC/Heater sounds like a car starting up when it turned on.\n\nThe sink had no drain plug. One of the light bulbs above the sink was out.\nThe smoke detector was dangling from the ceiling by the wires.\nThe bed had not been made by housekeeping on the second mourning.\n\nWe had to call for extra towels for our room since the had only provided one bath towel. The next day housekeeping took the extra towels and left us without hand towels and wash cloths.\n\nThe free breakfast was designed so the guests would not use it. They supplied coffee, milk, fruit punch and imitation OJ. Make your own waffles, cereal and bread for toasting. One of the toasters was missing its handle.\n\nWe couldn't get in to the room on the second night. They changed the lock so our key card wouldn't work. I guess they figured no one would want to stay another night here. We stayed because we had prepaid, and the hotels no refund policy. They would probably loos all there guests the next day if they gave refunds.
2 ||| Went in here to grab a last minute item I needed for an outfit.  I wasn't going to hold my breath here either, I know it's a Marshalls and that doesn't always mean the best selection.  It's hit or miss no matter what you are looking for.\n\nThis day, was a hit, maybe even a home run.  I do have to admit, the Kenneth Cole shirt I got not only looked great on me, but made my wallet feel even better!
3 ||| Club Cafe is great.  \n\nIt's small and cozy (which works for the type of shows they do) and it's got a great vibe.  The appetizers and drinks are all good and we were happy with the beer selection.  I was also impressed with how friendly and helpful the door staff and waitresses were.  The sound in Club Cafe really was good, especially for a small venue.
0 ||| Unlike others, I did not find the owner friendly. I found him to be a bag of douche of galactic proportions.\n\nI suppose this place is OK for average bikes needing average repairs, but when I brought in my road bike for a repair of moderate difficulty for any competent bike shop, because the owner was incapable of doing the repair he chose to insult me by telling me I should sell my bike and get something more appropriate for someone of my physique. \n\nAt the moment I'm a little overweight, but here's the facts: every summer I road bike in Italy. I have summited Mt. Terminillo. I have gone up and down the hills of Umbria as a member of a local riding club. I have ridden legs of various stages where the Giro d'Italia is run. I am capable of riding as much as 200 miles/week. I can summit South Mountain 3x in a go.\n\nI have ridden literally thousands of miles on this very bicycle, which -while carbon fiber - is FAR from a pro racing model. But this nitwit thinks I should sell my road bike because it's \"too advanced for me\". Oh and I'm a fat motherhumper too, thanks and come back again soon!\n\n\"Try me\"? I did. You and your sad little bike shop in the ghetto failed.\n\n---\nEdited to add: since my encounter with this obnoxious tool, I found a friendly bike shop which had no interest in fat-shaming me. I told the story about this dickwad and all of the employees were aghast. They fixed my bike wheel so that I could ride again. I'm doing 200 miles a week (yes really) and have dropped 7 lbs in 3 weeks. By August I should be under 200 lbs, and when I go to Italy to ride up Mt. Terminillo again I will take a selfie.
1 ||| I heard that Mineo's had some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it did not live up to that. I had it delivered, so maybe that's where I went wrong, but overall it was still pretty bad. The flavor was good and I liked how they put the toppings below the cheese. On each slice though there was about 1/3 of inch of cheese, while the dough was barely existent. Just too much cheese. Also, it seems to be a Pittsburgh practice to not cook a pizza through, and Mineo's followed suit. So the thick cheese and soft dough kind of had the same consistency. Just not good pizza. And not to sound arrogant, but I'm from NY, and I might have a high bar for good pizza. Still though, I've had better pizza than this in Pittsburgh.
3 ||| 8/10/13 and 8/11/13 We stopped in to enjoy the bar.  They had Ale Asylum Hopalicious, Lake Louie Warped Speed Scotch Ale, and New Belgium Brewing Rampant Imperial IPA on draft along with several others.  Tasty craft beers found at a chain restaurant are rare from my experience.  We learned it was happy hour all day on Sunday for several food items.  Their chili nachos and Caesar salad were tasty.  We enjoyed their deep dish spinoccoli with sausage.  It's not on the menu, but they still make it.  They play a nice and varied mix of music and have several TV's for sports watching.  We plan on stopping in more frequently.  In the past this wasn't a personal favorite.
2 ||| Totally cute place with so-so service. I always get my boba tea to go so I don't really take advantage of the cuteness of the establishment.\nAnd when I say cute,... it's cute in that Starbucks of boba kinda way.\n\nI think this is a chain.\nI want to say that I've seen one of these in New York.\nBut... whatever.\n\nThe lychee crushed ice drink was delish.\nI had the medium and it was actually pretty big.\nI'd drop in here again after a visit to Ichiza maybe.\nBut I wouldn't make a special trip to come here.
2 ||| Stopped by here tonight with a few friends-- it wasn't what I expected. I have a few friends that rant and rave about this place, but I honestly found it to be okay. It wasn't fantabulous.\n\nFirst, they played country music. I love country, but I found it a little odd that it was playing at a pub.\n\nSecond, the food was ok. Our waitress said that the bread pudding was amazing...it was alright. Rula Bula's is much better.\n\nHowever, our waitress was the bomb. She made us Irish Mules even though they weren't on the menu :) And they were very good!!!\n\nAll in all, it was alright. I didn't think it was amazing, but it wasn't bad, either.
3 ||| Wahoo Skinny bowl is delicious! Very clean restaurant. Parking SUCKS!
3 ||| I have nothing overly detailed to add that other people haven't already said, but this place is basically my neighbor and I have only been there twice. \n\nBoth times though I was really impressed with their quality, and got a lot of food for my money. Yum!
4 ||| God this place is good.  Stepping into their dinning room is like being with friends.  It's quaint and comfortable and the servers are always friendly.  As for the food, it is equally as enjoyable.  The mac n cheese is to die for and the fish n chips is the best I've had in the valley.  Their homemade tartar sauce is what really sets them apart. \n\nIt's a little tucked away, but quite the gem.
4 ||| A great place to get flowers. \n\nIt was my wife's birthday and I wanted to get her some really nice roses. I didn't want to get her the cheap $5 roses that the downtown street vendors sell that die before you get them home and in water. \n\nI decided to give Oliver Flower Shop a try and I'm glad I did! I walked in and looked at all of the beautiful roses in the cooler and said to myself \"Now this is more like it!\" I was quickly greeted and asked for a dozen long stem roses. I picked six cream and six purple roses, (my wife's two favorite colors.) FTW! \n\nThe shop owner arranged and wrapped them up beautifully. But here's the shocker, when I went to pay and asked how much I owed he said $10.95! These roses are absolutely beautiful and I would have paid at least $20 or even $30 for them! He said that they have a sign outside that says a dozen roses for $10.95. I totally missed the sign. I guess my wife is right. She's always telling me I need glasses. \n\nSo I paid my $11.72 with tax and in 5 minutes I was on my way. \n\nF.Y.I. The roses are still alive as I type this.
2 ||| Bellacino's overall has pretty good pizza & above average subs, & you sure do get a large \"grinder\". Their grinders come loaded with toppings & are absolutely huge. And don't get Subway sizes mixed up in your head with Bellacino's, because if you order a full size grinder you'll be in for a shock. It's right around 20\", with the half grinder around 10\". Also, all of their grinders are over toasted so expect a crispy crust unless you specify otherwise. They have some pretty diverse grinder options to choose from, but you won't be too thrilled if you love to customize (they only have a few options there). \n\nOutside of the grinder realm, their pizzas are pretty good & greasy. Nothing too great though, but not too bad for the price & size. This is their other specialty based on their namesake, but I'd definitely choose grinder over pizza here. They do have other menu items, but I've never ventured into that realm.
4 ||| Love this restaurant!! Clean,amazing service and great food. I've loved everything I've tried, but the house chicken and xo string beans are my favorite! I've been several times and have also placed to go orders and have never been disappointed. If you like Chinese food, this place is a must. You are always greeted immediately and drinks are refilled as soon as your empty. They also give you free hot green tea. Can't say enough about how much I love this place!
1 ||| 2 Bad steaks at one table, side's were Meh.
2 ||| The ambiance was like Denny's, which has been commented on here before. The food was mediocre, the service was mediocre. I've had better in other cities, but I am still looking for my favorite breakfast place in the Valley.\n\nThere was nothing WRONG with the meal, but it was very forgetful.
1 ||| Have always enjoyed the Mediterranean food and very quick service here. However, the past two times my boyfriend and I have been to Aladdin's it has been bad news!\n\nSeveral months ago we were eating dessert and in the middle of the German chocolate cake we were sharing, we found a big green spot of mold!  So this means that the cake was old and/or stored at an incorrect temperature... gross either way.  The manager took the dessert off our bill and that was it.. no offer to discount the check, etc.  Think about it, we ate half of a piece of moldy cake that you served us.. not charging us for the cake is a  NO BRAINER.. but what are you going to do as a way of making this better? They did nothing and I don't like to make a scene so I let it go.\n\nA couple nights ago, recovered from the mold incident, we tried Aladdin's again.    But, my Kibbie was ice cold in the middle and had to be sent back.  It disrupted our meal and was an overall bad time.  Again,  no apology or offer to make it better.  \n\nI think management needs some retraining on how to make someone's bad experience OK again.  We have learned our lesson this time and won't be back; which is a shame because we used to really love it there.
3 ||| The chile pork verde and the jerk chicken salad were delish.....and holy hell, the chambord margaritas. Amazing and potent but if you've had little sleep and no food, take it easy on these....especially early in the day. I had two and was shitaaaaay. o_o
2 ||| I'm not a huge fan of buffet's.  Maybe it's because I'm trying to watch what I eat.  I have lost a lot of weight over the past year and, I have been avoiding buffets altogether.  It is so easy to overeat, especially when you have a plethora of fried, carb-ladened, fatty food to choose from.  Plus add a veritable myriad of dessert options.... oh boy! you can get into a lot of trouble.  But, I found myself coming here because the person I was with really wanted to get his money's worth.  So, we hit the Firelight Buffet at Sam's Town.\n\nWe got into line, which was really short, to pay for our buffet.  We were then led to a table and our drink orders were immediately taken.  Then we made the trek around the buffet offerings.  I walked around to see what the healthier options may be.  They had everything from, Chinese to Mexican food.  But, I passed and found some broiled chicken and also took a few cuts from the carving station.  My buddy took full advantage of the buffet.  He must have gone through 4 or 5 plates and then hit the ice cream section.  Firelight has a great selection of ice cream and someone scooping it out for you.  I think that is a great touch.\n\nSo, even though, I'm not a fan of buffet's in general, firelight took care of our needs.
3 ||| I did not expect this place to be a full service sit down restaurant. We showed up at noon on Sunday expecting to order a sandwich at a counter and look around at all the wonderful dessert items. Instead, we were instantly in the middle of a busy restaurant that offers a big selection of breakfast and lunch options. I don't think I have ever taken so long to decide on what to order. I chose the half order roast beef sandwich on a soft roll with a side of fries. Easily the best roast beef sandwich I have ever eaten! It was piled high with plenty of mayo, mustard, lettuce ,and tomatoes. The french fries were run of the mill and could have used more seasoning. Better yet- throw some gravy on those fries. I am so glad I ordered the half sandwich-- it was plenty! My wife ordered the half order brisket sandwich with a bowl of chicken soup that we heard so much about. The soup itself was good, but had a dill flavor that was overpowering in my opinion. On the other hand, the brisket was tender and delicious. \n\nOur bill was a little over $20.00, and the service was great! Considering this place is a bakery, I was disappointed in the baked goods available for sale at the counter. I saw a few cookies, but was hoping to find an eclair, pastry, or cake to try out.  \n\nI am giving this place a solid 4 star rating for the sandwiches, portions, and service. I will definitely be back to sample their breakfast menu.
2 ||| First time trying sushi...not my favorite, but I did like this restaurant. Had the California Delight rolls, Rainbow Rolls and Lite Teriyaki Bowl, all of which were decent. But the soup was wonderful! The atmosphere was really cool too, totally serene. My friends all had a great time and they said their food was excellent. The layout of ordering was a bit confusing, because we came in on the cusp of the lunch express and the dinner. But we figured it out! However, the barely 19 year old woman at the register was NOT friendly, to me or anyone else. Eastwinds, you may want to hire away from the local supply of brainless girls fresh of out Horizon who obviously have no chance of surviving in the real world.
2 ||| I am somewhat torn on my rating. But I guess I will give an explaination for it. That will come a little ltr.\n\nSo a long day of hiking and rock hopping over creeks in Sedona I was famished.  Checked out best places in Sedona and Fork in the Road Bistro came up. Get there and it does not open until 4pm. So my friend suggested we just continue on toward Phoenix.  He says there is this place he has been wanting to go to in Black Canyon and it is always packed in the parking lot. \n\nWe get there... finally.  I can hardly contain myself.  I am so hungry I can't stand it. I am very close to turning into Nikzilla, the evil hungry foodie.  Upon pulling up I can clearly see this is not a place I would frequent or pick to eat at.  But hey what the heck.\n\nWe are seated in the cafe and it is dark and westerny...I know that is not a word but work with me.  We get the menu and it is a small menu.  Which makes me a bit more at ease being that if you only have a few items you must do them well.  My companion orders a ham and cheese melt with fries and I get the country fried steak.  The country fried steak had a little star next to it and I asked my elderly waitress what did it mean and it was a curt I don't know.  OK so you work here and don't know what the stars on a few select dishes mean.  Whatever. Our food comes quickly and there is coleslaw on my plate.  UGHHH I tell the waitress to please take it away and bring me something else.  She returns with peas straight from the can.  Wow it's school lunch all over again. AWWWW.  I am starving so anything would taste good at this point.  I have to say my meal was mediocre.  Nothing to write home about.  The steak was cooked nicely but lacked flavor.  The baked potato was right on and so was the Texas toast.  \n\nNow time for dessert.  It seems that the parking lot was full of people coming to get whole pies.  Our waitress comes back and we inquire about the pies.  We decide on pecan and she states they are out of regular pecan pie but have the Jack Daniels version.  My friends asks her about the taste and she is hilarious.  She says it is disgusting.  Well I appreciate the honesty and we order a slice of the apple crumb pie.  It is beyond delicious.  Flaky, cinnamon and the apples are just the right texture.  Yummy I order a whole pie to take home to the funny farm.  It was a very reasonable $14.95.  This pie must weigh 5lbs.  It is so heavy.  Just like Grandma use to make. \n\nWell the family was excited about the pie when I got home.  We added some vanilla ice cream and it was even better than at the Cafe.\n\nThe food is nothing to holler about.  There are much better places in Sedona.  So I would suggest eating there if you can.  The food is not awful just not great.  The pies ohhh the pies are so worth the stop.
4 ||| The bartenders always know how make interesting shots!  Plus they have their \"Slay the dragon\" t-shirt for drinking all the beers.  Yeah...the shirt itself isn't amazing, but I'm down for any drinking contest.\n\nI love the cranky old man owner.  He's a Man U fan so he's even better!  Go Red Devils!
4 ||| The hubs and I went here a few weeks ago looking for an entertainment center. We ended up leaving with out an entertainment center but a brand new sectional instead! \n\nThe hubs and I had no plans to buy, but when we saw the sectional we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never agree on anything when it comes to decor so we knew we had to buy, but we weren't a fan of the color or material. Oscar helped us out. We got to custom order a couch with out paying anything additional!!! How rad is that! The Roomstore lets you change out fabrics and even switch out pillow patterns. Only bummer is since its custom we have to wait 6-8 weeks. But that's ok, we will wait! \n\nThanks to Oscar for not only helping us out but not hovering over us like a vulture like some furniture stores do!
3 ||| Finally decided to pay a visit here after taking the kids to Freedom Park - I've seen Pike's from the light rail and always wondered what it was like. \n\nDecor-wise it's a funky mix of old fashioned soda shop (complete with wooden floorboards) mixed with gentrified warehouse chic (complete with exposed girders). The outdoor patio looks really inviting and mellow, especially considering the location (busy corner in the South End). \n\nThe menu has a plethora of diner/soda shop standards, notably burgers, sandwiches, and comfort food like fried chicken and meatloaf. The kids ordered the hot dog and grilled cheese kids meals, along with the upgraded milk shakes (of course!). Based on the advice from our server I ordered the Carolina Classic burger - you guessed it, 1/2 pd patty with chili, coleslaw, mustard and onions. Asked for their house chips on the side. \n\nSome observations: \n1. The kids meals are impressive in both their size and quality - the hot dog was a kosher beef one, grilled perfectly. Came with two sides, fresh fruit and the house made chips. The grilled cheese was also high quality and overflowing with gooey monterey jack. For the extra $1, the small milkshakes are a steal! \n2. The house made potato chips rock -perfectly fried and salted. Completely addictive. They should really create some sort of nacho dish with these. . .if you ladle their house made chili and sprinkle some cheddar on top you would have a heavenly appetizer. \n3. While the burger was very good (cooked on a griddle, which I prefer) the chili was stupendous! Meaty, complex, thick - perfect for a burger and made me want to scoop up the leftovers with the chips! \n\nService-wise, no complaints - prompt, friendly and honest. \n\nOverall this was a great experience and I recommend it to anyone in the Dilworth/South End/Uptown area. Great option if you are at Freedom Park or Nascar Hall of Fame and want a comfortable place for you and the family.
4 ||| Wow! Great customer service.  I have been calling around looking for stores to donate for a food drive, and although Food City cannot currently donate due to their own financial situation, they were encouraging and let me know that I should try them again in the future.  The gentleman who spoke with me took his time and kindness radiated from his voice.  Thank you, sincerely.
3 ||| I've shopped at Pets Inc since 1986 and they're really the best pet store in the valley. The focus here is mainly reptiles, small furry creatures, and fresh and marine aquaria. All of the aquariums and terrariums are very clean and well maintained, while the animals appear to be in excellent health. \n\nThe only lose a star for the staff. Overall, they are super knowledgeable and are helpful, but you need to approach them. One or two arrogant department workers are unpleasant to deal wth, btu know their stuff.
3 ||| As we parked we said \"Woo HOO!  Unlimited fries!!!\"   Why do I mention that first?  Well, I suppose it's important to know that they have unlimited fries, but more important here is knowing the level of culinary excellence we were looking for in this eating experience.  We were out.  We were hungry.  We wanted some place we didn't eat all the time and presto - there it was.  It had been a few years since I'd last been to a Red Robin, and based on this experience - I might go a bit more often.\n\nAs we walk in - the hostess area has lots of room for seating and even has a small arcade with about 6 old school video games.  Very cool if you are waiting for a large party, have a long wait , or (let's be honest) if the kids finish eating before you do and you want them to go kill some time so you can eat in peace.  I'm sure your server would be happy to give you quarters.\n\nTheir menu is one giant page, stuff on both sides.  I was IMPRESSED with their variety.  Burgers (Beef, Fish, Chicken, Boca, Gardenburger etc) are their main entree here - though they also have \"dinners\".  They really stretch the burger concept.  Beyond what I mentioned above - which all come in many forms, they also had a Pot Roast Burger (Totally trying that one next time) and a Carnitas burger.  Not your momma's burgers.  I tried the Carnitas burger and my companion had the Whiskey BBQ Bacon burger.  We were tempted to start with their tower of Onion rings (did I mention this was not a diet day?) but decided it was WAY too big for the two of us.  The server mentioned they could do a half order and we caved in.  They were yummy.  Nothing out of this world, but very good.  Came w/ Ranch and a special sauce that the server mentioned was a BBQ + Ranch w/ a kick.  It was interesting.  \n\nHer more traditional burger was definitely awesome.   First bite to last - though she only got through the first half of the burger while there and the rest went home.  My carnitas burger was... good.   It was good.  It was far from great, but it was juicy and warm and had some decent flavor.  It said it came w/ onions, but unfortunately these weren't cooked with the carnitas - or at all.  A slice of white onion wasn't bad, but grilled onions would have been much better.  \n\nNeither of us liked our drinks - I got the tea and she the lemonade - so we decide to return those and drink water w/ dinner and splurge on splitting a shake as the folks at the table next to us were raving about how the shake was better than 5 & Diner.  Their shakes normally have a \"reserve\" container, but the server was nice enough to just split it for us into 2 glasses w/ our own whip cream and sprinkles.  We asked for them to do a chocolate banana shake (they offered the flavors individually) and it was amazing.  Real pieces of banana in the shake.  Super chocolaty.  It was my companions favorite part of the meal.  (Eating with eyes closed kind of good)\n\nBest part?  The whole thing was $26 + tip.  We were stuffed and leaving w/ half of our sandwiches and some of those amazing all you can eat steak fries to have as our \"snack\" for later.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't as upscale as say... a Chilli's (wow, that sounds so sad!) but it is super family friendly.  It's clean.  The service was attentive, friendly and offered suggestions.  \n\nAnd don't forget the all you can eat steak fries...
0 ||| This hospital sucks. They will keep you here if you have insurance and not feed you or do anything helpful. My aunt came here after the paramedics took her to Sun Rise hospital, but they were full. They kept her here over night.  There were no doctors on the floor to check up on her and the nurses kept telling us the doctor will be in at a certain time and when it came that certain time they told us he'll be in later... and then later turned into \"I dont know when the doctor is coming in\". This place is very unprofessional.
2 ||| I'm not a gourmet coffee fan.  For the most part I think gourmet tastes like dirt, or is way to strong.  With that said the coffee here was pretty good.  It was a bit annoying asking for a coffee and having to look at the board as to which one I wanted.  The house blend was nice though.  The place is cozy looking.  The staff was friendly.
3 ||| I like driving clean cars.  I am too lazy to wash it myself.  Hence my frequent visits to Octopus.  I usually go with the Diamond Wash (skip the fragrances unless you want to smell like a pimp or some artificial unknown fruit from another planet).  Although a little pricey, you can return within 3 days and get another wash for $2.99.  It comes in handy if I am doing a little roadtripping over a weekend and want it so fresh so clean for the upcoming week.
4 ||| This place is awesome! I regularly go to this place and have had a great experience every time. I make sure to book an appointment ahead of time, and get in and out of there in less than 45 minutes. One time I was there, they had 3 guys all working on finishing my car at the same time to make sure I got out in time. They do a great job every time. Highly recommended.
1 ||| The review filter thing really helped out Saigon Noodle. I was impressed by the number of one and two star reviews that Yelp removed! My problem with this place isn't the food - it is the SERVICE. It is HORRIBLE. We were seated and waited -20- minutes to even take an order or even order drinks. 20 minutes, I am not kidding. The waittress was plenty nice but wow, 20 minutes. And even when we had our food, not a single check-in with us despite our empty glasses. I'm not sure the point of having a restaurant with GOOD FOOD but absolutely PISS POOR service.
0 ||| Everytime I come here some \"customer\" is always running out this store with a unpaid item.
3 ||| A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the idea of a pool hall and when I looked up the location, I realized this had some other name when we were in high school and has been around for a long time. \n\nThe whole Metro Center area has changed a lot over the years. Back in the 80's it was a great place to cruise (when we weren't on Central Avenue), but I digress. I borrowed mom's car, drove from Sun City and arrived close to the start time of the get together. I have been friends with Kari since we were 15 and by coming to town for her birthday weekend, was able to see some women I hadn't seen since we finished high school(back in 1989, yeah I know....)\n\nI had very low expectations and I was glad. The place is pretty run down but super low key. Had I been there for other reasons, I would have entered into one of their nightly poker tournaments, but I was there for other reasons. There was a small group of people for this shindig-around 15 at one point but really about 10 for the long haul. No one ended up playing pool, but there were tons of tables, along with darts and some video games. They had a great jukebox and we had a blast playing all sorts of music from several different decades. They offer food (no one ordered any), a full bar and lots of specials on beer. The cocktail waitresses were very nice but that could be because I tip very well, but it was fun. \n \nThis place could use a really good cleaning as I left smelling like something stale/moldy. Not such a good thing when only in town for the weekend with limited clothing. Thank you Febreeze!
1 ||| Blah. This place recently had a car back into it. It was the karma gods at work telling this business that they needed to fix some things. And since they were stalling they caused someone to try and put their own drive through in. Thankfully nobody got seriously hurt in that ordeal but now maybe they'll clean this place up. When I went in I was not impressed by the pricing, selection,or the floor layout. Compared to other thrift stores in Vegas / Hendertucky you can typically find better, more interesting stuff at lower cost by walking out the front door. This is a shame as the Salvation Army is one group I don't mind supporting. But this store does not really do them justice. Steer clear, heck even Savers beats this place and I think Savers sucks.
0 ||| This was the worst hotel that I ever stayed in. my hubby and I  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that I wanted to throw up. I was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed. in the morning at 5am I wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up! I felt so dirty that I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought that I will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel.
0 ||| This is the worst place ever for Chinese food. My boyfriend who is full Chinese couldn't even stomach more than four bites. The food was worse than Americanized Chinese. It smelled bad, tasted like greasy feet, and was just not fresh or hot. The price is cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.
4 ||| Such friendly & talkative staff, always willing to help...even suggest color for your nails.  Give good advice & don't lead u astray.  My feet are gorgeous & my brows are re-shaped.
3 ||| I like this place. It's clean and big, and always has a ton of staff. They are incredibly friendly and do fast, great work. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Plus they always accommodate you to make sure you can get in, even as a walk-in customer. They'll even stay late to make sure you get taken care of.
1 ||| Hadn't been here in about a year. Now I remember why. Food is nothing special. They used to have really good carne asada tacos and pork medallions on menu over a year ago. Have tried a few menu items since then and always a bit disappointing.  I like the ambience and the staff are always friendly.  Won't be back anytime soon because the food is not that good,  unfortunately.  They need new food items on the menu.
0 ||| This business has been here for several years, and how its survived I'll never know. The kids that are employed here must get paid next to nothing, cause every time I get up the nerve to try them again, its a whole new crew. Each seems to sass and ignore the customers worse than the last crew did. The wings are good, and I guess its just the fact that there's no competition that they make enough to stay open. This place would kill if the staff just PRETENDED to care about customers. Example: Last time I ordered wings, I knew they would take FOREVER, so I didn't even leave my house for a while. Then when I got there, I was waiting and wanted to pay my bill so I could leave when they got ready. Couldn't do THAT!!!! Had to finish cooking them to release the ticket so she could ring it up. So, they must have waited to start them until I got there, 'cause it was well over ten minutes later when they finally came to the front. (WTF?, WHY CALL AHEAD?????) Then, she was busy helping other people that must not have been able to read a menu, or understand english, and it took several minutes more for her to get my money, so I COULD FINALLY GET MY CARCASS OUT OF THAT PLACE!!!. EVERY time I've been in this place, must be a dozen by now, its been some sort of \"Don't give a flying +++\" attitude that just insults me to the point I don't want to come back. Presently, I have a STRONG hankering for some of their wings, but it just hasn't been long enough that I'm willing to go back.
3 ||| I went here for lunch time.\n\nRestaurant Feel - Romantic. The ceiling is pretty intriguing. \n\nService - Timely, the waitress is very nice and respectful. \n\nFood Quality - I ordered 2 oysters. One from the East and One from the West. The one from the west coast wasn't that great =T. The one from the east was very sweet, as fresh seafood should be. I tried the bisque, which was pretty tasty. I also had the fish and chips, which was pretty nice. Crunchy, flaky batter, delicious fish. Very nice.
3 ||| I love this place! Especially the outdoor section. So many fun finds and it changes all the time. I have found so many great things here. My only complaint is the prices. They are, at times a bit out of line.
2 ||| I'll go three stars.  For Phoenix, it's good to have some of these around to keep a large selection of instruments floating around the valley.\n\nYes, GC is the devil, who puts little guys out of biz while bringing up the douche quality of musicians everywhere.  They have annoying sales people who are dangerously uninformed while being horribly brash.  They have plenty of crap product and they will sell it to you with glee.\n\nThere are a few saving graces.  1) I play acoustic guitars.  They have a nice selection at several price points which aren't all that horribly priced.  You can play the $3k Martins without being bugged and can stay for hours (sometimes a bad thing when old farts decide to play concerts loudly) 2) The sales people are dying to make a sale.  If you are going to spend money, they will bargain, just have to push.  3) If you buy used stuff from them from a brand they don't really carry, it may be priced to get out the door.  They are afraid they won't sell the stuff and it will just take up space.\n\nI hate guitar center except for the acoustic room.  There's always someone playing everything too loud.  The staff will always show off on your interest before they let you play it.  They are the Walmart of music.
0 ||| I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \"corporate recipe\", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \"signature\" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire.
1 ||| Edible! Not quite Bojangles or KFC! About the same type of fried chicken.\n\nBojangles-better biscuits\nKFC-better cole slaw
1 ||| Family lunch on Sunday of LDW. No problem. & that's where my compliments end.\n\nThe servers and their attitude was really awful. It can't be attributed to a language barrier as there's so speaking involved when dropping off beverages, dishes or extra plates and utensils. \n\nEven the manager, who eventually was called over to assist - had an attitude displayed all over her face like it was a burden for her to take our order. They were pretty quick in bringing over the bill though. \n\nI have to say - I did enjoy a few of the dishes however, the entire experience was spoiled with how the servers provided very little service, that was heavy on the attitude. \n\nI won't be back.
0 ||| Probably the worst experience I have had at any restaurant in the Phoenix area. It took 10 minutes for the hostess to even appear to seat us. Our waitress came to the table 4 times as she and all the other waitresses and staff were more worried about following the manager around playing around and flirting. But the worst part was the food by far. The tempura shrimp and veggies were soggy and the sushi was something I could get in a grocery store.... Gross!
0 ||| I contacted them to replace the springs on my  leather couch. At first they seemed really helpful and interested in the work. I talked to the owner who was supposed to call me back to schedule when to come look at the couch and take it to their shop. That phone call never happened. I even called and left a message with the receptionist and he never called back. So the next day I called again and talked to him. He didn't care at all that he didn't call me back. He flatly told me that he was busy and that I was 1 of 20 people he needed to call or that had called him. Great that he is that busy but if he continues to disregard potential customers like he did me he won't be busy for much longer.
0 ||| I just wanted to say out of all the hotels in the valley I chose Sheraton Wild Horse Pass for  me and my wife to stay the night and celebrate on the joyous occasion for New Years Eve.  It was very disturbing saying the very least when the fire alarm went off around 4 a.m. in our wing and immediately we jumped from a dead sleep.  As I proceeded into the hallway people were looking at each other saying is this a false alarm without knowing what to assume.  I personally felt systems should of been in place to where the management staff should of been there conveying whether to get out of the building or it is simply a false alarm.  Think we both can agree moments in a real fire can have serious and disastrous consequences.  After the alarm stopped we were way too alert to even thing about falling back to sleep so needless to say we left after 4:45 this morning.  Personally don't think it was worth the $166.88 when it pertains to personal safety.\n\nDo think out of all the casino hotels in the valley Talking Stick Resort is the best as well as being close to all the ammenities in Scottsdale.  \n\n\n  Leonard W Payne\n  Reservation Number #095468391
4 ||| Nice Nursery, Fantastic Bonsai!  For Charlotte these are the Bonsai and Orchid Specialists!  You can find Bonsai Works of Living Art!\n\nBonsai: Tools, Wire, Potting Mixture, Containers and  Beautiful Trees in Dishes Ready to go!  Helpful staff too!
3 ||| The Food has always been very good and the servers are very nice. Food is always piping hot when served. They keep your drinks topped. My family has been a customer of Macayo's for 30 years and just love it.
2 ||| The pricing & food is ok.  Their strong suit is that they're open to 3 am.  I really don't know why they're often crowded, especially for lunch on the weekend.  I come here mainly to people watch & because they're walking distance from my place.
0 ||| Stopped by this place during a recent Vegas trip after a few local cigar guys told me about it (they said it had a nice lounge)\n\nFirst, I am a person that travels with cigars, in part because I like good cigars, but I don't like to pay tourist trap prices.  But you don't walk into a cigar shop to smoke and not buy something, that's just bad form.\n\nThe humidor is tiny, about half of it is their custom rolled, the prices are higher than they should be (not Casa high, but more than MSRP and NV tax)\n\nWhat really got to me was they were filming something, and kept telling people sitting in the lounge that we needed to keep quiet so they wouldn't hear us on the tape.  When they stopped filming, the production staff was calling women to come in to be part of the crowd shots.\nA cigar lounge where they don't want you to talk?  Cigars are social, a lounge that you can't sit down and strike up a conversation with the other people around you?  Not a place I will go back to
4 ||| This facility is really amazing. It's clean, gives each animal ample space to move about, symphony music is piped in over the speakers (soothing to animals), and adoption fees are reasonable. They keep excellent medical records on each animal that comes through their system. \nI'm big on adoption. It is so, so important to me that families who want to consider having a pet should give the Humane Society a try before going anywhere else. Sure, puppies are cute for a few months, but they need training. Adult dogs have already been housebroken, many know tricks and words, and they appreciate and love you that much more, remembering where they came from and knowing your home will be their best ever.
3 ||| It is so nice to stumble across a gem like this.   A darling restaurant in an cozy old house in Phoenix.   Art on the wall to enjoy and purchase if interested.    The food is fantastic.   My husband ordered the pork tacos.  There were four tacos on the plate and the meat was deliciously tender and the tacos came with a small side salad.  I ordered the caprese salad and this salad came with the best dressing ever.  I would love to have the recipe.  The menu said that it was lemon en-fused olive oil, basalmic reduction....best caprese salad ever.   For dessert we shared the coconut cream pie.   Oh my.....perfect crust and filling.  Heavenly meal.  Thank You.  If you live near by and haven't given the Coronado cafe a try you are missing out.
2 ||| Ok, I admit, I am not a sports bar person.  Heck, I am not so much of a sports person.  But I am a huge fan of wings, and thus I sought out a place that had pretty decent ones.  This led me to try Picasso's to see what it's all about.  And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.\n\nThus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.  \n\nI have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.\n\nService has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.\n\nI plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.  Their wings are good, but I must continue on my quest for amazing wings here in Charlotte.\n\nOverall, I would give Picasso's about 3.5 stars.
2 ||| I've been to Coup Des Tartes twice now.  The inside of the restaurant is just as charming as everyone says.  I think the food is pretty good.  The onion tart is one of my favorite menu items.  I've had it both times I've gone.  I also love the BYOB option, and I think the $10 corking fee is pretty fair.  \n\nI have a huge problem with the price of the menu items.  $26 for pork tenderloin? And even though I like the onion tart...$12? I'd go back for the appetizers, but I don't think I'd be back if I had to spend close to $100 for the meal.
0 ||| Do not go here. Horrible costumer service. Return policy from the dark ages...even on unopened nonpersonal item bought just hours before. Surprised they think that they can still treat people this way when there are so many other wonderful options.
1 ||| We had a great night here last night for our anniversary and we brought our 23 year old son from Los Angeles to celebrate with us. We loved our night, but that was mostly because we were with this young guy who we don't get to see very often. The white bean soup had very few white beans and was basically an overly-salty italian soup. The filets were delicious but extremely overpriced as was the pork tenderloin. The service was great, and they brought a few strawberries and some whipped cream as an anniversary treat for us. \n\nWe like Coup des Tartes but the only time we can afford going here is when they offer a Groupon or some discount. Honestly, the prices on their regular menu are just sky high. It's very disconcerting when you first walk in and look at the menu. I hate to see another restaurant that we enjoy being converted to another one of those places that ONLY works when you have a Groupon in hand. \n\nI'd like to suggest to the owners of Coup des Tartes that they take a serious look at the menu pricing and cut it back a bit. Stop with the Groupons and focus on providing a value and we'll be there once a week.\n\nReview Updated on 8/7/2012:\n\nWow, did we have a disaster with this restaurant. I originally gave it a three star rating. I think their food does still merit a 3 star, but I am going to downgrade them one notch for the way I was treated the other day.\n\nWe had a Groupon (yes, they still focus on those promos) and it was going to expire in five or six days. We left a message early AM for a reservation for that night, and then never had a returned call. That was the first bad sign. When we called back and spoke to the owner, the guy was rude and just plain nasty. No, they had no reservations that night, and the other nights we suggested (mid-week) they couldn't get us in before 9 or 9:30 and so on . . .  Later, I called Groupon and asked what they suggest. They told me that as long as you make your reservation before the cut off date, the restaurant will still honor your full value of the Groupon on the date you go in, even though it is after expiration. I called and unfortunately the same guy got on the line. \"No way\" he replied - \"That's not how we work Groupons. You only get half the value - the amount you paid.\" So I put him on the line with the Groupon rep, who told us both that the guy has to honor the Groupon. Well, he opted not to do so and hung up. Honestly, this restaurant is cute and the food's not bad, but with an owner like this, why patronize them? On Saturday, when we could have been in there arguing with this fellow over our bill, we chose to have dinner at Durant's. Now THAT is a 5 star romantic restaurant. Please, avoid places like this where management is not on your side, the customer.
0 ||| Had a terrible experience here with a group of friends and the food definitely isn't nearly good enough to make up for it (decent at the best of times).\n\nA number of us went to Ginza hoping to get the sushi happy hour. The staff asked if we wanted to be seated in a tea room and we said why not. We didn't find out until we got our bill  that that meant we didn't get half price sushi anymore. We talked to the hostess and then the manager and not only did no one offer anyone any kind of refund, they wouldn't even give an apology or admit any degree of fault in the situation. By the end of the ordeal, all we wanted was someone to say 'Sorry, we should have been more up front about not getting the discount in the tea room' or even (for maximum responsibility-dodging) 'Thanks for the suggestion, in the future we'll mention that  the tea room doesn't qualify for the discount.'
0 ||| I'm not quite sure exactly how I feel about this place. I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great, the decor was very nice, but the service and the food, not so much.\n\nFirst we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience. \n\nWe were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope. \n\nFirst the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down.\n\nTo make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato? You have got to be kidding me.  \n\nI spent almost $200 and left disappointed, that should never happen.
1 ||| It seems like every mid-size city or bigger has a discount movie theater; and those that don't, definitely should. I've got no beef with the infrastructure or staff at Market Square: the employees seem friendly enough, and the theaters have more charm than your typical mall 16-plex. However, the movie selection at this place is lousy. They always seem to be playing the crappiest crap that was in the mall theaters several months ago, rather than some good Sundance cast-offs or independent films. Even worse, a lot of the movies are parked here for weeks or months on end. I've literally been waiting since the start of the summer for Market Square to show something worthwhile, to no avail. What good is a discount theater with character and reasonable concessions if they're never showing anything you'd want to see??? I'm surprised \"Gigli\" isn't still playing here ...
4 ||| Best wings in Charlotte!  I'm originally from Upstate NY so my family often comes to visit and the FIRST stop on my Dad's list is Wing King to get his favorite Honey Hot wings!
3 ||| Mmm I have been going to Tokyo Sushi since I was a wee little one! They were Japanese owned before but now are owned by a nice Korean family! What I love about this place is that they hook it up with a lot of free service items especially if you are a returning guest or if you order a lot of food. I'm not a big fan of the rolls here but some of my MUST HAVES are the fresh live sweet shrimp (ama ebi) sashimi or nigiri, Sea Urchin (Uni) Nigiri & salmon skin handroll! Omg so good & so fresh! \n\nTip: They also do live halibut sashimi Korean style with all the fixings!
1 ||| Gotta love it when a \"trendy, hipster\" restaurant uses canned products. Canned corn, canned refried beans, canned jalepenos...not worth the money for these kinds of products... Stale chips, average tacos (we had blackened mahi mahi) and over priced beers. 5 bucks for a draught beer? Come on now!! My wife and I have eaten here several times and have tried various items on the menu. We always seem to be disappointed after eating here. And before we get reamed and told to stay in, we normally do\nThe wait staff is awesome and attentive to the patrons...no problem here. Everyone is friendly and I think this is what brings us back for the most part....that and the fact we love the NoDa area. However the food is just average for us....
3 ||| Did not get to eat in as they were packed when lunch was catered at work their pita bread was nice and warm-delishus!
0 ||| Ew,  I recently moved to this area and this is now my local Dairy Queen.  Who knew you could mess up a Blizzard so bad?\n\nFirst of all, the line was out the door.  We assumed that it was just a busy night.  Turns out they were out of multiple items (and did not put a sign up). People were upset and walking out.  Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?  \n\nI get up to the counter and ask a question about the ingredients of a Brownie Batter blizzard.  They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!\n\nWe pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?\n\nWe get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.  And just walked away.  \n\nI walked out feeling very unsatisfied and my husband I determined this will be our last visit to the local DQ.  Besides the poor service, the food standards were disgusting.
1 ||| After hearing how terrific the food and atmosphere are at Tornado Club, I was eager to try it. I had the 8 oz filet and my girlfriend had the queen cut of prime rib on a recent Saturday night. Even though the restaurant is listed as wheelchair accessible, it was difficult to turn the sharp corner into the bar from the front door and if the bar is busy, it's nearly impossible to negotiate my large power wc between the vintage barstools and excessively large booths. Also, the well-worn marble in the doorway needs to be replaced--it forms a large, uneven surface which further complicates a difficult entryway for a wheelchair-using patron. My steak was good, if slightly undercooked from my medium request. The hash brown were greasy and overly cooked and my underwhelming barley mushroom soup was heavy on the former while the latter was nearly non-existant. My gf's prime rib was tasty, but the cut was particularly thin and excessively fatty compared with other restaurants in Madison. Overall, Smoky's still rules in my book and perhaps it's impossible for any steak house to live up to the kind of love the Tornado gets from it's devotees. It just didn't do it for me and Smoky's doesn't make you choose between soup or salad (both are included) and each include a relish tray and bread--for pretty much the same price. For me though, the flavor of my steak wasn't as good as Smoky's and it was disappointingly undercooked. I'm probably like most diners who don't go to the trouble to send it back, not wanting to wait or make a fuss.
0 ||| This restaurant came highly recommended so I was eager to check it out. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. \n\nFirst, the portion sizes are incredibly large, which you'd think would be great. However, they're SO large that it begs the question of how on earth they're able to afford to give out these portions for a relatively cheap price? We're talking fresh, raw fish, not American-style buffet. Bigger is not always better, especially when it comes to sushi. \n\nThe albacore was pretty tasty, I'll give it that. However, the rice was hot in the sushi and rolls!\n\nHot rice is disgusting!!!!!! So, so, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO gross and a huge turn off!!! It warms the fish to the point of it not tasting right. Also if you don't eat the rolls immediately, the entire thing changes its consistency because the hot rice is melding with the cold fish and other vegetables. There is nothing more disappointing and disgusting than unknowingly biting into a warmed piece of sushi with hot rice. \n\nThey also only had 2 sushi chefs in the very packed restaurant. The rolls came out sloppier than I'd make at home. The rice to fish ratio was totally off. There was so much fish in the rolls and so little rice you couldn't even fit the whole thing in your mouth. The rolls were literally falling apart from the moment the chef cut into them, mainly from the lack of tightness when being rolled. It looked like a total mess.\n\nSushi is just as much about the beautiful presentation and the flavor of the rice, as it is about the taste of the fish. Unfortunately this place had mediocre fish and horrible presentation...and hot rice, which tells me they're not willing to take the time (or care about their customers enough) to present fish properly.
1 ||| Called ahead on Saturday 3/15 to let them know 10 people would be coming to dinner at 8:15pm.  Person on the phone said they do not take reservations. I said I just thought you might like to know if 10 people are coming. She said she would let someone know.\nShow up, hostess was shocked. They put a table together and our server did a good job making sure everyone had what they needed and did separate checks which was above and beyond.\nHere's the real reason for this review and I hope someone who has any say in what goes on there gets this message. The lentil fattoush had so much garlic in it, it could have killed a horse. I took 3-4 bites and had dragon's breath immediately. This has always been my favorite dish at PJ, but wow. Yuck. Ruined it for me. \nNo goodbye or thank you as the hostess at the podium was on her cell phone as we were all walking out. \nPita Jungle on Ray. Meh.
1 ||| Really comfortable atmosphere and welcoming staff. \nWhy only 2 stars? I expected better in terms of food and prices. We got the spinach and artichoke dip app and it was good but far too small for the $7-8 price. Definitely not worth that much--one could get double the portion and the same taste at Applebee's for the same price.\n\nThe Mac and cheese was super expensive and lackluster. I've had Mac and cheese at many different places and this was the worst. It wasn't thick, hardly any flavor, and just bland. \nThe garden weasel was alright and the fries were standard. \n\nLikely won't be visiting here again.
1 ||| Cheesy island decor. Loud top 40. Lots of people. Good for the just turned 21 crowd.
0 ||| My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for a long time. The food was great and the service was great! Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student, they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right? Their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable. We will not be coming back at all. There are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction.
3 ||| We eat here a couple of time a month, the food is always good and the service is good.  The lunch prices are great for a sit-down.
3 ||| I finally got around to renewing my Costco membership and went today for the first time in a long time. I had forgotten how much I love the selection of items at Costco.  $5.99 lb for organic chicken breast, versus $8.99 lb at HT!  Wow! Great deals on all natural laundry detergent & all natural dish detergent too!  The only negative for me that there is no Costco in the Ballantyne area... but I love it so much that I will just have to leave \"the bubble\" to make the trek to Costco.  Oh, and I just ordered an item at costco.com and the price listed online included shipping so I can get some items delivered straight to my front-door.  (Great for lazy people like me.)
0 ||| I am only giving this place a one star rating because I have to give something. I would actually give this place zero stars. One time I went in there to sell some books. A library book accidentally got placed in the pile of books to sell. I did not realize it and neither did the employee until later that night. Instead of calling me, the bookstore called the library and told them I was trying to sell their books. The library actually tried to press charges on me for this. I did not know that anything was even going on until a police officer showed up at my door and inquired about the incident. I told him I had no idea there was a problem because the bookstore never called me. \n I went up to the bookstore to clear it up and to let them know it was just a mistake. I never meant to try and sell a library book. The manager of the bookstore, I think her name was Denise ( a skinny redhead) came up to me and asked me to sign a paper. When I asked her what it was, she told me that it was a form that explained if I ever came back on the bookstores property, I would be arrested for trespassing....WHAT?? It was an innocent mistake. I would never try and sell books that were not mine. I also am banned from the library because they apparently believed the story that the bookstore told them. I tried to talk with the head librarian and she wanted to know why it took me so long to come see her if it was all an accident. I tried to explain to her that the bookstore never called me to inform me of the mix up. I did not know about it for weeks afterwards when a police officer came to my house.\n If you are going to sell books to this store, please check and double check that the books are yours to sell. This place apparently believes accidents to do not happen. I have warned all my friends and family about this place and nobody I know will shop there again.
1 ||| Just okay.  I had a pedicure and the water was on the colder side.  The pedicure and gel nail polish was $40 dollars.  I had better & less expensive elsewhere.
2 ||| I am pleased with Brueggers.  Quick and inexpensive food that you can eat if there is nothing else you are tasting.  I need those \"fall-back\" places for times that I am ambivalent to the world.  Today, we ordered the following items:\n\nButternut squash soup\nChicken spaetzle soup\nHam egg and cheddar on toasted onion bagel\nChicken chipotle club on toasted onion bagel minus lettuce (use the Turkey Chipotle Club as a base)\n\nBeing from Florida, the soups were a hot welcome -- I was SO cold today.  The chicken spaetzle soup -- think chicken noodle with the noodles replaced with dumplings -- was rather good.  It wasn't too salty and the spaetzle wasn't mushy.  I wouldn't rave about the flavor of the broth, but I enjoyed what I ate.  The butternut squash soup, while lumpy and stringy, had a nice flavor with a slight piquancy to it.  It is amazing that the butternut squash soup can taste better at Bruegger's than at Season 52.  \n\nSince I am picky and finicky about what I eat, I special ordered my chicken bagel-wich.  It took a little bit longer to make, but I am used to that -- it's a special order, what do you expect.  The staff was up to the task and were all blunt and to the point with everything they said; my kind of people.  \n\nBy no means gourmet, the bagel-wiches still had good flavor.  There was no undue piquancy in the chipotle, just some flavor to compliment the chicken and the tomato.  The addition of the toasted onion bagel was nice.  The ham, egg, and cheddar was average; but for being in downtown Pittsburgh -- and unable to make it home -- it is a passable substitute.  \n\nI will definitely return.
0 ||| I landed at the Pittsburgh airport, and after waiting over a half hour in the cold for a hotel shuttle, decided it best to take a cab.  I entered cab #529 and had driver #6149.\n\nOnce in the backseat, the driver asked where to.  She sped off, with me in the backseat giving her the hotel address. She plugged the address into her Garmin navigation and then freaked out.  All hell rained down on me.  She told me that I should be taking the \"hotel shuttle\" and that this cab ride was costing her time and money.  She told me had she known I was not going downtown, she never would have allowed me in the cab.  Not wanting to be dumped off the side of the highway on a cold, snowy night,  I apologized.  THIS WAS THE CABBIE FROM HELL.  Must avoid.  Me also thinks what she tried to do, telling me I should \"put money\" on this, was probably illegal.
2 ||| Safeway is my go to grocery store. \n\nIts always clean, everything is easy to find. The staff is always friendly. \n\nI highly enjoy some of their name brand items. When I am feeling lazy and don't want to make my own pasta sauce, Safeway is always my go to! They have lots of great choices that are all yummy! \n\nThings that made me give it only 3 stars: \n\nThis location doesn't have a meat or seafood counter. I like it when I have questions about a certain meat or fish, that someone is right there, also from time to time I have a need to pick out my meat from the case vs pre packaged, this is not an option here. They do have a button you can push and someone will eventually come out...but yeah \n\nI was in there a few months ago looking for polenta. I asked a girl who came down the aisle. She didn't know, but said she would find out. The person she asked didn't even know what polenta was. Very very frustrating. I now know to go to Sprouts or Fresh and Easy for my polenta needs. \n\nAlso they don't carry Orrichetta pasta...once again I had to go to Sprouts for that.
1 ||| When drinking, strip clubs sound great don't they? This one was down the street so i went. On a Friday night i expected it to be busy, it wasn't. It also didn't have the best talent walking around either. \nThe girl on the stage looked intoxicated and didn't really do, much. She shimmed a bit. Now i'm a girl btw. So I'm no perv. But i could have done better up there. \nI did convince two girls two smile, helped one with her bra and made one girl's night by buying the horrible drink she recommended, Vodka tonic. A lap dance later from a busty at the seams woman named Daisy (yep i'll called her out) I wanted to drink somewhere else. Luckily I made it out with no viral diseases..
3 ||| I had the spicy schezuan noodle bowl and it was great.
2 ||| I stayed here over a weekend last summer.  The room was nothing special- pretty typical stuff. I loved the style of the atrium.  There is a bar in the lobby but prepare to be ripped off.  Not much else to do in walking distance.  Parking is across the street.
2 ||| Nice place comfortable, friendly employees, used a groupon great price  fir a55  minute  Swedish  Massage  and  Pedicure. Enjoyed our time there in Vegas as well.  My daughter and I bought the same package but once we left and talked about our experiences we both realized we both received totally different packages even tho we paid the same price  with a groupon. I don't think this should have happened at all. So I was a little bummed sounded like my daughter had the better experience. It was her birthday surprise so I'm glad for her. Probably won't return anytime soon for that reason. Good luck with your 60 min Swedish Massage and Pedicure.
1 ||| We have eaten here more than 30 times over the past few years since it's close.  The service has gone downhill.  Even with the recent \"makeover\", they have messed up the order, after already taking almost 20 minutes to even wait on us.  We always try to give them the benefit of the doubt cuz the food is usually pretty good.  Biggest thing-- be prepared to more than likely be there for over an hour by the time everything is said and done. I'm sure it doesn't happen all the time... but has happen more than half the time with us. =(
3 ||| Fish tacos are so good after midnight. Maybe cos I'm dying of hunger?
1 ||| Snobby and pretentious. drinks are very weak. Too loud to hear anything. Floor is very slippery. Unfriendly doorman. not a fan, at all.\n\nJoes has a better dance floor. Firehaus has more class.
0 ||| I took a $228 pair of Citizens for Humanity jeans in to K-Family to be hemmed. Despite the obvious quality of the garment and my expressed concern about the stylized appearance of the jean that would be compromised by the hem, they handled the job carelessly, hemming and rehemming it too short -- two times -- and leaving the messy stitching where it had been artful. I feel sick. You get what you pay for here, a quick job, no art.
4 ||| I have been going to Silver Touch for the past seven years (it used to be Weiss Guys Car Wash). Over the past seven years I have never found anything to complain about. The washes are reasonably priced (about $10 for a vacuum and wash or $6 for a wash while you wait in your car), and my car always looks great afterward.\n\nI absolutely HAVE to mention my last visit here, because I received amazing service. I scraped my car on a pole and had a significant amount of yellow paint transfer on my silver car. I took it in to Silver Touch, and they took the paint off IMMEDIATELY upon my arrival and charged me nothing. Of course I tipped the guy a $20 for his work in the hot sun, but you really can't beat that! (I should also mention that my dad received the same treatment when he took my sister's car in about a year prior to my  visit).\n\nAs far as the standard car wash goes, I have no complaints. The detail work they do at the end is always done exceptionally well. I have had a couple instances when some of the dirt or grease on my car hasn't come off during the car wash cycle, but they happily remove it when asked. For the most part, these people are soooo busy getting cars in and out as quickly as possible, that that they may miss a small area on the car every once in a while. They're only human and it happens... Here's a tip - instead of complaining about the car wash after leaving, tell them politely that they missed a spot! They are more than happy to help you, trust me!\n\nI absolutely love this place and will continue to get my car washed, detailed, and shampooed here for many years to come!
3 ||| On the whole, Pane Bianco was worth the trip. I highly recommend that you get there via the brand-spanking-new Phoenix Light Rail (Campbell & Central Ave stop)!\n\nAmazing fresh bread from a glorious oven.I arrived just before 2PM and they had just changed the market sandwich ($10- yikes!) I chose the no-mayo tuna. Good tasting and moist, but not great. For an $8 sandwich, I'd have liked a bit more tuna. \n\nThe picnic table seating outdoors next to the street and the railroad tracks - really not so great in the middle of a warm afternoon. \n\nAfter savoring my lunch, I did go to Lux and was extremely happy to cool down with an iced espresso. The ice and the caffeine picked me up I before heading back to a conference in downtown Phoenix.
4 ||| The burgers are cooked magnificently, and the master chefs have a way with the salads that can't just be beat. I also thank them for posting that sauces cost 10 cents extra - most other McDonalds don't have signage saying sauces cost extra. They often close early on weekends to give staff members extra family time.
3 ||| Wary of a place where I can order alfredo pasta, burgers, carne asada burritos, and cheesecake from the same place - was this to be a jack of all trades and master of none?\n\nKudos on the burgers being cooked to order, where you can specify from rare to well-done. I'm a medium-rare and he's a medium, and they were accurately cooked.\n\nThe burger meat was a little bland, and it seems like they use a frozen beef patty based on the shape. They offer a lot of ways to dress it up to make up for this. We got a fried egg on one, and sauteed mushrooms on the other.\n\nVeggies were crisp, bun was buttered and soft. \n\nFries were salty and tasted best when completely coated in ketchup. \n\nPickle was dill-icious, which is a joke I'm pretty sure has never been told before.\n\nMy guy's fruit punch was completely watered down by the time it arrived. I would recommend getting all drinks no ice and adding ice when you're ready to enjoy the drinks.\n\nAlso, ordered an iced coffee. Standard, passable coffee. Pretty cool that it's delivered.\n\nBottom line: Menu is expansive. Burger and fries were average. Delivery is fairly priced and quick.
4 ||| We were in Chandler just for the day and checked yelp for a good place to have Mexican food and saw the review on Abuelo's and chose it.  It was great! We would go there again next time in town, highly recommend it , good service, good food, good price.
4 ||| The return of Sweet Tomatoes!\n\nThere isn't much more I can say than what has already been said in other reviews.  Yes, the Field Kitchen experiment has failed and Sweet Tomatoes has gone back to its old format.  Even better, with the renovation and cool new soda machine and utensils, it's better than ever.  Before the Field Kitchen phase, I was just ho-hum about this place.  Now, it's a place with such good-tasting food that I want to return on a frequent basis.\n\nThe only bad thing is that the soda machine has one spigot for over 100 flavors.  If you want a drink, you are going to need to get in line.  Apart from that, this place is primo now.\n\nMy family and I aren't the only ones happy to see this place back and better-- when we visited recently, it was PACKED.  Lots of veggie options only sweeten the deal here.  Pile on your plates and chow down!
4 ||| Sometimes, you just want fried chicken. And you don't want to get it at the fast food joint. When that craving strikes you, give La'Wan's a shot.\n\nWhile the ordering situation was initially confusing... do I seat myself? do I order at the counter? ... it straightened out quickly. Yes, seat yourself. Yes, someone will bring a menu and take your drink order. There's also a buffet table, but I skipped that today.\n\nA few minutes later, I had a quarter of white meat chicken set down in front of me. The chicken was really excellent. Lots of meat, not a lot of batter, not too greasy at all. The mac & cheese lived up to the sign out front (\"Best in the Queen City\") with lots of cheesiness inside and a good topping of toasted cheese. Maybe not as good as *my* mac & cheese, but certainly some of the best that I've had away from my own kitchen. The cole slaw had the right consistency and texture, but I found the pickle relish taste to be overpowering. No worries, to each his own.\n\nService was excellent. My water was refilled as needed, I was checked on as needed and there was a squeezy bottle of Texas Pete on the table for some bite.\n\nReally good chicken and great service. Yum!
1 ||| Time has not been kind to Flavors of India.  I just went back for dinner after a couple of years of inadvertently overlooking this place.  It appears that the management has changed and FOI is not better for it.\n\nPerhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with \"free\" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?  They need to change the name of this place to Nickel and Dime.       \n\nFarewell, Flavors of India, farewell!
1 ||| Not impressed with this location. The inside was dark, dingy, and in desperate need of an update. The locker room floor was wet (more than what's typical and not near the showers) and many of the lockers with built-in locks didn't work. The equipment was ok, though it took me a few tries to find a treadmill that didn't have broken parts. The cardio area (floor mats, stretching, exercise balls) was small and difficult not to run into people. Also, our membership was expiring soon and upon checking in, got a sales pitch about signing up again and had to talk to staff to get our check in approved. There were male staff cleaning the women's locker room so I had to hurry to get my stuff and change before the cleaning. Is it not possible to find female staff for the ladies locker room?\n\nI've been to some lovely 24 hour fitness locations, but this one could use some help. Though the reason for not renewing my membership is primarily because the town we currently live in does not have a 24 hour fitness location, I think I'll stick with Gold's in the future.
0 ||| Terrible place don't recommended it at all especially if you have kids because they might get you kicked out for being too loud and walking too heavy footed! Apparently they got complaints of us walking too hard and waited until 11pm Arizona time to tell us and ask us to leave! Mind you were from out of state and are use to a different time and I have a 7 and 3 year old. They said if we didn't go to sleep they'd come and make us leave and not give us a refund! I know when my kids are being too loud and believe me it was nowhere near loud! God forbid I have a newborn baby who wouldn't stop crying in this place! If you expect peace and quiet people underneath us you should have spent more money on a better hotel! And that one star was only because the page wouldn't let me leave a review if I didn't put one! No star at all!
2 ||| Paisan's exterior, overlooking Lake Monona, may look romantic. But do not be fooled, dear readers. The interior lacks charm, and has sort of a generic, hotel-ish quality, besides maybe the cool, pine wood shelving that enables those at the bar to tell exactly what the offerings of alcohol are. This is a nice, clear lay-out as opposed to the standard clustering of bottles.   \n\nHowever, I was a-okay with the food. It's good, stick to your ribs type of stuff. I had the beef noodle soup and it was perfect to warm me up on a winter day. I also enjoyed the spinach fettucini with chicken tettrazini in a light, yet not doused white cheese sauce. The college-aged guy that served us was pleasant and attentive enough.\n\nOne thing that could be improved though definitely are the plates. They reminded me of, like, old-school airplane ones with the silver lining. A little bit of the pasta was also burnt and crunchy...like cooked too much in an oven or something? \n\nI would return because in comparison to the other Madison offerings, it's a little better than average. It's more like three and a half stars.
2 ||| Descriptive phrase: quaint, local diner.\n\nMonty's Blue Plate Diner is located in a quiet but neat part of East Madison, not far off Willy Street. It looks like an old gas station (could be), and there was a 25 minute wait for Saturday brunch when we came. There's space to sit outside, or shops nearby to wander to. Inside it's classic diner, through and through. We (4 of us) were seated at a small booth. It was cozy to say the least. \n\nKatie K. and I split a Chocolate Shake ($6) to start off. It's what you'd expect from the setting, served in a metal tin and absolutely delicious. I as good as chugged mine.\n\nI leaned toward lunch this time around and got the Roast Chicken, Bacon & Goat Cheese sandwich ($9). This dish was just missing a wow-factor (in addition to the Oxford-comma). I love goat cheese, and expected so much with it melted between two pieces of sourdough and chicken, bacon, and tomato. But none of the flavors that should've been present stood out. The salty bacon was lost in the grease of the bread. There may not have been any tomato. The chicken was bland.\n\nI loved the shake, and the sandwich was by no means bad, but there was no warm-feeling deliciousness I expected from a meal in such a diner. I'd return, but get something else.
1 ||| I was looking for a new sushi spot, but was somewhat disappointed with the experience. First, I was the only customer, during my entire dining experience..which somewhat scares me. I was seated and served a complimentary salad. The salad was good, but overdressed..crazy overdressed. I ordered the onion soup and egg rolls. The onion soup was basically broth with a few onions, but no real onion flavor, which is what I was hoping for. As for the egg rolls, can I say frozen.\nOnto the sushi. I chose a roll based on the waitresses recommendation, however it had a mango sauce that was so overwhelming I sent it back. I was not offered anything else and was charged for the roll, $13.95, after eating only two pieces. I questioned the server about being charged and she expressed the fact she told me what I was getting and I ordered it. Whoa, was I surprised. I expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do. She disappeared and came out with an older women. Upon returning to my table she did remove the roll, but was very unpleasant about it. \nAlthough I appreciate the fact they removed the roll, but was not impressed otherwise and will stick to my other favorites.
4 ||| Great menu and service is fantastic. Lunch at noon with five of us took less than hour and portions. I will make this my new go to lunch spot with clients and friends alike.
0 ||| It opens 24/7 meaning they don't have any down time to CLEAN and to train their staff. What I saw was poor service and dirty tables, as far as the food, Pho was served cold and the broth was made in a hurry for a quick serve.  Here is my suggestion to the managers there, if the food is not ready to serve then do NOT serve it, simply let the customers know, everyone understands that.  Our pho took nearly 25 minutes to come and the waiter was extremely RUDE.  My family for sure won't return here and my guess is that all the reviews on yelp are being paid for.  Not even a 1 star.
3 ||| First time to Oregano's.  We'll be back.  Extensive menu.   We chose pizza and it was delish!   Music a little too loud but we'll definitely go back.
0 ||| I wish I could rate this place higher, if only because they have a pretty good beer selection.  They carry Atwater Vanilla Java Porter, which should earn them two stars, in and of itself!  It's like tiramisu in beer form, people.\n\nBut unfortunately for Mr. (or Ms.?) Kazansky, and more unfortunately for me, after I ate there, I became bazooka-barf sick.  I mean like sea-cucumber, insides-on-the-outsides sick.  \n\nI had noticed that the slices of brisket looked a little strange (Green? Iridescent? Possibly FLUORESCENT?!), and even brought it to the attention of the waitress, who acted as though I was asking her if the Pope was Jewish.  (Of course not!  No no, that's fresh!  Every day!)\n\nBob and I walked home with me sweating and pausing to regain my equilibrium.  Thankfully for us and for the random residents of Squirrel Hill, I made it home and straight to the bathroom without incident.
2 ||| We live close by and wanted to check this place out. Nothing was overly amazing but the food was decent. Decor is your typical Tuscan style and the wood fire oven is interesting to watch. \n\nI had one of the veal dishes which reminded me a lot of Chicken Marsala and cost $28. There was no sides, salad and even bread to go with the meal but the size of my portion was ok. The only issue I had,  besides the high cost, was that my meal had no surprises.  It was a very simple dish and for $28 I would expect something more complex. The sauce was everywhere, overpowering the cheese, procuito and mushrooms and there was nothing to counter it. A vegetable or anything would have improved the meal and helped me get through the overwhelming taste of the sauce.  \n\nMy husband had the lasagna which was very good but cost $19 and I know it did not fill him up. Again it was simple in design and we were expecting something more coming from an Italian background.  Maybe my family is full of over-achievers, so my opinion may be harsh but for the type of food they are creating the price is outrageous. \n\nIf prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt. Lebanon. For the same amout you would be better of going next door to Bistro 19, one of the upscale restaurants in the area. In my opinion they have a far better menu, it is creative,  hearty and the atmosphere is trendy. We went there this summer and I loved everything about the place. Even though its on the expensive side, Bistro 19 is definitely worth it.
1 ||| I really WANTED to like this place! But unfortunately it just wasn't possible given our experience here... :(\n\nEXTERIOR: 1.5 (strip mall)\n\nINTERIOR: 4\n\nFOOD TASTE: 5\n\nFOOD PRICE: 2.5\n\nFOOD QUANTITY: 2\n\nSERVICE: -1\n\n... So the two best things going for this restaurant are definitelty the cool looking interior (which isn't *that* amazing, but I still like it a lot) and the taste of the food which I must say is quite good...\n\nA big downside is the prices being high for less than desirable amounts of food.\n\nObviously the things I was least a fan of was the service. Our waitress didn't seem to care about how pleasant our experience was. She basically ignored requests we made and even overcharged us by a little.\n\nConclusion? Despite the yummy spice tuna roll and teriyaki salmon, I'll skip this place next time.
2 ||| I've only ate here once. I stopped here and ordered some takeout for my wife and I. She got the honey chicken combo and I got beef with broccoli. I was told 10 minutes but, it took 25 they were really busy so I kind of let it slide since I really wasn't in much of a rush. The pork eggrolls were pretty damn good and so were the fried dumplings. The beef broccoli was pretty good the broccoli tasted pretty fresh to me. The honey chicken on the other hand I had mixed feelings about. It was kind of a mess honestly. The chicken looked completely off it didn't really look like chicken some of the pieces looked like beef so I wasn't really fond of that my wife thought it was ok but ehhh....wasn't that amazing for me. On the other hand the prices there are pretty well priced. A good thing is for the people who only speak Spanish they got a girl there that speaks Spanish so she can help with that which is a BIG plus.\n\nAll in all, its an ok place stuff is pretty good for the price plus I found this place off of Yelp so I just followed suit and gave it a taste.
3 ||| The pizza is pretty good especially for the price and they serve a nice size too. My husband and I enjoy the thin crust; I would perfer it be a little more crispy but my husband thinks it's perfect as-is...just the right amount of cooked.\nThey have recently started mixing up the pizza selection by offering a monthly special which is pretty cool. All and all it's a good everyday pizza joint.
1 ||| Not a fan.\nThey had a karaoke night for a short time about a year or two ago, but every time the owner was in, the host had to turn the music down...almost to the point of not needing a microphone.\n\nif you want a quiet bar, don't have a karaoke night.\n\nI love dive bars, but this place was just seedy.
3 ||| I'm not too sure about why there are so many 5 star reviews about this place.  Yep, the sandwich is decent, and is definitely worth the money, however, this is far from the best hoagie or sub I've had.\n\nI got the 20 inch Turkey sub.  For 12.99 that's a phenomenal deal.  You definitely get the value for your money.\n\nHowever, when you break down each of the components, the sandwich itself is just average.  The turkey wasn't sliced turkey, but instead kind of like the same chopped up consistency you would find in a cheesesteak.  I have no issues with that, but the turkey was a bit dry.  \n\nThe bread is a very soft bread, with no crust whatsoever.  I'm spoiled by the great bread from the Northeast, where it has a nice crust on the outside and very chewy on the inside.  The bread here is still good, but I wouldn't call this a hoagie.\n\nAll in all, the sandwich itself is really average; it's the value that you get for your money that drives it up to 4 stars for my review.  It's a decent substitute, but no match for a real hoagie.
3 ||| So, overall, the food here I've had has been really good. I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.\n\nThey always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley.
4 ||| This store is under new ownership. They are very friendly. Changed opening to all  7 days, Monday - Saturday, 6am - 8pm and Sunday, 8am - 6pm.\n\nGreat prices and customer service is a lot better now.
4 ||| CASH ONLY\n\nGreat dive place.  Heart attack on a plate.  Lotsa of tasty greasy fattening food.  Loved the chicken bbq and the onion rings.  If you are into  Americana, this is the place for you.  Tip the guy that brings the food a little bit and ask for extra napkins.
2 ||| Not feeling like cooking or going out this past Friday night, my hubby & I decided to place an order with Delicious Deliveries. With an almost $9 delivery & convenience charge, we will just get our lazy asses up & carry out next time. Ok, on with the review... \n\nFor an app we ordered the soft pretzels (double order). For our entrees we ordered the top sirloin with cheese potatocakes, asparagus & a sourdough roll & the whiskey-apple glazed pork loin that came with mashed potatoes, roasted veggies & a buttermilk biscuit. Oh & as if he didn't have enough sides, my hubby also got a side of the organic corn. For dessert we ordered the seasonal pumpkin cream cheese pie. \n\nThe soft pretzels were so good! They forgot the dipping sauce but we just used yellow mustard & devoured the 2 HUGE pretzels. Hubby ate all of his sides 1st (except the roll that they forgot also) so he didn't have room for the steak, but loved all of his sides. My entree was just ok, it was pretty blah overall, the best part was the biscuit. The dessert was very good & a HUGE portion (I think that's the theme for this restaurant). \n\nTotal (with tip & stupid delivery charges) was about $73, pretty steep for just an ok meal. Glad I tried it but I'm not in any rush to come back.
0 ||| The pizza reminded me of that \"pizza\" you had in middle school... That bad!
3 ||| I usually order from the small plate menu but decided to go with a shrimp pasta dish the last time I was there. Unfortunately it wasn't great, or good, only blah. Too little shrimp and way too much pasta. The flavor was bland, so bland that I had to constantly pepper each bite. I'm going to stick with what I enjoy best, the small plates.
1 ||| The place was deserted...there were maybe 15 rooms rented.  Still the front desk didn't seek to acknowledge people.  They were helpful to me, but another guest came up and said he didn't get an answer when he called room service, and he was directed to go to the lounge to order.  Didn't seem like a great response to me.  The outdoor pool and jacuzzi were dirty.  Ashtrays in the outside smoking areas were not emptied during our 3 days there.  The beds were very comfy.  The coffee for the coffee maker was not refilled.  I didn't even know there was  breakfast buffet.  It was ok for the cheap price I paid on a discount site.
1 ||| The places I hate most in this world are those that can't figure out what they want to be.  Coach and Willies is the epitome of this syndrome.\n\nWe came here for a meal, some drinks and to watch March Madness.  Boy what a mistake.  Being near the stadiums, I figured this place for a low rent, liquor up before the game place.  I should have done my research. This place desperately wants to upscale.  From the prices to the menu, it screams 'Look! Aren't we above the fray?' Well you know what, places above the fray don't have 87 TVs tuned to sports.  They also don't have a waitstaff that approaches you with a 'What's up yo?'  They also don't have facial tattoos.\n\nBut I was alright with delineation of style initially as the pizzas were half off.  But of course they were doughy and meh.  Well at least the games were on and the audio was being pumped in through the bar's speakers.  Oh wait, at 7 they turned down the lights and changed to some crappy R+B radio station. I guess that crowd who was coming in to get their 5 course wine and food pairings didn't want to listen to the game.  Why exactly they came to Coach and Willies then, I'll never know.
4 ||| It's not Greek to me, because this place makes perfect sense!\n\nThe people that own it are so sweet and make the best food.\n\nEvery time I go there, I stuff myself until I want to die. And then I spend several sleepless nights sweaty and anxious until I can eat their food again. I went from not liking humus to a humus-based diet after eating here. \n\nBut do not ask for their recipes! Trust me, they know their food is made with magic and they are not sharing -- a bottle of wine and I tried to get it out of them once unsuccessfully.
3 ||| Quick Work, local business, Mike the owner was honest and to the point and replaced our blower motor for AC lickety split for this upcoming HOT weekend-got us our vehicle back the same afternoon.
3 ||| The name of this place is deceiving: it sounds like it's a dive bar, but their goal is to be a nice restaurant. I've been here for lunch and have enjoyed the majority of the dishes I've tried and the service has always been better than average. The place feels cramped no matter where you sit and it gets pretty noisy when it's full. Expect to pay a lot for lunch, but the portions are fairly large depending on what you order, so here's a tip: you can split a dish with someone and they'll bring it out on two plates for you. This makes it more reasonable and you still won't leave hungry.
4 ||| Giving out another 5 star rating in just over week....what has come over me. Well I had to give Stewart and his guys five stars because the service and price was outstanding.\n\nDriving 35 minutes to Gilbert......a little gas\n\nPrice for 2 windows and a strip for my windshield......47.00 thanks to a great Groupon deal\n\nGetting there at 8:00am and leaving at 8:25 am.....PRICELESS\n\nI mean what else can I say....if you need window tinting....and if you live in AZ you definitely do....then run don't want to A BETTER TINT.....you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!
2 ||| All you can eat for $16.99 including bean soup and steamed egg, good bargain for Las Vegas. Place is kinda dirty, and service is poor depending on who is waitering. \nLike many asian places, this place also recycles food, so if you have untouched side dishes, rest assure, it won't be wasted here, it will\nbe served to someone else!
0 ||| I eat here at least twice a week but there are some new people here that just don't get customer service. I had to walk out one day after 15 minutes and nobody acknowledge me or offer me coffee. I won't be back for a while.
1 ||| Mineo's was the first great pizza place in the Squirrel Hill area...now it's mighty questionable.  I agree completely with Hasina D., when I was growing up in Pittsburgh, this place was 10 stars...as I got older, I realized the cheese was way too salty and generally too greasy (as other reviews have noted).  By the time I was a senior in high school, I stopped going here.  Suddenly all of the old smiling staff was gone and hired in their place was a bunch guys who you wouldn't want to turn down a dark alley way and run into.\n\nI will sum up a lot of the same complaints that other reviews have also pointed out:\n\n- Salty/greasy cheese\n- Dirty tables/floor/kitchen\n- Very poor service & attitude\n\nHere's how I'll put it...Would you want to go to the dirty, poorly lit and rude pizza place or the bright, recently renovated, clean place up the block?\n\nAnd the correct answer is: Go to Aiello's instead...it's right up the block.
4 ||| Great good great service. We took are 3 young children there tonight. The customer service was top notch.Waitress help led my children there steak while by wife was busy with our 1 old. Manager came over a few times to entertain them. It just made eating out with the kids more enjoyable
0 ||| There were 2 associates working tonight and a line of 4-5 people.  One associate was assisting a customer with a ridiculous amount of chit chat.  At one point I thought I overheard them talking about cats and flags.  Although I do appreciate her assisting someone else, she also began to write down step by step on a piece of paper on how to do something in Photoshop, really?  What happen to Google or even typing this information out to make things move along faster?  She literally stood there for 10 mins writing instructions on a piece of paper!  \n\n\nThe other associate finished assisting one customer and completely ignored the line, she stayed in her corner with her shipping boxes, I understand the importance of putting these boxes in order so they can be mailed out TOMORROW, but ignoring the line in front of you and NOT even greeting anyone is ridiculous to me.  What happen to good old customer service with a smile?  \n\nThese two associates were rude, slow, and ignored the line of customers in front of them.  I waited almost 20 minutes to print out my sheets!  I tried using their self service printing machine and the usb port was not working.  Never coming here again, overall horrid experience!
1 ||| Ghetto mexican food. Located in the shadiest of spots, it remains open 24/7\n\nfood is better if you are inebriated but otherwise still decent.\n\nNothing special mexican taco stand, food is kinda bland nothing too spicy. Pork was kinda tough, beff was stringy, chicken was dry.\n\nNo pico? WTF!! \n\nPlace looked like the person cleaning the dining room went to break right in the middle and left their stuff strung all over.\n\nI would avoid this place-really kinda shitty but hell it's a long ways before anything else if you live in this neighborhood. poor you.
4 ||| I love this salon. Vivian and Sally are amazing. They do a really great job and fast. They always fit me in same day. I am a perfectionist, and my nails look amazing. Eyebrows too ;)
2 ||| Good food but odd that they lost my lunch order. Thanks to those manning the counter who realized I was waiting and filled the order on the spot.
0 ||| Do you like waiting 30 minutes for fast food? If you do then this is your place! There is usually little veto no lines in this place but you will always have to wait for the simplest orders.  The cashiers are always screwing around on their phones which they have laying on the register in full view. \n\nThe place sucks.  Drive over the bridge and get chic film a because their service is much better and you don't have to hear employees swearing or using racial slurs.
0 ||| After waiting 45 minutes for a cab, our taxi (#69) left without us because we took over one minute to leave the restaurant. I learned my lesson, and will never take anyone other than Green Cab again. Union Taxi is a joke of a company, and I strongly discourage you from booking through them.
2 ||| Fun if you like after parties. However, it we got the most horrible service ever.
4 ||| we were in town for 3 nights and ended up eating here twice great bar food exactly what i expect, what more can a guy ask for!
4 ||| This is my daughter's 2nd year at ASA.  I appreciate the emails teachers send me regarding my daughter's progress or places that needs my attention.  I especially appreciate the lecture videos teacher created and the free tutoring time at lunch.  I am thankful my daughter study at ASA.
0 ||| My comment is directed at Bank of America in general. I had been banking with them for 15 years, with substantial lines of credit. Of course when times are good, they are your best friend. \nBut when times are tough, they dump you like a bad case of the flu!\n\nI know noone will care about this review! We all know the banks in general dont give a hoot about their clients. But at least I will feel better.\n\nOf course, that was years ago, and now I am getting back to maklng money - and now I have banks knocking at the door.\n\nBut I will always remember the treatment they gave - cutting credit lines, closing accounts and suspending credit. All the while while the feds bail them out!\n\nSo screw you Bank of America!
3 ||| Laser Quest.. A fun family friendly activity where shooting your friends is still ok and futuristic sounds and lights can make your head spin.\n\n  They have the same base price of 8.50 per game as most of the laser tag places in town with a current promotion of 3 games per person for 19.\n\nThey have 3 party rooms and some basic video games.\n\nYou get to choose your own name and assign it to your weapon yourself.\n\nThe course is not really identifiable as a specific place, it consists of ramps and obstacles with places to shoot from above, underneath, and the sides.  There are very few places to hide for long as even the floors expose you.\n\nThere is no viewing section so if you aren't playing, you don't get to see anything until the scores are posted.\n\nThere is only a vending machine, no actual over the counter drinks or food.\n\nMembership costs $10.00 and gets you some swag and a 2 dollar discount on every game.\n\nAll in all a fun time. Wish it had over the counter food and a viewing section but other than that, it scores.
2 ||| I guess you have to try this out if your not from Pittsburgh!\n\nI had the sweet sausage, Hubs had hot sausage, my oldest had ham and my youngest ordered chicken fingers.  The chilli was good, but the bread it came w/ was stale.  They put cole slaw and french fries on the sandwiches.  I thought that it just made the sandwiches bland and starchy.  But not bad...just blah.  The bread was nice and soft and they have several different kinds.  \nI am not a beer drinker, but they looked like pretty good prices.  The place was very crowded and you seat yourself.  We lucked up on an empty table, although it was by the door.  The place looks much bigger on the outside.
4 ||| Yea, I love a REAL Irish pub...\n\nThe folks are great the food is authentic. My favorite is the Shepard pie. \n\nSo here is a hint, If the Shepard pie is made with m Ground beef it is NOT Shepard pie.( its really Cottage pie) The good stuff is made with ground lamb.\n\nThe burgers I had were great and they actually cook them to the temp that you like. I usually order a meduim rare burger... IT WAS!!! \n\nSo it was Monday night and St Patties day to top it off. The crew remembered me from my day time lunch roamings. It was nice to have a Guiness or two, three,four...... I order a meal (don't remember what it was) but is was good and a great time.
3 ||| We took my mother-in-law and father-in-law here to celebrate Mother's Day.  We had a lovely dinner.  I had the mussels as an appetizer and they were just as good as the first time I had them.  The rest of the party had the heirloom tomato salad with fennel which was yummy.  I ordered the halibut for my entree and it was awesome.  My mother-in-law got the scallops and enjoyed them.  My husband and father-in-law both had the lamb and said it was delicious.  For dessert we had the Royal Bar, Banana's Foster Upsidedown Cake, Creme Brulee and gelato.  They were delicious.  My only complaint is that they keep sitting us by the door to the patio - next time I will request a different table.  The hostess was very pleasant this time though.
2 ||| I visited the PF Chang's in the South Park area recently, and it was just okay for me. Not horrible, and definitely not spectacular, but just okay. \n\nWe sat at the bar and the best part of our experience here was the bubbly bartender and the lone businessman sitting next to us. We had good conversation with them. But hey, you are reading this for a food review. So here goes:\n\nHot N Sour soup = pretty good. I must now admit that I have some insight into the land of PF Chang's, considering I used to be an employee at a NY location. Let's all be serious here; it's a chain, the mcdonald's of chinese food. The kitchen just pumps the meals out, and you will notice that you can have anything on the menu sitting in front of you within 5 or 6 minutes, minus the chilean seabass. They are so busy, and spit the food out so fast, it just isn't the kind of place that you are going to get a quality meal. \n\nI do recommend the mongolian beef - the mongolian sauce is excellent. Just be prepared for your hands and feet to swell given the sodium levels in this thing - out of control. I also always get the ma po tofu - this was the dish that got me into tofu in the first place, considering I never used to be able to say the word 'tofu' without gagging. It's very tasty, a bit crispy, and in a spicy/garlicky sauce with steamed broccoli. A third and final recommendation is the lemon pepper shrimp - again, the sauce is what makes this dish. If you have room for dessert, do yourself a favor and order the banana spring rolls - it's a night ender, but so worth it!\n\nI didn't find any yucky bugs in my meal, but I will say this: I've worked in plenty of restaurants, fancy and not, and I've seen them everywhere - it is inevitable that roaches will infiltrate. It's pretty unavoidable. That is disturbing though that it made it all the way onto your plate - a quality restaurant, a CLEAN restaurant, will take care of the problem right away before it gets that out of hand, and obviously PF Chang's is just not on that scale.
0 ||| If I could rate this any lower I would.  WORST EXPERIENCE IN MY 30 YEARS OF PURCHASING CARS.  Purchased car from Henderson CarMax on Sunday.  Car needed work on the roof, floor mats, brake light, arm of console in back of car didn't latch.  Salesman said, in front of me, husband, cashier, \"no problem, it will all be taken care of\".  Salesman didn't submit \"due bill\" and he then said I couldn't leave the car at the dealership for the work to be done on Monday but had to come back.  They couldn't take me to \nwork and didn't offer a loaner. \n\nAfter I threw a screaming fit in the Las Vegas dealership they promised to fix the car under the CarMax warranty.  LIARS - I just paid $351 for an oil change, tire rotation and the deductible on the extended warranty that I purchased. Brake lights seem to be fixed but amazingly they couldn't find the leak in the roof despite it pouring rain on me while I sat in the car.  It took 8 days and the console is still on back order. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE A CAR FROM CARMAX OR TRY TO HAVE IT SERVICED.
3 ||| I am a sucker for a good Mojito.  I heard they had good Mojitos so I made a trip.  I enjoyed the food, the environment was pretty nice and of course the drinks we amazing!  I was a little taken aback by the fact that they seat you in cheap plastic lawn chairs however, the rest of the experience was great! \nI will be back....
4 ||| This is a great furniture store.  Huge selection and great help.  Not pushy at all.  Have been here many times and have purchased quite a bit of furniture from them.  From the shopping experience to the purchase and delivery service, it is just terrific.  I have had several different sales people and they were all above average.  Will definitely  come back when I need to add to my furniture collection.
1 ||| The next few times that I went in (2 times to be exact), there was a hair in my food. The first time I sent my food back, the 2nd time I spoke with a manager. Since speaking with a manager I have not had a problem, and he was very well-meaning and hospitable. The only thing that keeps me coming back is their garlic citrus yellowtail. It is ridiculously good, when there aren't hairs in it.
0 ||| I placed an online order on August  27th.  I was given $30 kohls cash which expired on Sept 1st.    My order won't arrive until Sept 5th.  I wanted to wait to spend the cash until I received the order and could accessorize.  I would have spent considerably more at that time.  Customer service would not reissue the kohls cash.  I will be returning the online order when it arrives and will not shop at kohls in the future.
1 ||| Went there for lunch today and it was ok but not something I would crave again. \n\nThe pizza:\n\nCrust: good, nice flavor. \n\nSauce: it was tasty. \n\nHere is why it gets 3 stars. \n\nThe crust was too soft in the middle, it was droppy and there it wasn't even filled with toppings (cheese slice).  they need to leave it in the oven longer or something. \n\nThe cheese: for a cheese pizza there was not much cheese on it, I get it's a lunch special but how can you call it a cheese pizza with almost no cheese. \n\nService: the guy making the pizza has a great attitude but one of the cashiers was horid. She was yelling at another girl to help her and it wasn't even that busy. \n\nWould not return.
2 ||| A solid hotel, but nothing to rave about. \n\nI have stayed here a few times; it's not a bad hotel, let's get that out, I enjoyed staying at this hotel, but it doesn't rise to the level of a westin, or even the sheraton down the street (sheraton as a chain, is hit or miss, btw), but when you compare with other local hotels nearby, it's in the middle. \n\nOn a side note, it's in the middle of town, a short walk from everything, and a quick ride to Tempe or Scottsdale.  The local restaurant scene isn't that big, compared to seattle, but like a good reduction, what's there, is wonderful eats.  A few good places, featured on the Food Network. \n\nAll in all, it's a good location for business travel, no nonsense, soild hotel.  If you like Hyatt, then this is another winner.  If you like hip, this isn't the place for you.
4 ||| I just realized after using yelp to find everything after moving here that I haven't reviewed anyone to help the next person. \n\nI'm here to said I LOVE Heather Grider at Euphoria. I came to her with severely damaged hair and she within months got it to beautiful. \n\nI'm moving and my heart breaks because she is the best, THE BEST!!\n\nHighly recommend her to everyone(my husband loves her too)!!!
2 ||| I'm not actually mexican, so I may have a bit of a bias for the more american vein of mexican food.\n\nI waited for the perfect time and for when I was in the perfect condition to try this place- slightly drunk, and 12:45 AM. Upon walking into this fine establishment, I noticed it smelled like urine- like, as if I had walked into a public rest room. Because of this, I did not stay long here\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito that I enjoyed in the car on the way back home. And it was a-ok! The meat was good, loved the veggies and guac.... the highlight was definitely the tortilla. It tasted fresh. I do love me a fresh tortilla. It cost around 5 dollars, which is a great deal.\n\nIf you're up late and want some late night munchies, I definitely sugest roberto's. If you enjoy eating at establishments that don't reek of piss, then I would maybe hit up somewhere a little more expensive, where they probably pay their employees to clean.
1 ||| Expensive and too much five spices in the broth. They even charged extra for a bowl of broth; all other pho restaurant would have given it away for free. Would not come back!
2 ||| The pizza is great. Service? Not\nSo much. One of the waiters here asks every customer: \"Parmesan?\" Everyone said yes. But no cheese was forthcoming anytime during our meals. The closing time is 10:00 PM but they're putting chairs up on tables at 9:20? Tables around us go without cleaning and full I f dirty plates and drink cups during our entire meal. It just looks sloppy.\n\nHere's hoping they clean up their service to match the quality of the pizza.
0 ||| I received a gift certificate for this salon for a facial and a massage. I made my appointment, was called the week of my appointment to change the time, I was fine with this. I go the day of my appointment, and it had been cancelled. No phone call the day before, no apology, nothing. \n\nI made another appointment, didn't receive a call to confirm the appointment, so this time I called the day of an hour before my appointment to verify that it was still scheduled; it was. I get the the salon, wasn't offered water or anything (but the ppl that arrived after me were offered something). After 10 mins, the receptionist tells me that my facial had been cancelled, because the esthetician who was supposed to do it, had put me under another person and that new esthetician had just called out and had no knowledge of my appointment. \n\nConfused? Yeah, so was I. \n\nThe receptionist then tells me that they are going to make me another appointment and that she will see that the manager offers me something for free, given that I've made 2 appointments and both have been cancelled. She also mentioned that the manager would be calling me that day. I'm still waiting to hear back from the manager of the salon. If it wasn't for the gift certificate, I wouldn't be returning to this place. As far as recommendations, there are plenty of better salons, with much better customer service in Chandler or Gilbert.
4 ||| so fun I loved it my boyfriend took me on the tour for my birthday it was great i learned alot about pittsburgh and enjoyed the tour guide she was funny and very entertaining :) highly recommend going on this tour even if you live in pittsburgh!
0 ||| We have been using Suarez for every family birthday cake and other bakery needs since it opened, but it has really gone down hill, mostly since they started sharing space with Tizzerts.  Customer service has gotten awful.  I am not sure if it is the lack of space or the snooty Tizzerts folks rubbing off but I have finally had enough.  For the first time since the early 90s we are going elsewhere.
2 ||| It's ok. Just your regular ol' \"American\" Chinese joint. Nothing fancy or stand out. I wouldn't eat-in this place. Didn't seem too clean.
4 ||| I have always enjoyed going to this 4-story Belk at SouthPark mall.  The parking deck parking can be a bit of a pain trying to avoid all of the valet parking places, but once you find a spot, it's thousands of square feet of awesome.  \n\nLast night was a particularly good trip with some great sales going on.  Belk typically has quite a selection of red dot clearance items, and last night was no different.  I purchased a Ralph Lauren dress that was originally $169 for $31 (several discounts, plus signing up for a Belk card got it down to that price)!  I also got several other work appropriate dresses for under $20 each, leaving the store with a sack full of clothes for $120.  And the salesperson, Phyllis, was an absolute delight.  She took quite a bit of time with me (it was just after work on a Friday and the store wasn't terribly busy yet) and I really appreciate the great customer service, she was fantastic. \n\nI walked through the shoe section, but I am beginning to think if you aren't a pole dancer, it is really hard to find shoes (this goes for the other department stores as well) and I had trouble finding anything I liked - the shoe department is large and kind of overwhelming to me.  The clearance room was busy and a mess, so I skipped that completely,.\n\nThe cosmetics section is huge with every brand of makeup and perfume you can think of.  The jewelry department is well stocked and well priced.  And the purses, ohhhh the purses.... I had to walk through there VERY quickly so I wouldn't take some home with me.  \n\nIf parking in the deck near Belk, look above your head when you walk in to see what the sign says as to where you are parking - if you walk out the wrong door, it can be a bit confusing.  Happy shopping!
3 ||| I've been patronizing the Hillside Grill since it opened years ago.  I recently returned last month for an anniversary dinner and was VERY disappointed to see that the menu prices have skyrocketed!  My favorite seared ahi tuna is now $32.50 which is ridiculous.  In defense of the restaurant, I presume most of this increase is a way to pass on Hillside rent increases which is regretable.  My wife and I will not be dining here anymore as it has gotten way too expensive.  It's good but not THAT good.
2 ||| I'm used to putting up with bad service when it comes to French cuisine.  There must be something about the ability to pronounce the food and wine so much better than their patrons that makes the waiters and managers so pompous.  Yet March\u00e9 Bacchus' food and wine do not justify the how utterly inconsiderate was the staff.\n\nTucked behind a wine shop on the beachhead of a very artificial lake, the restaurant is actually quite quaint with its mini gazebos and picturesque view.  Nature has been harnessed and brought tableside.  But the table layout certainly feels fun and romantic.  \n\nWines by the glass are quite pricey.  You might as well reach to the \"reserve\" side of the menu for just a few dollars more.  The Rhone wines on the reserve list were very nice but nothing that quite justified the cost.  Others we tried throughout the night were all good but not great.  To me, the Frank's Family Cabernet may be the only wine worth its weight.\n\nThe escargot was wonderfully soft and had a surprising finish of citrus.  The foie gras was very nice and lighter than expected.  The charcuterie was fun and represented the last thing we would truly enjoy.  For the kitchen ran out of duck confit on this Sunday night.  The duck breast was so atrociously salty it made me think of flash fried spam.  And the tenderloin was overly salted and overcooked.  Thankfully, its wine reduction gravy saved the dish from being sent back.\n\nInconsiderate is the best way I can sum up the service we experienced.  The waiter did not listen.  He ran away from our table even when we yelled to him to bring him back.  Our requests went unfilled just as our water glasses went unfilled.  When one wine was no longer available, the manager himself brought out a completely different varietal (Shiraz, which many including myself find repulsive).  Without bothering to ask what other wine we would prefer at nearly $16 a glass, the manager just assumed that we would accept his subjective palate and judgment in lieu of our own as to which wine we would find most pleasing.  He plunked down the Shiraz and dallied away as if everything were wonderful.  Later, the waiter could not confirm whether the Shiraz I was given was the expensive Shiraz on the menu or some cheap substitute, so I naturally assumed it was the latter.  We sent back the Shiraz in lieu of another varietal and then reminded the staff that we had also asked three to four times for yet a different glass of wine for another guest in our party.  The manager again assumed that his foreign charm would make all amends, until we finally had to make clear by yelling in unison that there were still two outstanding wine orders that had not been fulfilled.  We then still had to remind the staff another three times for the wine, and finally received it at a freezing temperature.  The staff then disappeared altogether by the time we had begun our meals and we wanted to order a bottle of the freezing wine.   Needless to say, we left quite sober and thirsty from having neither enough wine nor water.\n\nThe denouement was the attempt to sort out the dinner coupon.  Aside from the comedy of errors that ensued in processing the coupon, the staff had the audacity to foist an 18% gratuity on our party of four.  Mon dieu!\n\nWe absolutely expect better from a restaurant that is supposed to know about fine wine and fine dining.  Attempting to placate a guest with Shiraz after running out of a completely different wine and without asking is just insulting.  That act alone exemplifies the different between knowing how to run a restaurant and just posing as if.
3 ||| Maybe I've just been lucky - I've always had great experiences at Zoe's.  The albacore tuna pita is great, as is the Greek chicken pita.  Today I had the Chicken pita pizza - amazeballs!  Also, the marinated slaw is to die for - huge chunks of feta cheese.  The service is always fast and friendly, and the food is always fresh.  It's a great lunch spot, if you can find a parking spot ;-)
2 ||| My downtown friend saved me from the Arizona Center (where the Los Olivos car wash dropped me off) and took me here.  For under $7, their lunch deal was pretty amazing.  Pick a (good) sandwich, side and chips.  The reason why I'm impressed it was a whole chicken breast in my Med Chicken sandwich... I thought Greek marinara meant code for the tzitiki (sic) sauce, but really it was red marinara... Greek maybe for the green seasoning on the chicken?\n\nOverall it was tasty, and the lemon limeade my friend calls crack.  Six blocks from Los Olivos car wash if you're trying to kill time.  Saw they have a security enabled wifi network but didn't try asking for the wep key to see if they share.

1 ||| Over priced and overrated. While I admit the butternut squash ravioli was enjoyable, the calamari was flavorless rubber and the tiramisu was lackluster at best. Randall and Andrew are wonderful servers, but I found Gaetano himself to be incredibly off-putting. I've also heard tell that he has a tendency to treat his employees with disrespect, and as a former service industry employee myself, I take serious issue with that. Overall, not an establishment I care to patronize again.
1 ||| TERRIBLE service from beginning to end. Bad hosts, bad server. It sucks. But the food is ALWAYS amazing. I would deal with shitty service for their awesome food.
2 ||| Pretty good, but I can think of other Mexican places I prefer. The service here was ATTENTIVE but a bit disorganized. I asked 3 different people to bring water for hubby and I (we were the last in our group to arrive) and we wound up with one water glass. However, they were quick to bring refills of chips and salsa, and checked on us frequently throughout the meal. The water glasses may have been a fluke because it was a pretty crowded table and we didn't have any other issues with the service.\nThe food was decent, if a bit spicy for my taste. Yeah, I know it is Mexican and I'm a wimp. No one else seemed to mind, so take that with a grain of salt. It did seem to sit a bit lighter than most Mexican food, so that was good. The margaritas were STRONG and a pitcher was more than enough for the 4 of us.
4 ||| This place deserves 5 stars for many reasons. It's big and clean with a nice ambience. All the technicians are very friendly and professional. I highly recommend Andy, he's very good at what he does.
0 ||| Nice staff but the good was not good. I could get the same thing at grocery store.
3 ||| I kid you not, we came here 3 days in a row straight for lunch! Yes, it's that good, consistently good. They have an extensive menu with many Vietnamese dishes that you can think of even though it's called Pho So 1. They have pho, hieu tieu (which was the crowd favorite), grilled plate, bun bo, rice and vermicelli noodle dishes, etc. Many of us ordered the pho but I thought the broth was a little off for me. I do like the bun bo though, lots of flavor. The girls who ordered the nem nuong or grilled beef, it came out on a huge platter! Prices are fair too. Complete your meal with a ca phe sua da phin (french ice coffee with condensed milk) like I did on all three days!
1 ||| The duck curry is tasty and the pineapple is definitely an interesting element, however we faced many frustrations when dealing with this establishment; from unspecified charges to the take-out containers literally splitting in my hands and spilling saucy mess everywhere... \n\nThere were many ingredients that seemed out of place in the curry and led me to believe they'd tossed a frozen bag of stir-fry mix into the pot rather than utilizing fresh vegetables. The texture of the shrimp used in their soup was completely off, like they'd been handled wrong (overcooked, refrozen, something). While the flavors were interesting, the irritations involved with obtaining the food and the distance will prohibit us from returning.
2 ||| Food network.  Good!!
2 ||| I love this place for the tofu soup. It is fast, hot, satisfying, and inexpensive. I have been going here for about 4 years now. I also like that they bring out a \"pupu\" tray of appetizers, like potato pancakes and kimchee to snack on as you wait.
2 ||| PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.
4 ||| i would say this is a dive bar. but it's kind of big for a dive... and it's got a pretty big patio, which doesn't really seem to be a \"dive\" thing. but you can bet on horses and dogs and that's pretty dive-esque.\n\na big, four-sided bar right in the middle and shuffle board (any bar with shuffle board pretty much kicks ass) and a skill crane game. they do free texas hold 'em every weekend, and all the participants are friendly and it's a good time.\n\nthey serve food, the wings are kind of awesome, but i'm not a wing connoissuer by any means. a great, cheap little bar to escape to when the usual scene gets old, i affectionately refer to it as the \"Ho-Ho.\"
3 ||| Great curry, beef salad and noodle dishes.  Not as spicy as first time I came here but they have ground flakes on the table along with soy and fish sauce.  Always enjoy eating here when I'm on this end of town.
0 ||| I had an appointment with the Genius Bar because my power button doesn't work on my iPhone and I still had to wait around for 50 minutes before the rudest manager approached me.  The 'manager' Jim  was  arrogant and disrespectful. Immediately you could tell he was not going to reason with me because my IPhones warrenty expired 4 days ago! I did ask if he could work with me since I contacted Apple's online services  a week prior and they told me it was a malfunction with my phone and to come into the store.  The warrenty was never brought to my attention, not to mention how about a grace period! Jim, being full of himself, said of course he could help me; I just needed to pay for another iPhone at full price.  This is the worst customer service I have ever received in my life!  Warning to all: do not go to this apple store.
2 ||| Nice restaurant in downtown Champaign.  Has a really nice atmosphere.  Good selection of wines.  I really wanted to like this place but in the end, their food is just forgettable.  I had the lamb once and that was a bit rough, not tender.  Also tried the salmon (or some other fish) once, also a bit overcooked.  Dessert menu was very standard.
1 ||| Terrible happy hour sushi menu!\n\nAte here on the 20th after a long bout (at least a year?).  The same two chefs, Julio and Roberto, were still there, as well as Leo, the manager.  I re-informed them about my allergies and placed my order: spicy tuna ($4.50), spicy salmon ($4.50), and a soft-shelled crab roll ($7.95).  Julio prepared the first two, while Roberto prepared the crab.  I was fortunate enough to ask Roberto what he was going to substitute the * w/.  He said he could use radishes and yamagobo (pickled burdock; looks like julienned carrots).  Had I not said anything, I may have been disappointed w/ the crab roll as I was w/ the other two rolls... The tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling.  I ate a few pcs. of each dish and gave up.  (Hey, I was hungry!!)  Had leftovers packed, then decided I'd say something to Leo, who was kind enough to comp. one of the entrees.  Fair enough, since I ate the equivalent of one.  Should I return again for happy hour, I'll probably just stick to two rolls- the dependable soft-shelled crab roll, w/c is wrapped in nori, then rice, and then w/ omelet, thin-sliced.  Yum!  \n\nSince I didn't enjoy the other two sushi rolls, I replaced them w/ a rainbow roll ($8.95), w/c originally consists of salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and shrimp, w/ avocado and cucumber.  Mine came w/o certain items, but still was pretty tasty, and definitely more colorful, and more texturally-satiating than the mashed disasters that were the salmon and tuna sushi.\n\nProbably won't be returning anytime soon for happy hour.  Certainly not since I've found a new place for happy hour sushi... Tempe's Sushi 101!
1 ||| Really disappointed - place is not as good as it used to be.
0 ||| I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place.
2 ||| Let's talk dogs. Okay, I have a little 4-pound Maltese who is just the sweetest little pup I have ever had! Since his size is so convenient, he usually goes shopping with me and rides in my purse. Well this weekend we went to his favorite store to pick up some dog food. \n\nI have been to many PetSmarts around the valley, but I don't remember any of them being as cramped as this store is. I could hardly steer my cart around the huge displays in the middle of the aisles and since the store was a little busy, trying to get around the store was quite impossible. After I located the dog food, we spent some time looking between brands of food...I mean I like variety, so why should he be stuck with the same food day in and day out? But I couldn't find any one to talk to to answer my questions about the two choices I had: his old food, Iams for small breeds or this new one Eukanuba for Yorkies. Yes, I know my dog is not a Yorkie (as I mentioned above), but Maltese and Yorkies are pretty close with their: long hair, cute little faces, and a personalities bigger than their small size. I just wasn't sure of the benefits of one over the other and Eukanuba is significantly more expensive, which I don't mind, but I want to make sure the benefits are worth the cost. Any ways, there was no one around to ask, which was disappointing - because I'm not the best at making these kinds of decisions on my own. So I stuck with the old, but good ol' Iams brand.\n\nWe went to check out and the reason this place received 3 stars instead of just 2 is because the lady who checked us out was really nice and showered my sweet little puppy with loves and treats and I know she made his day!
0 ||| Barf.\n\nReally. That is the only way to explain West Towne Mall these days. Between the man-eating/car eating potholes (yea yea yea, cold patching sucks, I get it, but it's better to cold patch THAN HAVE MASSIVE POTHOLES ALL OVER THE PARKING LOT) and the disgusting bathrooms, this place is becoming gross. While I can't speak for the mens rooms, the ladies rooms here are ATROCIOUS. You better bring your puddle jumpers, because the floor is constantly wet. With what, you might ask? Who knows. \n\nI am all for mall loitering/drinking coffee while walking around/looking for new and sparkly crap to bring home, but these days I avoid this place like the plague. If I need something, I get in, and I get out. \n\nCan we also talk about that little booth in the center of the mall (near Francescas) with the European guys trying to sell me a new hair straightener? When you whistle at me to try to get my attention and say \"Come here lady\", be prepared to get mean-mugged... if not worse. I have no problem (kindly, of course...) telling those fine, polite gentlemen where to go. \n\nUnless I need something that can only be found at a store at West Towne, I'm out. \n\nFix the dang potholes. Fix the nas-tay bathrooms. And get rid of those terrible men near the Francescas. They creepy.
4 ||| I have been taking my dogs to Misti Sue's Grooming for 10 years now. Misti trained my airedale on her table from the time he was 6 mos. old. As you know that breed is phenomenal but quite a challenge. Nevertheless, Misti persevered with George W. and through that love and training he is quite a role model (if I do say so myself :) )\n     My dogs look forward to going in every month because of the care and trust Misti has established with them AND me! That shop goes above and beyond to give great personal customer service. For example, when my daughter graduated Misti knew the colors of my daughter's \"Graduation Open House\", Misti purchased  a fancy black dress with white dots on it for my daughter's yorkie mix and painted my daughter's dog's nails black with white dots (this was right up my daughter's alley). Needless to say, we were overjoyed at what she did at her own cost!! They really do treat pets like they are their own children!!!   I highly recommend Misti Sue's Grooming for the grooming knowledge, care and love they provide. Not to mention, the cost was very reasonable and location quite accessible. I give Misti Sue's 5 stars because she listens to me when I explain in detail what I want.
3 ||| I have to say that this was a regular stop for me and my friends during high school. We loved this place, but then a few years ago (5 or so) it took a serious nose dive. The portions lessened and the quality became really sloppy and staff seemed not to care. Eventually I just stopped going altogether. \n\nThen, last week I decided to give it another try. I have to say, they are back! Portions were large, the Southwest Club was as good as it use to be (recommend that you request that they go light on the raspberry mayo) and the soups are awesome. So happy that this place got back to it's roots; the very reason they were able to become a chain in the first place.\n\nRecently re-recommended :)
0 ||| This one is a fiasco. Compared to the one (same name) in Irvine, CA it is a joke. The food taste really bad, the service is way below par and they don't care one way or the other if you ever come back. I guess they have enough local citizens from China where they do not have to miss anyone. We use to go there a lot for we do love chinese food but after going to California and eating at the Sam Woo in Jeffrey Rd. (Irvine) is like comparing a cold burger to a freshly made In and Out. We ordered several dishes and most were served cold and tasted like, really prefer not to say it. I would encourage patrons who love chinese food to go to the Pin Pan Pon in the Gold Coast Casino. At least there the food is above average. Besides the fact that they only accept cash, Sam Woo in Spring Mt. Road is not worth spending your hard earned money. Bad Attitude, Terrible Food, what is there to like? 0 Stars!
3 ||| Although I'm scared of bird (I suffered a vicious peacock attack as a child (seriously)), this place was pretty cool.\n\nWe just happened to arrive as one a raptor presentation was beginning.  Seeing a presentation is a must (the trip would have not been as good without it).  The woman doing the presentation brought out a number of birds and told us lots of interesting info about them.\n\nAfter that, we just walked around to the different cages and checked out the other birds.  If you want to take pictures, bring a camera with a zoom lens (I couldn't get close enough for my iPhone pictures to be very good).
1 ||| I wanted to try something new, and this place was alright. The waiting time was so long, and I didn't find it to be the most sanitary place to eat just because the hands that prepared the food were the hands that opened and closed the door. No gloves whatsoever. I was served my food by the chef, who had creamy gunk all over his fingers. Nevertheless, I ate the taco since I was too hungry from waiting... And it was alright.
1 ||| We were looking for a different chinese place but when we got there it wasn't open yet so we gave this one a try.\n\nThis is an older place, kind of a hole but I noticed that the staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. The waitstaff was friendly.  The food was ok, it wasn't exactly good but most of it was edible.  $7.25 for the buffet on the weekend but I think it's cheaper during the week, $6.25 or something like that was on the sign.\n\n2 drinks, 2 buffets came to $19 and some change.  \n\nI wouldn't really recommend this place, they didn't do anything \"wrong\" but they don't do anything right either.
2 ||| We went here for my daughter's birthday a few days ago. I was really interested because I've been to some very modernized Red Robin's in my day. The only thing my 4 year old wanted was Mac 'n Cheese and there's is good. \n\nWhat do I like? I like the bottomless steak friends (believe me, they are bottomless!) and the bottomless speckled lemonade. Yummy strawberries in the drink itself! \n\nTypically the burgers are good and I am picky, but this time mine was under done and that really bothered me. Also, our waitress was not very fast at all. She barely even came and when she did bring more lemonade, she just dropped it by without asking if we needed anything else. \n\nThey do have a free sundae for birthdays, but they didn't try to upsale dessert to the rest of the party before bringing it out (they could've made a few more bucks if they had!)\n\nOverall, not bad, but I've been to better.
4 ||| This is a super classy Fry's! They have a Starbucks, nice floors and lighting, and a natural foods sections, which I love! Healthy and organic shopping is becoming a lot easier to do at Fry's. Great deals and savings on milk!
4 ||| Lots of fun stuff. Planitarium really neat. Great learning and hands on for kids and the kids at heart.
1 ||| IHOP used to be good, but in recent years has become overpriced and very mediocre. You have to practically beg for warm syrup at this place. Seriously?
2 ||| Won't even try to deny it.  I'm a Bath & Body Works junkie! \n\nThere's a Wallflower in almost every room of my house; hand soap in my bathrooms and kitchen. \n\nIf B&BW ever discontinued the Sensual Amber, Forever Red or Country Chic body care lines, I might curl up and die- been using Sensual Amber since 2007! \n\nYeah, you get the picture. \n\nAssociates are always super helpful and fun to chat with whether you're looking for something new to try, getting your standbys or simply browsing on your lunch break.\n\nLook for Buy 3, get 3 free on body care. 4 for $20 Wallflowers. 5 for $15 hand soaps. Sometimes 2 for $22 candles!  \n\nWhy this review lost two stars: One of the managers! Lady is extra pushy on sales, so forget a peaceful \"window shopping\" session. Have witnessed her being an angel in the face of customers, then an absolute troll to her associates in the same breath. Just plain awful.  \n\nAlso, as a previous reviewer mentioned: She will always assume you're shoplifting, especially if you're on a mission and know exactly what you're going to purchase. Space bubble: Please respect it!\n\nBut overall, great customer service and products! Will I continue shopping here? You betcha!
0 ||| WHAT A DISGRACE!!! My family and I absolutely LOVE blueberry Hill, but NOT THIS ONE. Waited 10 minutes to try and get our name put on the list but had no luck. We ended up leaving after the \"manager\" would just pass by us, and others, in order to seat others that were already on the list. Never stopped to take our names so we just left. During those 10 minutes, we asked the cashier how we are able to get on the waiting list. She replied \"THE MANAGER IS DOING THAT\". Then we asked how he would know who came in first and she replied, \"HE DOESNT\" as she chuckled slightly.
2 ||| Grade: C-\n\nI hate Applebee's. It only tasted good because I'm on a diet.
3 ||| I needed a new gate for my house so asked my good friend Google.  This placed popped up and they have a solid web site and look pretty reputable ( www.actiongateaz.com ).   I sent them a request for an estimate via their online contact form.  They got back to me via email after a few days to schedule an appointment.\n\nTheir rep (Gary) arrived within the time-window given.  Turns out he is the owner and couldn't have been a nicer guy.  He looked at my current gate configuration and listed the replacement options in an honest and straightforward way.\n\nMy wife and I decided on a new gate on the spot and placed the order.  He said it would take about 3 weeks to make and install the thing because his company is so busy.  The only bummer is that it took over a month but it is ok because our new gate looks fantastic.\n\nScheduling the estimate and install were both a breeze, they have great customer service and a great product.  I'm told my gate is going to last forever so I probably won't have to use this company again, but I would in a heartbeat if needed.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like is that they didn't call me after the install to make sure everything was ok.  Another thing is that I chose a stupid handle/lock combo and Gary didn't tell me it was dumb when I ordered it.
2 ||| The chicken broccoli lunch special really hit the spot. There were plenty of vegetables (just what I was looking for!) and it came with your choice of 2 side orders ($5.75 after tax). I was glad they had brown rice, but there were no other healthy side order choices. I opted for the shrimp egg roll, which tasted kinda bleachy on the inside. Stay away! Should've gotten 2 orders of brown rice because they don't give you much rice.\n\nThey carry some Thai food as well as Teppenyaki (how odd...), and for dinner they have small orders that come with rice - just $5. I wish they had soups on the menu, mapo tofu, or bbq pork (some of my favorite dishes). I'd come back anyway, plus the owner is Malaysian and very nice. Best part? They take AMEX!
4 ||| I am writing an update to Magee Women's Hospital.  My attitude towards them has not changed.  This is still the best place for a woman to get healthcare, especially ob-gyn services.  But it will soon be the tenth anniversary of my second of three surgeries I had to have done.  In looking back, I don't know how I could have had them done anywhere else.\n\nThe second surgery was bad enough, the third was even more serious because it involved a life-changing decision.  Instead of being very cold about it, I was given my options and told calmly and with empathy, \"Susan, this has to be done\".  And I'm telling you that despite the difficult choice I had to make, they guided me through the entire process.
4 ||| Love this dry cleaner they are hands down the best place to have your items cleaned and washed!!
2 ||| Really good food but service was not at all good! We waited so long, our waiter was not a people person, didn't tell us about portion sizes, and the place was pretty dirty. (Can't imagine how the kitchen looks)
4 ||| I can be a picky chooser but everything here is soo yummy. Sometimes it get's hard to choose but if you're craving pasta, delicious salads, handcrafted sandwiches or bread and only have about less than an hour to spare, Panera is the place to go. It's classy, very clean, staff friendly and delicious. \n\nAlso a place where you can study, hang out with friends, host a meeting etc. Definately a place I'll be going as long as there's one open.
4 ||| We stayed one night after spending hours looking over getting the best hotel room to meet our needs without spending outside our budget for a one night midweek getaway with the kids. \n\nThis hotel was hands down the best of everything in this class of hotel. The stocked kitchen was a bonus. Upon arrival the place appeared well kept, the lobby is beautiful and inviting. As soon as I stepped within site of the desk clerk he lifted his face to make eye contact, smiled and said \"welcome\". I enjoy that warm feeling that YES, I am spending money to stimulate your business and yes it is recognized. Check in took less then 2 minutes and I was back out the door to park. When I noticed the basket of FREE Paradise Bakery Cookies, I asked \"who are the cookies for?\" the clerk smiled and replied \"why they are for you\"\n\nUpon opening the door to our room the baby shrieked with joy when she noticed the twin bears on the desk with a note that they were specially for her. After admiring all our room had to offer we quickly got into our suits and headed to the pool, but not before stopping at the front desk to inquire about ice. Again as soon as I entered the lobby the lady behind the desk smiled, made eye contact with me, smiled and asked how she could assist me. She explained I could get ice in the Hearth room soda machine at any time, but she wanted to get it for me from the kitchen. She stopped to play with my one year old and inquired that she had already become fond of the bears. When I told her that one bear was suppose be brothers, she said \"please let me know if we can help you with that, we don't want it to be a problem for you, we have plenty of bears\". WOW.. okay, I was staying, and sold. \n\nThe pool was just cool enough and inviting.  Again we were there midweek after school started so it was quiet. The grounds were pretty and we enjoyed the inviting tranquility of all it had to offer. Everyone we came into contact with smiled, weather they were picking up towels, fixing the landscaping, etc. \n\nThe Hearth Room and Reception. That was more than we expected. Wine, beer, egg roll, rice, salad, pasta salad, juice, coke products, fruits, popcorn, chips and salsa. We were not able to eat dinner until 10:30 PM after that reception. We probably could have skipped dinner.\n\nThe bed was so darn comfortable we almost slept past the complimentary breakfast time. We woke to the USA at the front door and ran to get what we think was a wonderful \"free\" breakfast spread, much different from what we are use to. We are talking scrambled eggs, hardboiled eggs, poached eggs, corn-beef hash, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee, juices, many different bread choices, yogurt, fruits, wow we were amazed.  The children were happy, we were happy. \n\nThe Gainey Hotel and Suits have been bookmarked as our favorite places to stay, I would not hesitate to recommend it as well as we will be staying there again ourselves, as we live local. Oh and I forgot to mention the staff that assisted my husband out in the parking lot in replacing a headlamp in the 108 degree weather. This place is awesome!
4 ||| When I get sick, I kind of get happy. Not because that means my diet will most likely consist of soup and ice cream since those are my sick comfort foods but because of Carmel Family Physicians.\n\nI've been going here for the past 5yrs and could not be happier with the treatment I've gotten. From bronchitis to strep throat to sinus infections to upper respiratory infections to food poisoning--they've helped me with almost everything under the sun. They are located right near the CMC off 51 and 485 and have very convenient hours---I'm talking until 8P on weeknights plus Saturday and Sunday walk in hours. In the past I've been able to call in for an appointment the same day which is pretty much unheard of at any doctor's office I've been to. They have a number of doctors and physician assistants there Clint Price is awesome, so see him!\n\nNice staff, recent magazines, in and out within 20 minutes. Yeah, I dig.
1 ||| I can't really give a food review since I didn't order anything, but there is a reason why I didn't order anything.\n\nMy brother and his friends had the midnight munchies after the whole pub crawling. Being the responsible little sister, I \"chaperoned\" the boys and went the Ritters with them. I wasn't in the mood to eat after midnight, but that's not the reason why I didn't order anything. The reason why I didn't get anything was because when we walked in the diner, I looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach. Must've been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and I guessed correctly. My brother had the Arcadian burger and by sunrise, his stomach didn't settle well. Had no desire to eat throughout the day.\n\nTrust your eyes, nose, and instinct. It's most likely right.
4 ||| What's the problem? I love this place. Every time I come here, its never packed... employees are nice... and  there is always a place to sit and relax with your coffee.
4 ||| The Cedar Plank Salmon is by far THE best salmon I've ever had.\n\nThe C.A.B. burger is one of my top 3 favorite burgers (self-proclaimed burger critic here).\n\nBest Lobster Mac & Cheese  I've ever had (doesn't have that strong seafood taste/flavor that a lot if seafood Mac & cheese dishes have).\n\nBoth the steak Cobb salad and strawberry chicken salad are amazing (and huge- definitely can split these)\n\nI don't think there's a dish you could go wrong with here (except during restaurant week when they had a po-boy on the menu- was not impressed. But it was a po-boy sandwich so, you know, not that shocking)
4 ||| Best place ever! The product is amazing and the is friendly, knowledgable, and made me feel welcome.
3 ||| This is a terrific \"local\" place. The menu isn't expansive and that's part of the charm. The food is about is very good and I've never been disappointed (been there dozens of times), it's clean and service is quick. They are friendly, even going around to the \"children\" tables and challenging them to \"Texas Trivia\". I take my out of town friends there.  This is a best reason for overnight guests! The catfish is the best.... really... the best.
3 ||| This place is everything a diner should be!  The food is good.  The service is prompt and friendly.  The prices are quite reasonable.  The portions will not leave you hungry.  I am looking forward to my next visit!
4 ||| My husband and I really did our homework before making an appointment but it was pretty obvious that Ace's is definitely the best place in Charlotte to get a tattoo.  Hundreds of trophy's and awards line the walls of the shop showcasing their talent.  After checking out the portfolios we decided to make an appointment with Chansler two weeks later.  \n\nWhen we went in for our appointment, Chansler already had my husband's tattoo stenciled out.  He did an amazing job and every detail was immaculate.\n\nChansler designed my tattoo based on some pictures I'd shown him and completely captured exactly what I wanted.  He added so much detail that I'd never even considered and I am incredibly happy to say the least.  Not to mention, he doesn't charge extra for his custom designs!  \n\nI'd recommend anyone to Ace's and would definitely ask for Chansler.  I can't wait to schedule my next tattoo!!
4 ||| Ive been using discount for quite a while now, for all my tire needs.  They always have great service, and great prices (yes, I did do some comparison shopping).
0 ||| ***No bueno.\n\nThe spinach enchiladas I didnt 'peso' much for, came out looking like Enchiladas  Benedict. I dont know what was on top, but it appeared to be poached eggs. \n\nMy friend paid for the meal and I was trying to be courtesy and eat some of it. \nLittle did I know I would be vomiting chunky spinach 3 hours later. \n\nI ate corn nuts, carmel corn and even pasta with Alfredo sauce AFTER I ate at Caramba but none of that came out when I spewed. How does that occur?\n\nOnly the spinach and cheese from yummy Caramba was left floating in the porcelain bowl.
3 ||| Pretty good food.  The orange chicken was a bit TOO sweet, but I am partially responsible for not asking for hot oil.  Egg rolls are fresh, and their pork fried rice is spot on.  Probably the best chinese joint in the east valley.
2 ||| I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.
4 ||| I have only the most positive things to say about Josh Sosnow and North Scottsdale Animal Hospital!  We have been going there for 6 years now and have only had the best service, care and compassion.  All of the staff is nice and patient and gives you the time you deserve during your appointment.  We take our dog there for grooming as well and have only had good experiences. Dr. Josh also referred us to Brice Cavanaugh, a dog trainer who saved my dog's life and mine :).    You really can teach an old dog new tricks. My family is very thankful to both Josh and Brice!
0 ||| I don't yelp I've never felt the need to but something this amazing I want to share. Celebrating a birthday and return from the army with my family we decided to go here...whenever my sister is on leave from the army we always go at least once before she reports back. Anyway this is not important what is is the fact that the collard greens were on point today so amazing so good slightly spicier than normal but amazing nonetheless. The catfish out of this world it was crunchy it wasn't murky absolutely perfect! Also important to the story you should know that I literally get paid to taste it is my job I'm a chef. Now here's what happened...I ordered the fried chicken and waffles for my children I tasted a piece of chicken because I noticed that they were not eating it and it tasted like peanut butter. Keep in mind that I am at a table with three adults and three children with one more adult also a chef on the way to join us. Working in the industry I called over my server and I mentioned it to him he went to the manager which is what you're supposed to do they tasted a different piece of chicken and proceeded to come and literally disrespect me in front of my whole family. The general manager told me that not only were my taste buds wrong but I should eat less peanut butter. Seriously eat less peanut butter? Now I sat there shocked but I told him the other adults also tasted the same thing he said they were wrong. Then the manager accuses me of actively looking for something to complain of in my meal to get free things. Keep in mind I didn't even order the chicken which he then mocked me for eating my kids food. I had catfish which I ate all of and it was amazing. Also keep in mind that I still proceeded to spend more money on a dessert and drinks but they decided to freeze out our whole table and we sat and waited for 25 minutes for our bill nobody came. When our other guests came to join no one came to take his order so he shared a water with me and ate the leftover food from the birthday girl. No one even acknowledged us we had to flag down another completely different server or maybe it was a busser to get our tab. I wish I would've recorded his response(manager) to me because it was that outlandish. So sadly my first yelp review ever is a terrible one.
3 ||| Went here for an early Valentine's Dinner last night. The service was great. We both ordered the pasta trio and the waiters' were very attentive at filling up our plates as soon as they neared empty. We also got the Polito appetizer to start and it was delicious- mix of octopus, potatoes, capers, onions and olives. Also, their wine bottles for $29 are a great deal. Just took off one star for the decor- a little outdated. Still a great night though- definitely recommend.
3 ||| If you're a pet person, chances are, you've been to Petsmart more times than you can count... with so many locations, I'm not sure it really matters which one you go to, but this one has been good to me over the past year and a half.  Minnie's had her fair share of grooming appointments at this location, simply because I can usually call and get a same-day appointment.  For whatever reason, the other locations seem to be full ahead of time.  This one is also easy to get in and out pretty quickly, parking is never a problem, and the staff is friendly.\n\nJust like any good Petsmart, they carry anything and everything you can imagine for your 'kid.'  I fill up on food (wet and dry) and usually get some treats and toys for Minnie during my visits.  \n\nMinnie and I will be moving soon and the big question becomes... 'which Petsmart will become our new fave?'  Time will tell... luckily, we have a lot to choose from!
0 ||| No customer service! I have spent since September waiting for a replacement part on a sofa where the technician from Pruitt's said \"the leather is bad\". I have been given the run around ever since. They've given me delivery dates of October, then beginning of December, then January. Here it is February and they claim to know nothing. They refused to provide me with the manufacturer phone number, owners number or email address. They claimed they don't have that information! Ha! I looked up the manufacturer myself and called them... Had the answer is 5 minutes that I've been waiting on for over a week. These people are uninterested in helping once they have your money. We've purchased lots of items from them in the last 10 years and their quality has gone way down as has their respect for the people who spend money there. Never again!! Please consider purchasing from another store who will care to treat their long time or any  customers well.
4 ||| This salon is very welcoming.  Krissy is an artist when it comes to cut and color.  She's also great to talk to.  I definitely recommend Beauty Worx!
3 ||| Always loved Jason's Deli. Been visiting since 2001, frequenting the location in Summerlin in Boca Park. They never let me down with the selection of vegetarian meals.\n\nThis location is pretty nice. Love coming here for lunch. The Zucchini Grillini and Spinach Veggie Wraps are my go to meals. Always a great experience. The staff here is great and I love that they come to your table with your food and come to pick up your plates afterwards. Note, this is like a sit down restaurant experience outside of having to stand in line to order. So, I try and leave a tip at the table when possible for the table service. Also love the option of a free ice cream cone after lunch, if you so desire. \n\nI recommend this location. Great sandwiches and great service. Thumbs up from this guy!
1 ||| The past 2-3 times we have been to I Love Sushi, we feel as if it's gone downhill.  The service has been terrible.  The food & rolls were not as fresh as usual and just plain blah.  I am very disappointed...\n\nHelp, we need a new sushi home!
0 ||| So for...15 years I have described PF Changs to people as: \"If I had to eat at a restaurant every day for the rest of my life, I'd choose PF Changs.\" Well...after my last several visits, it is no longer my favorite, and frankly, I don't even care if I ever eat there again.\n\nThe chicken lettuce wraps have always been a MUST for me...but the last several times I got them, they were a smaller portion and different somehow. I don't know if there is a change to the recipe or they messed them up every time....all I know is I didn't feel impressed with them like I used to. Many times in the past I would eat lettuce wraps as my meal because I liked them so much...last couple times I didn't even eat 2 wraps. :(\n\nThe shrimp with lobster sauce has always been my favorite. Sure, it looks like snot with shrimp and egg in it, but the flavor was always sooooooo good. Last time I went there were TONS of peas in it (there used to be just a few...enough to give it a hint of flavor and color), huge slices of mushroom that overwhelmed the flavor of the entire dish (there used to be little cubes that just gave it a teeny perfect touch of flavor), and when I asked about the recipe change the waiter said it has always been the same. Uhhhh....NO. No it has not, sir! I don't know how long you have been working at PF Changs but I have been eating the SAME DISH probably 80% of the times I have visited since 1999 when I moved here and discovered PF Changs. I can tell you that it is very very different and has changed within the last...6 months maybe. It's most certainly a change and not a good one. I didn't like it at all. To make matters worse, I ordered it on my birthday last month and didn't even eat more than a couple bites because I was so disappointed with the flavor. No use taking leftovers home when you have no interest in eating them either. It sucked.\n\nThe beautiful Asian decor has always been appealing to me...one of my favorite parts of eating there. I used to imagine how awesome it would be to have similar decoration in my own home. But...they've recently begun remodeling to some kind of snooty contemporary crap. I don't like it at all. Feels very cold and Scottsdale-ish.\n\nOn top of all this, there was the credit card debacle. I had to get a new card because of it. I know it's not their fault and they did everything they had to once they found out in order to prevent it from happening again. However, it was just another negative in about a 6 month line of bad PF Changs visits that put a bad taste in my mouth; literally and figuratively.\n\nI don't know if PF Changs business was down or if customers expressed some desire for all these changes, but whatever the reason, they have lost me as a customer. I'm sad about this. It was my absolute fave for 15 years.
3 ||| I have been lucky enough to visit some amazing zoos in my life.  That being said, the Phoenix Zoo did not disappoint!  Make sure you wear your walking shoes; the open concept layout lends itself to long, meandering strolls through the exhibits.  The place is huge!  I also found this zoo, more so than any other, to be very child oriented.  There are splash pads, paddle boats, a carousel, petting zoo, a hands-on stingray exhibit....the list goes on.  The animal enclosures, or lack-thereof, are a refreshing change to those seen in many older zoos.  The exhibits are expansive and the animals seem happy and well cared for.  If you have kids, this is an absolute must see in Phoenix. If you don't have kids yet...get busy.  You need a good excuse to hit this spot more often!
3 ||| Another of the \"pretty darned good\" Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. Maybe it's not perfectly authentic, but the food quality and quantity is excellent. It is definitely on par with any of the other similar restaurants I have Yelped.\n\nVery wide menu, which includes several vegetarian options as well as the usual carnivore stuff. The chips brought to our table were warm and fresh, along with two bowls of salsa. The mild one was just that. Mild. No spice at all. The hot was well peppery. I was able to mix one into the other to make one that was \"just right\" though it was still not the chunky style I prefer.\n\nThe food was served promptly and accurately. The rice was fresh and not crunchy or stale at all. My friend totally demolished his Texas-style burrito - I was sure he was about to start licking the plate!\n\nVery convenient, right off the highway at Carowinds Blvd. Great prices. Good drinks.\n\nWould I return? Absolutely!
1 ||| Craving Chinese, so we went back to this location today. Chow Mein bowl is threads away from being empty, but do you think they were making any? NO. Same thing happened the last time I was here. I think they may need to install some type of monitor to let the cooks know when the Chow Mein is almost gone. The young lady serving the food was very nice, but she was literally doing everything while the 2 cooks  just stared at the food cooking...and by food, I don't mean Chow Mein. When we first got there we were the only ones in line. By the time we left there was a line 7 deep...know what they were waiting for? CHOW MEIN. To the owners/managers of this particular franchise. You really should read what people are writing. The food tastes good, but honestly I will drive a little further to get better service, or at least Chow Mein that is made with some forethought.
2 ||| This restaurant is always packed with people and I have frequent this establishment serveral time over the years. It ihas great casual dining with large portions of home style food.  I was introduced to something new on the menu I have never noticed before, the Wisconsin Walleye 10-12 oz filet of this fresh water delicacy. It is offered in 3 ways: traditional corn meal breaded pan fried, broiled with citrus glaze or our house specialty \"pecan crusted.\" includes your choice of two sides for $20. The fish was delicious BUT, stay away from the breading, it over powers the delicacy of the fish. Unfortunately, I had to send it back because I ordered it with the \"pecan crusted\" coating.  Order it BROILED! The Broccolini side dish was tasted wonderful and cooked al dente to perfection. I am coming back for that same dish broiled.
0 ||| Bad service, bad cars, not recommended. Three sleepy mumbling representatives behind the counter and an exceedingly long line that is not moving. Finally I get a car whose wheels go cloink-clink-clunk so I didn't dare to go anywhere with it. I exchange it for a car that has no functioning outlet so I can't even use my GPS. Total failure.
4 ||| One of the best pizzas I have eaten. Soft, crispy, a little burned on top. Absolutely delicious! 10\" for 8 bucks and 22 oz Coors light for $3.50, what a deal!
0 ||| i've been to this office before (last year for my daughter), and my experience was totally different from today. to preface, my daughter has an egg & peanut food allergy, is allergic to: cats, grass, several types of native weeds, almost every tree pollen in north carolina, etc. poor kid has the hardest time in spring, i have to be vigilant about keeping her in while kids are wanting to run amok in the beautiful weather.\n\nlast year, we saw dr. patel--who was/is awesome btw. however, he no longer works at this office. he moved to the ballantyne office, which they did not tell me when i had called to schedule her yearly follow-up for a new epipen. they just said he left. ok. so i schedule with a different doctor on a date that worked with my schedule. i got dr. klimas. i gotta tell you. he might as well have been a character from a dark comedy. he was outright awful.\n\nfirst off, we had to wait almost 45 minutes in the waiting room to be seen. like another reviewer mentioned, they do have a sign stating that \"if you have waited for more than 15 minutes, see a receptionist.\" so i did. she told me the same thing. \"we're waiting on a room for you, someone will be with you soon.\" standard push-off. 10 minutes later, someone finally came to assist us. we were brought back to a room. nurse did some vital checks, and then we did the wait for our doctor. so another 45 minutes to an hour later--he finally came. \n\nnow i'm used to being mistaken for looking hispanic and i'm usually not offended by it, but when dr. klimas walked in and said \"hola\" to me--it struck the wrong chord with me. maybe it's cuz i had been waiting for so long, i don't know. i don't know what he was doing before he came in, but he obviously did not even look at my daughter's chart. he asked me questions that he should have already known the answers to, like whether or not this was a follow-up or one where they had to do tests. he asked if she had exposure to peanuts recently, and i wanted to say \"what do you think? pretty sure i know that if she eats a peanut, she might die. duh!\" then he calls my son, who is obviously bored and tired of being stuck at the office, a twerp. um, i know he's not an angel child, but i don't think it's right for some stranger to call your kid a name. to top it all off, he asks me about my  delivery due date for my new baby (which happens to be next week) and then asks me if i know that it costs $160k to raise a child. ok a-hole. i think i know what i am getting myself into. i don't need your insinuated opinion that i am making some kind of financial mistake for bringing another child into this world. seriously, i was so livid when i left the office i was tempted to change my son's dirty diaper and leave it open on the floor. i figured he would've expected it of me, since he was treating me like i was the idiot. \n\nsomeone tell me how you get out of paying for a useless appointment? waiting for an hour and a half for 10 minutes of wasted time...
2 ||| It doesn't match the layout of the other Barriques and the seating area is a little cramped and sparse.  Still serves the great coffee that I have come to know and love but unlike their other cafe's, the staff is a little surly and indifferent at times.
1 ||| Not really that impressed with this place. I ordered a large pizza and some cherry chipotle BBQ wings.\n\nThe wings were disappointing - the sauce, which I was hoping would at least be interesting, was pretty bland, and the meat didn't have much flavor.\n\nThey forgot to cut the pizza, which was kind of annoying. I tried a few toppings, half sausage and roasted red peppers, and half ham and olives. The sausage was pretty much just sliced hot dogs, and the rest of the toppings were not noteworthy. The rest of the pizza was equally not noteworthy.\n\nOverall, just overpriced and not that great.
3 ||| Had lunch here yesterday - yum.\n\nI had the tempura udon, which was very tasty, and the ever compelling spam musubi.  I can't stop myself.  I make musubi at home, but whenever I see it on a menu, I am COMPELLED to order it...  \n\nOverall atmosphere is typical of a family-owned business.  A little non-descript, small, clean... very one-on-one communication, great food.  But, it was also HOT.  Like, humid hot, which made me laugh, because it reminded me of being on the islands where the AC runs all day but the humidity takes over.  That was the only negative.\n\nThe owners were very friendly and the food was great.  I'll be going back... Prolly shouldn't order soup in the middle of monsoon season, but there's always that musubi!
0 ||| Cockroach on table (and a neighboring table). Lamb super mealy. Wine bottle \"opened\" in back and then brought to table with cork from another bottle. No apologies. Just arguments. You've been warned.
1 ||| Walked in here on a pub crawl around Madison. Not impressed. The service was horrible, even at an almost empty bar. We finished our beer and moved on.
4 ||| Good price, super fresh food, very efficient staff (though I could get my food faster) considering there's almost always a few people ahead of you if not 10. I usually have greasy (tasty!) mexican food but these guys know how to give you something good and healthy so definitely recommend trying them out.
2 ||| It is better than 3 stars but not quite 4.  They have some pretty good dishes.  The vegi burger was amazing!
1 ||| The quality of the sashimi has been very poor the last few times we visited Shogun. We used to go once  a week but  it is doubtful if we will return anytime soon after three or four disappointing meals.
2 ||| Super Sicilian and the Meatball subs are amazing, the only draw back is the burnt bread funk you'll sport the rest of the day.  Not recommended for folks that claims they don't go out for lunch. :)
3 ||| BB&M is named like a law firm.  I think they did it on purpose - kind of funny.  I've driven by it numerous times and always thought it looked interesting, so when I had the opportunity to grab some lunch in the area I headed over.\n\nThe place is only open during lunch hours and they seem to do a lot of catering business (for offices).  They do have a pretty large in-restaurant dining area with table service.  Their menu is pretty extensive and includes a lot of delicious looking items.  I ended up getting a Turkey Rueben and it was delicious!  The also give a cup of their soup-of-the day to all dining in customers.  It's a nice little perk before your sandwich comes out!\n\nBesides the food, another standout was the service.  First, I did not expect and sandwich place to have tableside service.  Second, the waiter helping us out was really polite and energetic.  It was really impressive to see such amazing customer service.
2 ||| i go to this depot too all the time because it is right across the street from work. so when i'm done with my paying job, i drive across the street and can pick up stuff for my non-paying job. \n\npretty standard depot....unless you vigorously hunt someone down for help, you ain't gettin any.
3 ||| I still remember the first time I spotted this B Dubs.  I had just moved to town a few weeks before and couldn't believe it.  I knew if Vegas had a B Dubs, I could live here.\n\nI've been here MANY times over the last few years, and, with the exception of last March Madness when technical difficulties forced me to go across the street to Sunset Station sports book to view the UK game, I have never had a bad experience.  Their sauce really is the best restaurant sauce.  I'm partial to Spicy Garlic and Hot wing sauce.  I even buy the trio of sauces so I can make my own at home when I am budgeting.  Plus, I'm a big dork and I love buzz time trivia.  Don't judge me.\n\nI was here last Tuesday and discovered yet another reason to love this place: ELECTRONIC CORNHOLE!
1 ||| I wish I loved Mi Patio.\n\nI could walk here from my house. It's cheap and has a big menu. The margaritas are yummy and cost the same as pop. It's cute, inside and out.\n\nBut the food...? It's just.... so.... blah. And there's so much amazing Mexican food in the area, why in God's name would you settle for blah?\n\nEvery time my SO and I go by it, we look at each other, shrug, and say, \"I wish we liked that place!\"\n\nMaybe we'll give it another try sometime soon....
4 ||| If you like burrito's this is as good as it gets! Move over Moe's, Qdoba, Tijuana Flats and Sulsaritas you have nothing to compare to Phat burrito. I wish I was closer to Phat Burrito and could go there more because it is super tasty. I prefer the fish burrito with there lovely mango salsa that they put on it but you really cant go wrong with anything there. Its not the fanciest place by all means but they have a real relaxed atmosphere and the staff really seems to enjoy working there.
0 ||| Ordered last night. We live one mile away, took an hour and ten minutes to get the food delivered. The chicken tenders we ordered tasted like burnt rubber and were extremely dry. The chicken parmigiana sandwich, the chicken was disgustingly rubbery... The fries were also the crinkle cut fries and tasted like they were microwaved. Will NEVER order from here again. I used to speak so highly of Rosatis and their is just Zero consistency these days. Step up your game...
0 ||| I joined Fred Astaire in 2003 and went for as long as I could afford it.This dance studio is all about high pressure sales. I noticed that they really work on the lonely; widowers, divorcees, etc. They make you feel like you are part of their family and when you run out of money, drop you like a hot potato. I didn't even finish my last few lessons because of the hot/cold nonsense. Everything is very expensive and I know of other customers who went through their life savings just to stay a part of this group because they were lonely. It is very sad that people can earn their living taking advantage of others.\n\nThe dance instructors are very talented so I gave one star.
2 ||| With a recent move from the now defunct University Square, Paisan's boasts an excellent terrace overlooking Lake Monona.  The interior keeps the dark intimate booths from the old location with a nice expanded bar.  \n\nAs far as the food, the porta salad is pretty top notch.  However, the rest of the dishes are merely average.  The sauces are either too bland or too rich and the pizza, while adequate, isn't anything to write home about.
2 ||| Good daily specials for lunch and excellent portion for the price you pay. Service is also always spot on. If you work uptown, this is one joint where you can sit down to have a meal and be back at work within the hour, as long as you work within walkable distance from the restaurant. Gets busy during lunch, so I would suggest getting there a little early - has limited outside seating as well.\n\nI, for one, love the Friday special - Cajun grilled fish with rice and beans. Can never clean the plate unless I starved the morning of.\n\nNot quite the authentic French Quarter food, but still a decent place to have lunch at in uptown. Would have rated higher if food was more authentic instead of being ordinarily good.
2 ||| Tasty wings, plentiful beer, and good place to watch games.  The men seem to love this place.  It can sometimes be a challenge to find a seat on the patio but if you can, it is so much better than the restaurant (unless it is 110 degrees, of course).  They bring in all the games, so I can watch my Longhorns when I am in Tempe.
0 ||| 9:00am on a Wednesday. \n\nOne (1) cashier working the entire check-out area, including bagging & self-service.\n\nAll four self-service registers: blinking red. 2 customers looking around for assistance.\n\nThe lone cashier is swamped, processing a $300 grocery order from a mom who's debating whether or not her $5.99 bag of tangerines as rung-up were really $5.79. Then she uses a dozen coupons. Then she uses 2 gift cards. Then she wants her things bagged in a certain order. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm standing behind her with a box of donuts for my project team. For 20+ minutes. It's not the poor cashier's fault - the guy was flying through things and doing all that he could...\n\nAs I'm walking out, I notice 4 manager-types standing out front just chit-chatting about the weekend.\n\nWe're done, Copps. Never again.
2 ||| It is what it is...an open field with some storage-type buildings, porta-jons & parking lots.\n\nI've always known this expo to welcome festivals, home shows, gun & knife shows & the like.  Yesterday's visit actually brought me here to work the Oktoberfest.  \n\nVast land makes for plenty of pop up tents for beer samplings, food & merch vendors. The downside: even with the good amount of porta-jons, men still found the need to um, \"relieve\" themselves at the end of the woods. \n\nGetting in the venue seemed to work well; plenty of volunteers & staff showing you were to go.  Getting out wasn't so easy. All those volunteers & staff were no where to be found.  Therefore, there were a maze of taxis & people trying to get in to pick up intoxicated folks, while others were trying to escape the madness.
2 ||| Ten Year Customers here in a great neighborhood restaurant. Si Senors goes up and down in quality as they hire and fire their cooks.  Sometimes in just ok and last night was simply amazing.  Their rates keep going upand prices and the little things they do to save money is annoying;  A.) They turn down the air. No A/C in bathrooms.  B.)  Hire waitresses that know how to wait tables C.)  No Paper towels in bathrooms?   Rates are same as Abuelo's and El Zocalo's. Their food is good but cheaping out on the little things make me wonder what things are skimping on that I can't see.
4 ||| I had to find something to do with my time as I anxiously waited for little Leela wonder puppy to reach the 12 weeks of age required before I could bring her home from the breeder. And since I had already purchased basically every product she could ever need or want, I decided to search for the perfect vet. I researched and interviewed quite a few places before settling on Animal Care Hospital. The fact that it is so close to me was definitely a factor, but I was impressed with this office regardless of location. I wanted to make sure the vet I chose would be a good fit for my Yorkshire Terrier, so I had plenty of questions to ask and Dr. Bishop graciously answered them all. \n\nAnimal Care Hospital has three practicing DVM's on staff, as well as 4 certified veterinary technicians. All 3 vets are members of the AVMA, AAHA, AzVMA and other organizations. Dr. Bishop is the Hospital Director who started the practice in 1973, Dr. Halver has been there since 1981 and Dr. Temple has been here since 2006. They use isofluorane gas anesthesia, which is the safest anesthesia, especially for toy breeds. They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature. Since almost every dog will be put under at least once to be fixed, it is good to know that they monitor vitals so closely. \n\nFor routine appointments, they schedule a full 30 minutes. Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. \n\nThe vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible. When I asked to deviate from the standard puppy vaccination plan and follow the veterinary protocol recommended by my breeder (a yorkie lover with 20 years experience breeding show and pet yorkies), she was accommodating and even excused herself to go print some info to re-familiarize herself with this particular protocol and permanently place it in Leela's file.
4 ||| Was VERY pleased with the work done here! After doing the alignment they drove the car to make sure it was aligned well. He wasn't satisfied with the alignment so he redid it. We drove the car on the freeway the next day and the alignment was GREAT!
0 ||| Came in with a hungry party of 18 and left with an angry and even hungrier party of 18.\n\nWe were seated quick cause it wasn't busy but we waited like 45 mins for only two appetizers then waited another hour for nothing! The waiters never cared to take away our dishes, refill our waters, or even apologize for the wait and let us know our food would be a little while longer. Instead of waiting longer because it was already 930pm we left and went to in n out for my uncle's birthday dinner.
0 ||| my kids call it \"low-quality inn\".  That's coming from a 9 yr old, and we all agreed.  Sheets slip off the bed in the middle of the night, mattress was lousy, breakfast - coffee was empty, waffle batter was empty, cream was empty.  I told the front desk guy and he eventually filled up on all, but he seemed to be the only guy working in the hotel, and he just didn't have the time to do everything.  Also, garbage was overflowing in the breakfast area.  Back to the room. . . tv was old - not a flat screen.  Only one bar soap for sink and shower, towels were flimsy and small and scratchy.   Room was hot.  Is that enough comments?  We were more than ready to leave in the morning, but unfortunately this was the only hotel I could find that had a room available since it was a football weekend.
1 ||| The service here blows. That is all!
3 ||| Yes, it's a chain. I support local when I can but damn, Papa John's is some good pie. \n\nOrdering a pizza is a 2-person job in our house- one to get the pizza, the other to hold the dog. The drivers are always friendly, though- our regular guy even knows the dog by name and talks to him when he drops by. Delivery is always on time, hot, fresh, and delicious. Both the roommate and I are regulars. (Can I say frequent pie-ers? Is that cheesy?)\n\nI love the online ordering and the daily specials. You also receive points for online ordering. I almost saw Jesus a few months ago when I came home from a 10-hour shift and found out I had enough points for a free pizza. You can also pre-tip when you order, saving me the trouble of having to scrounge up cash.
3 ||| I am so sad that Border's is closing. :-(  This store is so much nicer than B&N.   They have always had such a great selection of books, CD's, DVDs, games, greeting cards, etc.  I liked the little cafe a lot too.  \n\nGet by there quickly if you want to pick up some deals on clearance items, I am not sure when the last day will be.
0 ||| This place is absolutely horrible.  Worst service ever.  What's worse is the manager didn't even care when we brought it up.  Also, food sucked.  I saw someone reviewed it as El Suckalo- I agree.
4 ||| First of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESE-style sushi house. If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture, this will not be the restaurant for you. \n\nJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra, you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans and we southerner's especially, are not used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better service.\n\nThe food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice. If you are not accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan's (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.\n\nI have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent and the food is always excellent. I have never gotten \"brown wasabe\" or fish that I didn't know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.\n\nI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you, maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashi's great food. If great service is most important to you, find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House.
2 ||| I don't see it as a convenience for pay at the pump  when you have to go inside and present your card to get a receipt .  Every pump has a small sign on it that says you have to go inside if you want a receipt.  Not so bad but every time I've been here its another wait for the person behind the counter.\n\nOn a positive note, at least they don't post cash price and charge another price if you're using credit.
4 ||| I've been coming here for quite a while and it never disappoints. \n\nThe FOOD:\nThe sushi is amazing. They have fun roll specials every day - we've gotten all kinds of interesting rolls including angry shrimp, roly poly, etc. \n\nHowever, I really judge a sushi restaurant by its sashimi...and the sashimi here is some of the best. The fish is fresh, firm and delicious - never fishy, spongy or just ok. \n\nThe toro tuna sashimi literally melts in your mouth, and the salmon, yellowtail and friends are all excellent. \n\nThe REST:\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for such wonderful food. The service is consistently great, as well - I tend to ask a lot of questions and they've never steered me wrong. The atmosphere is dark and quiet - quite a nice departure from the club-like, house music and noise of some really good sushi places.
2 ||| Look past the overgrown weeds, and faded 80's exterior, and take a trip back in time, to the days when Sushi was an exotic delicacy, and a wise cracking Hibachi chef makes comically poor attempts to land grilled shrimp into your mouth..  \nUpon entering Ichi-Ban, I was fairly sure this was going to be a 2 star experience. The place hit it's heyday in 1986, I'm guessing, and the concept and decor are so outdated, it actually ended up being almost like a fantastic retro-dining experience for me. The food, was actually really good too! My previous experiences with Hibachi style Japanese places were LONG AGO, and were not very positive.  Aside from the rather surprisingly racist, and misogynist jokes the Hibachi chef made, I was shocked by how good everything tasted. I had the Calamari ($15.95) which was cooked very nicely right in front of me, and was absolutely delicious.  The simple broth, and salad served at the beginning of the meal were also quite delicious... I could drink the salad dressing by the glass. Super tasty, and everything was very fresh. There was so much Sushi, that I'm even going to list all of what I tried, but everything was fresh, served beautifully, and at the perfect temperature. While it may look practically abandoned on the outside, there's some surprisingly good food being served on the inside.
3 ||| Excellent lunch specials and the busy crowd during the work week proves it!  (The owners opened up a second location so that tells you something.) My boss and I went there many times for lunch when the mortgage office was just around the corner (so convenient). The entire costumed staff (in very ornate and eye popping colors BTW, so pretty) is very nice and take care of you right away (the growing line permitting of course). Seating is both booths and tables. The furniture, decor and ambiance is very pretty- carved dark rich woods. Although it is a busy place, you are not ignored here and every customer is just as important. Single bathrooms behind the beaded curtain might have you waiting in the hall but hopefully the wait is not too long.\n\nThe lunch special is a good size: tasty soup, a spring roll, a fried wonton with the dipping sauces, the entree (many choices- but my favorites were curry chicken, pad thai, & thai beef salad), and a bowl of white rice. And you could customize spiciness too- I like medium to spicy. I don't think I was ever disappointed here- never had an off meal. Two people could eat here for less than $20.00 including the tip- during the work week.  \n\nI introduced my husband to this thai restaurant and he liked it a lot. We're not in the general area a whole lot since my work place has changed (including the boss), nor is this restaurant close to our home, either. If we were in the area, I would love to eat here again.
1 ||| My husband and I recently ate at Radio Maria for dinner.  We'd had Sunday brunch and loved it at that time.  In all fairness, it started out wrong.  The employee seating us went to get us a table and was sidetracked by another employee at the entrance to the dining room and let us wait for at least 7 min. while he carried on an obvious flirtation/personal conversation with the other employee.  He finally looked away and saw us standing at the front door and that reminded him that we were still waiting.  I'm a relatively patient person but I was considering walking out at eating next door at Bacaro at that point - not because the wait was so long, but because we were so easily forgotten from the get go.  It was rude.The best I can say is that the dinner service left a lot to be desired (our waitress was tired and stressed) and the accoustics of the restaurant are such that larger tables are extremely loud, making it difficult to carry on a conversation in a normal voice.  The food was marginal at best although you have to give them points for creativity.  Wasn't a pleasant experience and my husband became very ill later that evening and lost his meal.  I wouldn't recommend it for dinnertime but may try again for brunch.
3 ||| I have to say that I wasn't excited about going.  I'm not a fan of big places like Outback, Claim Jumpers, and the like.  But I was so not prepared for this menu.  I had Halibut Cheeks...and they were SO delicious.  Our waiter, Jacob, helped it to be an enjoyable evening sitting outside on this beautiful autumn evening.  His brew suggestions were spot on as were his menu tips.  There was not one person at the table who went away with a full, satisified tummy and a big grin on their faces.  My husband had a delicious bourbon soaked salmon with sweet potatoe ravioli.  I can't wait to go back and I have a feeling 5 stars are in its future.
4 ||| Jose, Naira, and Kiyanna are always so welcoming.  Naira remembers me buying my house all the way back in 2010 and asked how it was and Jose was quickly to say hi how are you!  I only frequent the bank once a monthly maybe and for them to remember was pretty surprising and appreciated.
4 ||| As always I had a wonderful experience.. Ordering 8 rolls among 4 people is not ideal and a waste (of more table space than tummy space), but delicious and worth the $$. \n\nI do agree with previous reviews that there is some redundancy in menu but regardless, pick what you like and try it 400 ways... Love it..
1 ||| Called ahead. Dozen wings to go. Sure 10 minutes. Show up in 20 minutes. Oh they will be up in 5 minutes. Why? We like them to be hot out the door. That will be $8.53. Okay. Wings come up 10 wings. We ordered a dozen. Oh they don't come that way.  So why didn't you tell me these things when I called.
2 ||| It's a Starbucks like every other Starbucks, nothing to see here move along.   Although Starbucks in Paris sells mini dollar sized pancakes and man could I go for one of those.
1 ||| Got bad service from the scheduling people, they schedule patients for doctors who can't even help you even though they know why you were visiting.  And this is after they canceled the appointment on me and then rescheduled me for a doctor who couldn't even help me... Resulted in losing three weeks of treatment.\n\nIf you can find another clinic.
4 ||| Awesome Mexican Tienda Joint - super friendly staff, almost too many menu choices to choose from - I had what was recommended by the cashier - the steak fajitas - and they were incredible - I left stuffed with tender beef, guacamole, fresh tortillas, peppers, rice, beans, chips, salsa muy rica...  Format is super casual - you order at the counter and if you want to eat it there they bring it out to you in the seating area. While not expected given the format, drop in a tip and you can tell they really appreciate it. \n\nThey have an excellent salsa bar, and sell a wide variety of mexican beer, and it's priced  sooo right.  I'll be back for sure next time I'm in Phoenix.
0 ||| I have been reading recent reviews and note that several of them are less-than-complimentary. Looks like this place is continuing its downward spiral in food quality and quantity. We have some out-of-town guests and were planning to have dinner there tonight, but we have decided to find another place to eat instead. The last time we ate at Tokyo Japanese Restaurant, the BBQ meat was chewy and full of gristle and the salmon piece was skimpy and scrawny. Prices were the same, though. So obviously they are decreasing quantity and quality and they think the public doesn't notice! Keep this up and they will notice a drastic decline in business!\n\nUPDATE: Found a place to go! It's called Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse. Their prices are actually less than Tokyo's prices and I see so many positive reviews on Ohjah. Looking forward to trying them out!
3 ||| Just to be weird, I have only gone here for lunch. With Groupons.\n\nAll I can say is that a) the burgers are good b) it's so blatantly anti-yuppie that its actually appealing, and c) I need a leisure suit and a mid-70's Dodge to do this place right.
1 ||| Overpriced food with shady looking waitresses. This antiquated concept chain needs to go away. If you want to look at boobs, have some self respect and just go to a strip club. If you want good wings...go anywhere else!
1 ||| I ordered online and was charged almost $40 and received only two items out of 6 that I ordered. Then was told by the delivery driver that there was nothing he could do. Once I asked him to call and please fix this, he told me that I had to wait for another delivery then he would come back to me. I'll never order online again because I do actually like the food... It was just unfortunate and irritating to be charged for something and not receive it.
0 ||| Went there for 2 problem the main problem was fixed but costly. Second problem said a/c composer need to be replaced 1200 dollars so had second opinion was actually the fan 165 dollars.   Nice that they checked for the real problem never going back there.
1 ||| This is an extremely smoky bar with terrible music. The atmosphere is not there, the music is so low that no one really talks. The food is just ok and the service is very mediocre. The crowd is in their 50's so their is not much action as most people are gambling. This bar needs a major facelift! I would probably not recommend it to anyone as there are better places to experience
4 ||| Adventure Bicycle Company always gives above and beyond service.  The owner Bill and his staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and incredibly helpful.  You wont find a better bike shop in the East Valley.
3 ||| Only really looked through the dress section - which was clean and well organized.  It's in the Tatum Desert Ridge shopping plaza and there are a lot of good stores here.  Was able to happily walk out with 2 new dresses and the cashier was very friendly.  No complaints here!\n\nOverall: A
4 ||| American Eagle is amazing! Cute clothes, amazing quality, good prices, and super friendly associates :) heehee
1 ||| I am not sure what the hype is.  I went here based on its recommendation in the who's who of restaurants publicized in the So Scottsdale magazine.  It was mediocre, and the ambiance reminded me of eating at Disneyland, you knew it was make believe but you wanted to believe.  I wanted to believe this was going to be a great meal, but instead it was lack luster.
0 ||| Zenith Antiques gives vegans everywhere a bad name. I went here because it's recommended as a \"great vegan spot in Pittsburgh\" while nothing could be further from the truth. Is the food vegan? Sure. Is it decent? Absolutely not. \n\nIgnoring the fact that it the \"antiques\" that are barricaded sloppily in the space are actually similar to donations that Good Will recieves/sells (and that it smells like a musty old Good Will store), the last time I went here (December 2012) to try to dissuade me from hating this place, someone was smoking a cigarette inside at one of the tables. Pardon me for trying to avoid ordering COPD with a side of lung cancer while at brunch. DISGUSTING. This is not a night club, if it were, I could potentially ignore this transgression and chalk it up to \"he was so wasted, he lit up a cigarette.\" This is obviously an acceptable standard at Zenith Antiques, and consequently the atmosphere and the food stinks.
4 ||| Great place for some great Mexican food. I have been to both this location as well as the one in mesa and both are great. The food is great and the happy hour options are endless. I love eating outside the few times a year we can and they have a great area. TV's misteres, and heaters. Great for all year round.
4 ||| I love this place. I've been working at this mall almost a year, stopping by here for a drink or sandwich or snack quite often. They are always so nice and the food is fresh. If I have to wait a few minutes it's okay, I know they are preparing  it right then. Today I went in for a meal. While waiting for my delicious #1  I met the nicest lady. Her name was Jeannette(sp?) and I'm pretty sure she was in management or marketing. She came out of the back of Chick- Fil- A with the owner I think. As soon as she saw a customer she ran right up to him to take care of his needs. I just wanted to say I thought that was cool. There were plenty of staff around to take care of him, it was just automatic to her and I think that speaks volumes about her character. We had a nice chat and she told me about some upcoming promotions she was doing. A couple of things were for kids. Please support this great franchise and help them help the community!
2 ||| This review is for the new location in Scottsdale. \n\nIt was Saturday afternoon and I was starting to get hangry. (You know, hungry and angry.) I couldn't decide where I wanted to eat and that meant my poor husband had to make a decision. Driving around downtown Scottsdale, my husband saw a new restaurant with bright colors and decided that would be the place. Unfortunately, there wasn't any parking out front, so he drove around back. After we got out of the car, he saw Au Petit Four and knowing that I love French food, decided to take me here. \n\nWe didn't look at the menu posted outside, just walked right in and were slightly confused. The space is rather large and sectioned off into two areas - a bakery on one side and a restaurant on the other. A man and a woman were behind a counter in the restaurant side and asked if we wanted to sit down and dine. My husband said yes and we were seated in the completely empty dining section. In the entire building, it was just the two employees and my husband and me. (Awkward...) There was plenty of seating and open space. The walls were brown brick with pictures of Paris scattering the walls willy-nilly and all tables were covered with plastic red and white checkered table cloths. I didn't particularly care for the table cloths because they stuck to my legs. \n\nAfter looking at the menu, I shook my head at my husband saying I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat. After much indecision (the poor waitress had to come back a few times) I finally decided on the prosciutto sandwich and my husband ordered a savory crepe. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, I went to the bathroom. It was down the long entrance hall, passing by several open doors to the kitchen/storage closets. The bathroom was in dire need of some cleaning and restocking (barely any soap and I used the last paper towel). \n\nWhen I got back to our table, it was only a few short minutes before my sandwich arrived and shortly after the crepe. My sandwich came with the option of salad, chips, or pasta salad. I went with salad. The salad was basically mixed greens and salad dressing on the side. (The salad dressing was good, but I expected tomatoes or something else on the salad.) The sandwich itself was really good. The prosciutto was thickly sliced with even larger slices/hunks of slightly melted brie. There was also pesto spread, tomatoes, and lettuce. Overall, I loved my sandwich. The bread was fresh and really hit the spot. \n\nMy husband said he liked he crepe, but he only ate half of it. I tried a bite and preferred my sandwich much more.\n\nOverall, the only good thing in the entire experience was my sandwich. The fact that there weren't any other diners during lunch, the bathroom was lacking, and the \"just ok\" crepe, I can't say that I will be back. There are plenty of other places to get fantastic crepes and fantastic sandwiches. \n\nPerhaps their desserts are amazing?
3 ||| kaneya rules. its pretty small, but never more than 2 tables being used in this place. i think it's owned by a husband and wife, husband is the sushi chef. pretty good menu, really good sushi, amazing prices. usually only spend around $30 with 2/3 people.
3 ||| We were looking for food late night on Thursday and nothing was open.  Since we were staying at spring hill suites we thought we'd give it a try. We were afraid it would be expensive. \n\nFlipped menu to sandwiches.  Had a burger or turkey burger or hot dog or chicken sandwich with side for $9-10.\n\nWe thought that was good and we had no other late night options.  Food came out hot and fresh. My chicken sandwich was grilled nicely with plenty of juice left in. Homemade chips as side.\n\nPlace was large and clean. Pirates out of town so we walked right in at 10am on a Thursday night. Full bar but we didn't order anything.
0 ||| I've always wanted to try this place since it's been around for as long as I have lived in Matthews, but I never had an excuse to go...  Kinda glad I've avoided it until now.  Went here to grab a drink, was not greeted at the door... so we sat at the bar - looks like they have a lot of regulars, but we had to almost had to shoot a flare gun to get our orders in.  After that the bartenders made a disgusted look when the saw our tab and the apparent \"tip\" he deserved for 2 seconds of twisting the cap off a bottle.\n\nI may give this place another try, but for now... bad taste in the mouth will make me think of other places to go before this one.
0 ||| This is for a to-go order.  I hope for Chili's sake that the dine-in experience is better, but after this experience, I don't think I'm willing to find out.\nI ordered a grilled chicken on black beans, rice and pico de gallo with crispy tortilla strips from the \"lighter choices\" menu.  Here's what I actually received for $10.79:  A cold, dried out piece of chicken breast atop crispy tortilla strips.  No beans.  No rice.  No pico de gallo.  What the hell?  We also ordered the California Grilled Chicken Flatbread appetizer.  This was cold and chewy versus hot (I even would've been happy with warm) and crispy.  All of the food was cold, and we only live five minutes away.  If you should decide to risk placing and paying for a to-go order at Chili's, make sure you open all the containers before you leave.
3 ||| I did go back and had the enchiladas plate which was what you'd expect but yummy and filling.\n\nGood if you got the craving for mexican food. Easy on the wallet too.
1 ||| What's worse than spending 2.5 hours laid over in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport en route from SAN to PDX? \n\nArriving at gate A25, walking all the way to scheduled gate B10, hanging out in a bar nearby to wait out the 2.5 hour layover, Paying over $8 per beer, then discovering, right as the plane is supposed to be boarding, that the gate has been switched back to A23, and having to run the distance all the way back to A23, which happened to be 2 gates away from where I originally arrived (see hi-res image linked above). \n\nThanks for making me run some useless laps.
3 ||| The concept of a drive through oven chicken for breakfast establishment was almost a complete culture shock for me.  Who puts chicken tenders in the oven and roasts them up for breakfast?  It's Bojangles, we do!  It wasn't breakfast it was freakfest.  Food was good, but a little bit out of the ordinary. \n\nThe vats of sweetened and unsweetened ice teas were sort of ordinary vs. other drinks I have had but at least it was fresh and not foul.  They appear to not believe in ketch-up here YET. But boy do they love their cherry pop. I mean soda, but they refer to it as their pop. Cherry pop that tastes like toothpaste. \n\nYea! Next time I'll just be having water. And maybe invest in my own ketch-up. \n\nMad props for the FREE WIFI. my QWERTY now has more than a little bit of complimentary chicken grease on it. Probably was a good thing they didn't have ketch-up, or else my laptop would be having it.
1 ||| Why do I hate Redbear's? Let me count the ways. If you aren't a pretty lady, the bartenders aren't interested. Not for small talk, a menu  not for info on the food, not for info on a drink or beer, or for that matter, I couldn't even get the bartender's attention to pay my bill. But you can bet I had his attention when I left him 17 cents for a tip. My bar bill was $9.83 and I gave him a two fives, and I looked at him and said keep the change. If looks could kill I'd be down the street at Slater's Funeral Home. \n\nThe food? Meh, I've had better, why this place does such a rockin business I'll never know. Stay out after say dinner service is finished as the clientele becomes, shall I just say....shady. There are much better places to spend your hard earned money.
3 ||| This is probably some of the best drunk food in the strip, neck and neck with Primantis.  I used to eat here a good bit working locally, but it kind of became too heavy to eat for lunch.  Their portions are fabulous and they have or at last had a great lunch special, Italian sub, fries and a drink for like 8 bucks.  Not bad, but you could seriously split it, because you will be sleeping when you get back to your desk.  Great stop on occasion, but too much for a regular stop.
3 ||| I love this little place.  Good food, decent sushi, friendly service, and tasty thai tea.  Prices are good, and there's never a wait.
0 ||| Terrible food, terrible prices, terrible service. I'll never eat here again or order room service from the stratosphere hotel since this is the kitchen that supplies it.
1 ||| My biggest gripe with this place is that the prices are so far out of whack with what you get.\n\nThis is a family owned strip mall restaurant that would be quite a find if the prices were about half of what they are.  The food here is pretty good but not the best I've ever had.  The place looks and feels like a budget Italian restaurant (plastic tablecloths, paper napkins, cheap furniture, cheesy decor).  The portions are pretty small too -- I'm a skinny guy but I was still hungry when I finished eating.  And yet, dinner for two (just two pasta entrees + soft drinks) cost north of $40 before the tip.  And yes, that's no appetizers, no salads, no deserts, and no exotic ingredients.  Just not worth the price they're charging.
4 ||| Everyone was very nice here. Quick to help and on time with appointments; no waiting here very organized. I was alone and on crutches they brought the paper work to me and my CD of x- rays when finished. In and out in less then  1 hour.\n\nPay cash and get deep discount!
0 ||| Food is just like any other Chinese restaurant.. greesy and loaded w/ msg\n\nService here is a NEGATIVE 5. After being seat by the host a server comes along 15 mins later and took our order. Right after that the owners comes to our table and demand us move to a corner table so they can seat a bigger party. \n\nSave your money and go to Panda Express
4 ||| By far one of the best spots in Phoenix!  After going here at least 12 times each month over the last 3 years, my wife and I are still loving every meal!  The bar area has a cool vibe and the happy hour deals are great.  Ownership is constantly improving the concept of PCG which secures this restaurant as our favorite in town.
1 ||| I simply feel like there are far better Thai food restaurants in Madison. \n\nI've tried the pad thai here twice, at both locations and have been disappointed twice. Too much sauce and it was too sweet both times. My significant other loves their pa-naeng and even he admits it is hit or miss. I once tried the Tom Yum Talay Hang and was really impressed. However, one meal out of 10 is not what I'm looking for. I'd rather go somewhere in town where the odds are better.\n\nTry Lao Lang Xiang or Sala Thai for great thai food in Madison.
3 ||| I can't believe I sat lakeside, outdoors yesterday in the middle of February, while enjoying a fabulous meal with friends without freezing to death!\n\nYes, Marche Bacchus has an enclosed outdoor patio with a fireplace and heaters, yet the \"walls\" were clear so as not to obstruct the view of the lake. My friends and I showed up at 3:30, which is right in the midst of their light bite menu, so our dining options were very limited, just appetizers and salads.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, you will pass through their little wine shop. I always pick up a bottle in the store and bring it to my table to drink with my meal for a $10 corkage fee. Being the cheapo that I am, I always go for the cheapest, or shall I say least expensive bottle that I can find. I mean, it's always good, right?\n\nWe ordered escargot, which was amazing in a delectable garlic butter sauce - it reminded me of my favorite shrimp scampi. Next came the asparagus soup, which had the consistency and appearance of Gerber \"peas\" baby food, but luckily the soup had a wonderful flavor and the bacon and chives sprinkled on top made it that much better.\n\nThe Crab Louie Salad could have had more crab meat on it as I barely tasted any. A large amount of avocado is sliced on top and a French type dressing and capers rounds this salad out nicely.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the bread pudding which was out of this world. I think I'd go back here just for a glass of wine and bread pudding. My friends tried the flourless chocolate cake  (which by the way was gluten free) that was drizzled with a raspberry sauce and the cr\u00e8me brulee, which was prepared traditionally.
1 ||| The food is fairly good.  That's why it's such a shame that the service sucks!  Every time I have gone there, they take forever to bring you water, take your order, bring out food, everything - even when you are the only people in the entire place.  They are always unfriendly.  Out order has been incorrect on a couple occasions.  I really wish they had better service.  I just won't go there anymore because of that.
3 ||| I like this place. Although it gets really busy around noon. My favorite dish is gapraogui. I love how the kitchen is visable, while you are dining, and you dont smell like the kitchen when you leave. I mostly go for the food, its not a place I would hang out there with people and drink.
4 ||| Best take out Chinese in East Madison.  Food is always fresh and well cooked.  Sometimes you have to make sure they didn't forget the rice - mainly when the woman who typically works the front counter is not there.  I have always found the service to be friendly.  Periodically, I have  even received free chicken dumplings or a soda.  By far the best Moo Shu I have found in Madison after living here for 15 years and trying several of the more upscale places in town.\n\nFYI, there is a small seating area here but it is mainly a takeout place.
0 ||| I would give this place -5 stars if I could.  The only decent thing about this place is the food.  The pulled pork and chicken is out of this world.  This place is a complete dive, though.  The owner/manager seems to not care about service or customer complaints at all.  \n\nI took my parents out to dinner for Father's Day.  We had a party of six when we came to The Pitts Again and it took us 30 minutes to get seated because there isn't a manager on the floor making sure that tables are being bused or that the customers are being taken care of in a timely manner.  The service is by far the worst that I have ever had dining out.  The servers are inattentive, uncaring, and speed isn't even in the vocabulary of this place.  It took us two hours from the time that we arrived until the time we left.  Plus to add insult to injury they stuck me with an 18% gratuity for service that was pitiful.  I went ahead and paid for it not to make a scene and ruin Father's Day for my Dad.  Later that evening I called asking for a manager and was told that he was currently busy at the moment so I left a message for him to call me back.  I never received a call back so I decided to email them to express my disappointment of having to pay 18% gratuity to a server who in my eyes didn't deserve it at all.  This is coming from a guy who was a server all through college so I know what it's like.  Let's just say that it is now the end of July and I still haven't received a call nor a response to my email which leads me to believe that the owner doesn't care a bit about the customers.  It makes me sad because I refuse to ever go back due to the way I was treated even though I have to say their BBQ is the best in Arizona.
1 ||| I mean its a McDonald's, so expect McDonald's type of food.  \n\nThe only reason I am reviewing this sub-par McDonald's is to note that their breakfast burritos suck.  \n\nI don't mean to make this personal, but whoever they've got back there may be an expert at flipping burgers, but doesn't have a clue about rolling burritos. \n\nOn a positive side, they support the local area by having different community events such as McTeacher night in which teachers from a local school volunteer for a few hours with proceeds going back to schools.  \n\nIf you have to go here for breakfast, stay away from the breakfast burritos!!
3 ||| Very nice newer Hampton Inn. We were given an upgrade to a suite at check in... the Hilton Honors perk paying off there...and the extra room was very welcome. The rooms are quiet and spacious, and I like the layout of these new properties. The closet was the biggest I have ever seen in a hotel room, and the bathroom is 2 rooms, at least in the suites. The fitness center is small and barely suffices with only a treadmill, elliptical and one bike, but I managed to get a work out in both days. Breakfast is on the house at Hampton, but I usually go elsewhere, so can't comment on it. Overall a very nice, clean property, with above average service, and a good location near the U of I.
2 ||| Shopping center with all the trimmings. They have everything that's required by \"Shopping Center Law\" - a supermarket, a hardware store, a post office, a bagel/coffee shop, a hair salon and if you look really close in the back, they have a shoe repair shop and a dry cleaners.\n\nEven though they have adhered to the Law, they have exceeded the number of speed bumps that should be permitted in such a place. Bam! Bam! Bam! They keep the speed down, which is a good thing because the pedestrians tend to not look for cars and just step out into traffic. Then there are the drivers who don't look for pedestrians. I'm talking to you, elderly lady in the land yacht!\n\nYou can park and pop into the post office, or you can use one of the drive-up mailboxes.\n\nGetting out can be a good time. It's well worth your effort to drop down to the lower exit where there is a traffic light.
3 ||| \"Eat when you're hungry and eat 'til you're happy\"...one of the rules I live by:)\n\nOne of the simpler rules, really...so much less difficult to deal with than other rules:\n\n* \"Neither a borrower, nor a lender be\" - sure, great advice when the economy is in the crapper, but you might want to think about levering up in boom times:)\n\n* \"Do not covet thy neighbor's wife\" - Hey, if I hadn't done a little coveting, the Beautiful Carin would not be my blushing bride today:)\n\n* 9.80665 m/s2 = 1G - It's not just a good idea, it's the law (probably...in this universe:)\n\nAnd so it came to pass that I was, in fact, hungry after my run and before I hit the driving range yesterday...one of my buddies called and suggested La Tolteca.\n\nI said \"Who?\"...The Toltec?\n\nBut Wes seems to know his Mexican food and I seem to enjoy decent Mexican food, so off I went...to a really interesting part of town:)\n\nI guess I don't get out much...hookers ambling up and down the street at 11:30 am?...People urinating behind dumpsters in the parking lot?...The unmistakable (and appetite enhancing) aroma of ganga being smoked nearby?\n\nI don't see much of that from my deck in Old Town:)\n\nI also don't get tamales that are this good in Old Town, either...m'mmm, m'mmm good...with a great big side of atmosphere:)\n\nI chose wisely and thoroughly enjoyed my number 3...two plump, succulent and spicy beef tamales, covered with red sauce...I added a couple of little plastic cups of habanero salsa to my Styrofoam plate and headed for a table in the well muraled dining area (the murals really are nice...an artistic depiction of life on Van Buren, near La Tolteca...bright and colorful:)\n\nBTW, La Tolteca is a market and bakery, too!\n\nIf you happened to want...oh, say a beer or 4 at lunch, you can swing through the market and pick up a six pack of Bud for about what you'd pay for one beer at Loco Patron...and after lunch, you can grab a cupcake on your way out for about 95 cents (about 3% of what you'd pay for a crapcake at Sprinkles:)\n\nWes and I chatted and ate...the tamales were excellent...the company was excellent...I was charmed, by both La Tolteca itself (a sweet little outpost) and by the grittiness of this stretch of Van Buren (a street that gives us all a glimpse of how a post apocalyptic world might look).\n\nIt was worth the trip, for the food, for the look into another world and for a chance to catch up with my pal:)\n\nGo during daylight hours...park in the very safe \"hooker patrolled\" parking lot...avert your eyes from the public urination (\"ma'am...that's really not appropriate\":) and have a super burrito or a couple of tamales at La Tolteca...eat 'til you're happy:)
0 ||| Not only are the strings attached enough to hang yourself with, but the customer service was the worst I've experienced. They literally hung up on me when I said I wasn't interested at that price. \n\nFree hopper? Nope- it's cost you a monthly fee for every room. \n\nFree iPad? Kind of... To receive the iPad you are not eligible for the low rates on the channels- however, you are not eligible for the regular rates they post either.... \n\nTop 200 channels 12 mo deal: 39.99/mo\nTop 200 channels: Regular price 64.99/mo (doesn't exist!!!)\nTop 200 channels w/iPad 83.99/mo! \n\nGuess how much they want for HBO/Shotime?... $29/mo!!!!\n\nCox sucks too. I miss TWC and Fios from back east!
1 ||| I liked that this place was packed full of stuff! But at those PRICES I don't know how they stay in business! I heard good things about what they give if you sell..was very sad they weren't accepting clothes.(but I see why!)
4 ||| Sakana has been a home away from home for years. Have attempted to find a close comparison and can't....even somehow in Maui or Kauai. They always take great care of you, it is a very relaxed atmosphere and the sushi is amazing! How Fresh Wasabi could be #1 in my zip code is beyond me. Best to order family style as everything comes when it is ready...they don't let anything sit. Thank you my Sakana family:)
0 ||| Just had a horrible experience at this location. I RESERVED a car with a noon pickup time. Walked in around 12:08 and was greeted with a dirty look by the tired grumpy girl behind the counter. \n\nA few minutes later another guy walks in and says \"you realize we close at noon, right?\" No. I didn't know that. If you close at noon, why do you have noon pick up times?? So we show him our reservation and he states he doesn't have any cars. Ummmm. But I made a reservation. Isn't that the point of a reservation? Just stupid. \n\nJust ridiculous, very poor customer service at this place. Thanks for nothing.
4 ||| We love this place!!    We used to like to come in, when they offered up an all-you-can-eat (early-bird) dinner, that wasn't publicized, but we knew about it, and utilized it up to the last day of the program.  :)\n\nThey have THE BEST 99 cent margaritas ever!!  Plus, if you come in at a certain time, you can get appetizers for half-price.  A couple of chicken quesadillas, an order of guacamole, and 2 margaritas each, and we are out of there for under $19 - you can't beat that!!!  Plus really delicious chips and salsa, including a bean dip, that is pretty tasty!!\n\nOle!!
4 ||| This place is great! Literally it's businesses like these that Yelpers need to know about! Such great stuff at really low prices. Screw IKEA for inexpensive furniture shop here and get great stuff that nobody else will have. I can't even begin to list how many awesome pieces I've gotten from here but one of my favs is an beautiful oriental end table that was $15. Another time I got a vintage sign for $7 that people have begged me to sell to them (can't blame them, it's pretty cool). \n\nAlso, the staff is so friendly and nice but not in an annoying paid-on-commission-way- but in a we-love-our-store-and-what-we-sell kind of way. This place is nestled within a few antique stores but Everything Goes is by far the best. It can be overwhelming since there is a lot of stuff but try to focus on one thing at a time. Also, don't be afraid to buy a chair with ugly fabric or a dresser painted and ugly color; use Pinterest to DIY a facelift. I don't even live close but it's always worth the drive.
4 ||| I don't know what this persons problem is but Sharper Vision Eyecare is NOT what he is saying it is. The entire staff is perfectly friendly, the doctors are even better, they have an amazing selection of glasses, the wait time is good for an office setting, and they definitely DON'T push you on upselling. Yes, they do ask if you're interested in different eye tests and they list the price but once you say no, that's the end of it. My family and I have been going there for 8 years or so and we have never once been disappointed with anything. They always have taken great care of us and we've never had a problem with insurance. If I could give them 100 stars, I would.
3 ||| They do up to $50 cash back here, that's unexpected.  This was orig a tip but YELP wants me to review so based on that fact alone 4 stars.  On top of that if you need anything in a pinch like for travel or something its always a good place to go.  Plus you can get balloons here, who doesn't love balloons.  Price range here is literally one dollar sign #JOKES
2 ||| Some people on Yelp are making unfair comparisons regarding Hooters. \n\nI stayed here on October 18 & 19. The hotel / casino is older, and the rooms are in need of a remodel. The price of the stay, however, was very reasonable. One can't compare Hooters to, say, the Cosmopolitan, but $400 plus per night was not in my budget. If you want a beautiful room in a fantastic location, stay at the Cosmo. You get what you pay for.\n\nPlus side: Hooters is within walking distance to the Tropicana and MGM Grand, which makes it a convenient location. They have 24-hour security in the pool area and, of course, in the casino. I felt safe while staying there and walking around with $500 cash in my pocket.\n\nAnother plus: I gambled in the casino and especially liked the $3 blackjack. Impossible to find on the Strip.\n\nOverall, I'd give Hooters 2.5 stars. Two stars is too low, and three stars is a bit on the high side.\n\nJohn Howard\nPort Hueneme, CA
0 ||| I really Tried to give this company my business. I love the Pizza here!!! But I will not go to this place anymore!!! I really hate that the customer service. The lady put my wife on hold for a hour and still waited. I had my wife hang up and Call back to give them another chance too earn my business. So she calls and guess what happen next? You guess it, she told my wife to wait again, my wife waited a good 20 minutes. Wow I really think this place is disorganized on service. I hope this goes to the owner. Please. Retrain your employees at this location. This goes to the owner, when you open your first store you made sure to treat customers like gold. I hope the owner didn't forget that moment. Be ashamed. \n\nThank you,\nJason R. Wells
2 ||| I went to this place last weekend for a pedicure and although the staff was very friendly and competent, I was disappointed. I was wanting a relaxing experience, but I felt like it was rushed the whole time, and I was lifting this foot up, putting that foot down, rinsing, polishing, bam, bam. bam. It would have been perfect if it was billed and priced as an Express Pedicure. As a spa pedicure with extra scrub, I expected more than a 15 minute in and out rush service at full price plus. In all fairness, they were busy, but I would have rather been told I would have to wait or have to schedule an appointment.
4 ||| Great Italian food outstanding veal parmigiana... And it is Veal !!! Not Pork like some other places...Edy the maitr'e d is amazing portions are great. I truly recommend this place.
3 ||| It's the best pizza I've had in the Midwest. PERIOD! The slices are huge and thin like one's from New York but without all the grease. The crust is thin and light without all the dough. The toppings are creative and fun. I had a slice each of the Philly Cheesesteak, the Gyro and the BBQ steak with fries. All we're tasty. The staff is young and fun. You can buy drinks or there's a water fountain. A great college place to get an amazing slice without all the pretense. Just great pizza at a good price.
3 ||| I just really like the idea of this place. Sports and rock and roll? Who doesn't love that? The menu items all have clever names, some of which made me giggle. I was hoping the servers would be all Alice Cooper-ed out but they just a little bit of eye makeup on. The food is pretty cheap and they have drink specials every day of the week. We ordered the lobster quesadillas, onion rings, and a side salad. Everything tasted good and it was really filling. The service could have been a little bit better but I was so enthralled by the large televisions playing Sportscenter and all the concert posters on the walls that I didn't really mind. I definitely can see myself going here again after a basketball or baseball game.
3 ||| Phoenix is very fortunate to have such an awesome zoo. It is an awesome zoo that left a strong impression on me when I visited in 2004. Fast forward eight years, and we drove over 200 miles from Las Vegas to Phoenix to see it. The Phoenix Zoo is so awesome that if I had the power, I would trade the best Las Vegas casino for the Phoenix Zoo. Since I don't have that power, I will write a review of why the Phoenix Zoo is so awesome.Instead of repeating facts such as admission is $20, I broke the review into sections. Each section discusses the awesome characteristics of the sections of the zoo.\n\nTropics Trail\n\n  As Phoenix builds a bigger and better Phoenix Zoo, the temporary entrance is near Tropics Trail at the far right . This is where visitors get their first impressions of the Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are the elephant, jaguar, tortoise, iguana, Andean Bear, rhinoceros, anteater, flamingo, and manned wolf. \n\nChildren's Trail\n\n  The southeast section of the Phoenix Zoo is more than a children's zoo. Because it sits on the south side of water it is a hot spot for waterfowl viewing. On the path to the petting zoo is emu, bald eagles, an island showcasing siamang, warty pigs, and ocelot. The highlight of the Children's Trail is the Harmony Farm. Grownup children will also enjoy the Big Red Barn and windmill house.\n\nThe Main Lake\n\n  The Main Lake is the central right area of Phoenix Zoo where the walkways circle Main Lake. Besides the Main Lake; the highlight exhibits include Land of the Dragons, two islands showcasing lemur, otter, flamingos, and gibbon. For an additional expense there is a camel ride. By this time you might be hungry or thirsty. The Cavern Cafe serves decent food and soft drinks.\n\nAfrica Trail\n\n  The Africa Trail sits at the back center of Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are cheetahs, African wild dog, baboons, mandrils, warthogs, lions, and tigers.\n\nArizona Trail\n\n  The Arizona Trail is my favorite area of the Phoenix Zoo. It is here that a visit to the zoo changes into a hike into wild Arizona. The bighorn sheep exhibit is off the charts well done. The bighorn sheep exhibit incorporates a real mountain. This is the exhibit that leaves an imprint that Phoenix Zoo is awesome. It could be the best bighorn sheep exhibit in the country. Throughout Arizona Trail, natural Arizona treats the zoogoer to four star scenery and first rate pictures. It is the part of the zoo where bunny rabbits outpopulate wild animals. The Wild Arizona Trail, in my opinion is worth $10 of the $20 admission.\n\n  The Arizona Trail is discontinuous. To the left of the Zoo Plaza there is a more developed Arizona Trail. Here the highlight exhibits are bobcats, Mexican Wolf, Mountain lion, and pronghorn. This is also where the First Aid Station is located.\n\nThe Savanna\n\n  The Savanna is the center of the Phoenix Zoo. In the future it will be the main entrance. It serves as the plaza and savanna section of the Phoenix Zoo. Here you have Savanna Grill (my brother said there burgers are good) and Karibu Cafe. This is where the gift shop is. The main Safari Train Station is here. The highlight exhibit is a savanna showcasing giraffes, eland, and zebras. There is also a stingray bay.\n\nThe Exit\n\n  I left the Phoenix Zoo impressed. I was disheartened that it closes at 4 p.m. and that Las Vegas does not have a Phoenix Zoo. Headed to my car, it was time to explore more of Phoenix. Phoenix Zoo is near downtown Phoenix and Tempe, and Arizona Mills.
3 ||| I am duly impressed with your decent coffee, great vegetarian options and  free internet. I deeply love your hang-over cure wrap and constant parade of young people on a mission.
1 ||| I don't normally eat beef, but every now and then I crave chili-cheese fries. I ran across this diner, and thought I hit the jackpot.\n\nWrong.\n\nThese were the blandest chili-cheese fries I EVER had. How can you screw this up?! Deep-fry some fries, pour a can of chili and a handful of shredded cheese over the hot fries...boom! Done. Nope. Not here. I don't know what they did. Waste of 8 bucks!
3 ||| Very nice grocery store indeed. Everything is well organized and not messy at all. The fruits were definately of decent quality, well it better for the cost. This is one of my top grocery store for sure.
2 ||| Can't say it was bad. Its chicgo style so they cut pizza in small appitizer squares. And the regular is super thin like paper thin. The large pizza seemed small enough for 2 people at most. But that's okay the problem was after an hour it arrived cold. Sorry I don't like cold pizza. Next time ill have to try it at their shop. Hope they read this and find way to correct cold pizza issue. Its a ton better cold than dominos.
1 ||| Been here 3 times and was disappointed after the 3rd visit.  I went to pick up my pants and it literally took them 10 mins to find my pants.  Strike 1.  After finding my pants the guy told me the pants had not been alerted yet.  Strike 2.  The guy apologized and said it would be ready in about an hour.  I went back 3 hours later and waited again for another 15 mins to get my pants back.   No customers ahead of me, just told me that it was almost ready.   Strike 3.
3 ||| This place is what I expect from a Marriott. The staff is friendly, the rooms are up to date, and the stay was perfect. \n\nTo start with, I had a king room with a pull out couch. The TV location makes it so it is better to watch TV from the couch, but it does pull out if you want to watch from bed. There is also a small fridge, desk, and coffee maker. The bed is very comfortable being not too soft, not too hard, but just right. \n\nI also checked out the gym which has 2 treadmills, elliptical, and stationary bike. They also have some free weights and a water fountain. The nice this is each TV has its own TV with a full breadth of channels. There is also a moderate size pool that was tempting to jump in. \n\nThe most unique thing about the hotel is that there are two separate elevators, one for each side of the building. Smart idea. \n\nOverall nice hotel that is up to date and has multiple amenities. Good choice while staying in east Madison.
3 ||| I found a lot to do in this airport while waiting for a flight to San Antonio. \n\nThe wifi is fast, if you're into that kinda stuff.
3 ||| Phoenix is the most efficient large size airport I've been to. Security moves pretty quickly. It can be overwhelming with all the different terminals. I fly southwest mainly so I just remember that southwest is Terminal 4. There are plenty of restaurants (good ones) to choose from. My favorite coffee stop is the Peets Coffee right after security at D gates, simply because the drinks are delicious and there are plenty of lounge chairs and charging ports. There are a lack of charging ports in the D gates which is a downside for me. Also the other thing to remember is if you are renting a car, the shuttle ride to the rental car center is about 10 minutes so be prepared early so you have a little bit more extra time. With water bottle refilling stations and good eats, I don't mind layovers at Sky Harbor at all!
4 ||| It's about time I review the Elephant Bar. This place is reasonably priced and has excellent food. I love their Wok Kitchen creations. Who would have thunked it, but the Elephant Bar has the best Chinese food around. As many times as I contemplate trying something different, I always default back to the Shanghai Cashew Chicken ($11.75). The portion is huge and served with white or brown rice. My wife usually devours the Kung Pao Shrimp. \n\nTheir happy hour food is reasonably priced, I recommend the Sliders. They have plenty of TV's to catch the game. Although service in the bar area can be unpredictible, the restaurant service is always excellent. Be prepared for the crowds on the weekend.
2 ||| There doesn't seem to be that many Korean places in Charlotte... I know of maybe 4 or so, and driving up to China Wing you'd never really guess this has some of awesome Korean fare. From the outside it looks like yet another crappy, MSG-ridden, over-sauced American-Chinese hell hole. Even when you walk inside, you're still not totally sold you walked into the right place... \n\nBoy, are YOU wrong for thinking that! I've been here twice and both times I've been very impressed by their Korean food. I don't know how their Chinese or American dishes are since I never get them, but the Korean dishes are great!\n\nThis time I had the Dolsot Bibimbap and it was very well serviced. The cute cashier asked me if I'd ever had it before, to which I lied and said no. She gave me a very nice and friendly lesson on the dish, the name and what it means all while practically prepping it for me and serving it. She stirred my pot (no pun intended) and suggested how to eat it and what not. Very nice.\n\nBefore my Bibimbap arrived they bring out a bowl of shredded chicken soup, some kimchi and this sweet pickled radish with sugar which was out of this world.\n\nSo, all in all, it was a great visit, great food, great service and great info.\n\nBut let's knock off a couple stars.\n\nOne because I've had better Korean food and because when you first walk in, you can get a little confused between the Chinese and Korean and hamburger signs on the wall.\n\nThe second star was lost (and I'm being nice here as I usually knock off two stars for this sin) because they serve you unfiltered water. I HATE IT when a restaurant serves me unfiltered water. It's disgusting and unclean and it can ruin your meal. I only took a sip and thought about sending it back. But figured the girl had been nice enough and the food was good enough that I could do without.
0 ||| Our very presence in their lobby was an inconvenience to them. The manager was extremely rude when we asked for a table w out a reservation. No offer to wait just a blunt 45 min wait along with a snarky comment as we left \"do not take any more people with out a reservation\". Thanks for the rude interaction were headed to Cheesecake Factory.
3 ||| So Anna's has been around Charlotte for a long time, first over on East Boulevard where Sloan and a few other boutiques called home (great placement there).  Now they have a much bigger space just off Park Road, and next to a major bridal store (great placement x2).  They simply have a great reputation for competent and speedy work and my experiences are happily consistent.\n\nAs a guy who wears a full suit 5 days a week, a good tailor is a necessity.  The ladies out front at Anna's may not have perfect English at all times, but they have the skills when it comes to tailoring a suit.  Pants hemmed to perfect specification with cuffs, no problem.  Waist taken in, spot on.  Jacket pulled in, we do that. Jacket cuffs taken in, got you there too.  \n\nYou just slide into a dressing room and then walk out and take the box stand for a quick measurement and marking.  Minus a star for the mirror and box being right in the middle of the store and facing the parking lot.  Modesty takes a back seat here.  Luckily, I think the ladies taking the measurements have seen it all and take it in stride.  If only the other customers did so as well.\n\nTurn around time is also fantastic.  I recently had 3 suits altered within 3 days.  I thought that was insane- especially if you have ever tried in-store alterations.  Prices are all well within line for usual services- hems to pants $10.  Waist tucks $10.  Special requests and services are more expensive, though, so just consider what it is you are asking for.  Overall, great place for professional and speedy tailoring work, this Charlotte long-timer has earned it's place in my go-to book.
3 ||| I had just had a small Birthday gathering for my sister there, we won this package through an email contest.  Liz who handled everything was really nice and friendly and the server we had was top notch. I don't make it over here much because I moved a bit far away but it is a great place to watch sports, play pool, drink, and eat some pretty good food.
4 ||| It is well worth the drive for me from Central Phoenix to Arizona Mills for this little gem in Tempe what I spend it gas I make up in dividends in savings. I have gotten three pairs of my favorite designer jeans there now at literally 1/3 of the normal price and I didn't have to fight off an orc to get them. As a matter of fact the day that I went was like I had the run of the store and I was shopping alone. For all the many bad experiences that I have had in shopping in outlet stores Sak's made up for it with a wonderful shopping experience and great value.
0 ||| If you have never been charged for cleaning and minor repairs before another tenant moves in to your recently vacated apartment, then this is NOT the complex for you. The Heritage charged me for the following: removing a few plastic bags from the apartment, ($25), touch up paint on the walls when I had never damaged them ($32.99), carpet cleaning ($20), tile repair (I hadn't damaged them at all, $24.50). \n\nThe fact is, any apartment complex I have ever lived in cleans up and makes minor repairs before a new tenant moves in. That is just part of maintaining an apartment complex. I have never, ever, heard of charging former tenants for the minor clean up job necessary before new tenants move in. I in now way left the apartment a mess, and I was respectful of the space the entire (albeit short) time I lived there.\n\nI am very disappointed that I was charged over $80 for such things, and I am currently disputing the charges. \n\nOther reasons I would not recommend living here: the complex has some \"interesting\" characters walking around, and it smells like a fish packing plant at night on a fairly regular basis.\n\nIf I could give this place no stars at all, I would.
4 ||| ACE is the best shop in Charlotte, hands down - the best group of guys anyone could ever ask for.  Diverse specialties and serious professionals in their craft. Not to mention, just a great, honest bunch of guys who are always helpful, friendly, patient, and fun to talk to.  However, this place is NOT for for the fly-by-night pick something off the wall kind of crowd.  They DO have flash, but why would you chose flash when you have such a skilled group of artists at your disposal to craft a custom piece?  So, definitely GO to ACE, but take your time, decide what you want, call ahead to schedule an appointment, and be prepared to wait a little while until you can get in. BUT it will be worth the wait, worth the money, and worth your while...
0 ||| if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a \"Rock\" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.
1 ||| Meh, is right.  I've been wanting to try Vincent's since I moved to the area over a year ago.  I bought a groupon that I've been holding onto for way to long and decided that this was a weekend to go.  Honestly can say that I could have done without. \n\nOur first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.  I get that your a French restaurant, but no need to decorate like we're still in the 80's.  Liquor bottles as a display? Doesn't look good.  It should have felt like an upscale restaurant, but it didn't.\n\nI liked that their menu is constantly changing.  Some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.  My husband and I probably went with the least interesting choices.  I started with the lobster bisque ($8).  For our main courses it was lobster with basil linguine for me and beef tenderloin for him.  The lobster was just ok, the basil pasta was overcooked.  Mike's beef tenderloin was pretty good, but not worth the $34 price tag.  And none of the main entrees were under $32.  I get that you're a \"fancy\" restaurant, but those prices are way too high.  I have no problem spending $30 on an entree, but it better wow me.  We'll just say Vincent's left something to be desired.
3 ||| Korean Food + Me = true love.  I adore Korean food.  I'm not kidding. It's probably my favorite cuisine.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  My typical favorites are kimchi jigae (spicy tofu/kimchi/pork soup), Haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), Galbi (short ribs), oh jing oh duk bokki (spicy squid with rice cakes), Bibimbap (rice bowl with veggies and bulgogi), mul mandu (dumplings)... I could go on and on.  \n\nIf it's your first time with Korean food and you're not very adventurous, get the Galbi and JapChae noodles or Bibimbap (but be sure to try the side dishes (called panchan).  If you're in for the adventure and heat... see my list above! :)\n\nHope and dread were the battling in me when I left CA and realized I'd have to find Korean food here in AZ.  Turned out to be a needless battle though as the Phoenix area continues to surprise me with their hidden and limited but delicious, authentic fare...\n\nYum yum Hodori!  This was my first taste of Phx area Korean food and I have to say, I was impressed!  It's much better than I expected it to be.  They have an extensive menu so I ordered Bibimbap, Kimchi jigae, and Galbi.  It was all good.  The panchan was tasty, too.  I still crave LA Korean food sometimes but this was definitely good enough to return to, many time.\n\nSee ya there!
0 ||| My iphone 4s screen was broken and cracked on the front and back.  Got quoted $50 for each side so $100 total.  About and hour later they were done, however the guy that installed it accidently cracked the glass on the front during installation while pushing it in.  He said that was his last glass screen unless I wanted to wait a week.  He knocked $50 off the price and I paid half as the crack he made was internal and just put a small line through it from top to bottom that wasn't too noticeable and I needed my phone immediately as I was heading out of town the next day for a week.\n\nAbout 3 hours later I reach into my pocket for my phone and pulled it out.  As I take it out of my pocket the front screen and back screen both come apart!!!!!!  I noticed that the guy who repaired it forgot to put the screws back into the phone that hold it together! Who does that?!  Luckily I was at the Kierland Commons and walked into the Apple Store to see if they could replace the missing screws.  They did for free thankfully, did not expect that from Apple.\n\nNow after about a month of having the screen \"fixed\", their are two huge cracks running through the screen after my phone rolled off the couch and onto the carpet taking a massive 10 inch fall, haha.  I don't what they replaced my screen with but it has the durability of paper mache.\n\nThis should of been expected from a place that looks on the outside to be across between a pawn shop and a bail bond agency. Lesson learned, just awful.  You've been warned.  Take your chances with the Apple Store, atleast they replace the screen with Apple glass.
1 ||| Maybe it was an off day but 3 out of 3 things we tried just weren't that great. The view is AMAZING but the food was pretty mediocre unfortunately (Three strikes you're out!). It's probably better to just come here for drinks to be honest. At least the service was very friendly.\n\nChilean seabass with korean bbq preparation. It sounded great... but.. it didnt taste very impressive. When I think seabass I think flaky, buttery tasting fish. This was kinda dry and mostly tasteless. Maybe they cooked it too long, I dunno? But it didnt taste like anything special, ESPECIALLY for $39. Probably the worst seabass I've had to be honest.\n\nLobster mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was runny and just not that good. Usually mac and cheese is rich, gooey and tasty but not this one. It ended up with a bunch of watery sauce in the plate and while it wasn't terrible, it def was not good.\n\nFettucini with salmon. Of all the things this was probably the best... of the worst. It was ok. If it was 12 bucks id probably be like \"you know that wasnt so bad\" but it was nothing to write home about. My pasta ended up stuck together in a huge mass that practically needed to be cut to separate. The salmon chunks that came with it were ok. Nothing special.\n\nBasically I would NEVER eat dinner here again. They've won awards so maybe I just had an off night. Regardless, I just can't recommend you eat here. Come here and go downstairs and get some drinks and enjoy the view, skip the food.
4 ||| This place has the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  I'm sure people will argue in favor of some of the more well known places, but you can't beat this place.  Good, fast, friendly service.  Food quality is everything I want for breakfast - the meats are top quality; thick cut bacon, bulk savory sausage, thick ham steaks.  And God bless them, real salted butter on everything - nothing tastes quite like it.\n\nWith all of that being said, don't walk in the door expecting anything other than an urban neighborhood diner.  I starting eating here just out of convenience when I lived on Mt Washington but I still find myself making the trip back because I just can't find anything that compares anywhere else.
1 ||| But they are improving and the rodeo burger is back. Even with that though it is still the worst fast food around.
