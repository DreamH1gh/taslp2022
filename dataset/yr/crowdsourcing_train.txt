3 ||| I've seen better selection at other Charlotte Targets, but this Target will do.  Don't be daunted by the long lines; the management is pretty good about opening up new lines as needed and the lines generally moved faster than expected (unless you get behind an excessive coupon-clipping mommy !!!).  The customer service, like Diane D. noted, is hit-or-miss.  While weeknights are generally slow, this Target tends to be quite understaffed during the week.  Come on Target, you can do better!
2 ||| Food is good. Service is spotty. Drive through is always backed up, and is often not an option. \n\nTime to get your food in the drive through is INSANE. It makes no rational sense how long it takes.
4 ||| The food is good. Portion size is BIG! Wait-time during lunch hours is kind of long. Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly enough. \nDefinitely a recommendation.
4 ||| In the Nordstrom Last Chance parking lot, this basic pedi for about $20 + tip was not bad for being a walk-in trying to kill time! The interior doesn't have much flair, but my gal was nice and definitely knew how to engage in conversation just the right amount. She talked with her co-workers a bit, but also made me feel comfortable as I read my magazines, conversed a bit and just enjoyed it. \n\nI actually would have spent MORE money if they'd asked if I wanted a design or additional add-ons. However, it's nice that they don't pressure you into lots of $5 upsells. (FYI, I didn't see prices posted, so if you have questions, ask! But everything seemed very reasonable.)\n\nI'd come back if I was in the area!
4 ||| This is my girlfriend first  time here. We ordered the ham and cheese and bacon 6in it was very good. We will return.
0 ||| Awful! Floor was so dirty that my shoes almost came off due to sticky substance.\n\nAlso unruly teenagers have taken over this theater. It is no longer possible to enjoy a movie at this location. \n\nThis location is merely a babysitting service for parents to drop off their entitled, disrespectful brats. \n\nIn turn, they ruin everyone else's movie experience.
0 ||| When I first moved to Tempe this was one of the best places for a slice. However more recently they have been getting pretty bad in quality. I actually prefer some of the cheaper places in the area because their quality has gone down so much.
4 ||| Kids, if you take your mother here to browse you will know EXACTLY what to get her for holidays and birthdays.  The selection here is fabulous and varied. There's lots of fun things to buy for both yourself and any other bath-product loving person.  Additionally those that work here can take ANY scent you find anywhere (not sure about brand name perfume) and do wonders to copy it and then you can have you own personalized lotion, body spray, etc.
0 ||| I came here with a group from the university to talk and drink wine, and I was also hungry.  We ordered some wine and beer, but I wanted food too.  Even a snack, and the place is kinda upscale, so I expected some breads, cheeses, spreads, etc.,  but there is nothing edible.  Some overpriced crackers, nuts, or pretzels.  I got some out of desperation, but it was a mistake.  The location is good, and the environment was okay, but even without a kitchen they need to put together some kind of nosh plates and simple edibles to go with their wine and beer selection.  Duh.
0 ||| Used to love the Charleston location as a kid but noticed the quality going down over the past few years. I thought maybe they went through a change in owners but that wasn't the case. Pancakes aren't great anymore. A little too doughy. Service has always been bad at this location. Friends of mine also had an unfortunate run-in with the owner where she was so disrespectful that they left before they even got to eat. So not worth it when there are other great breakfast places around town like BabyStacks and the Egg and I.
4 ||| four stars seemed quite apt\nbut i moved away from town\nnow i use netflix
0 ||| This has got to be the WORST McDonalds ever. I will never go to this McDonalds again. Cashier repeated my simple order back to me 5 times, service was mediocre and I was just unimpressed.
0 ||| After reading the reviews of this place it reminded me that this was one of the first places I went looking for a dress over a year ago for my wedding. \nI had found a dress in a bridal magazine that was exactly what I wanted. I did some research and found that this was one of the only stores in town that could order this dress.\nI went into the store and was greeted by a really pushy sales lady. I told her what dress I wanted and they found it in the catalog and said they could order it. \nShe then said how they needed half of the money that day to hold the dress. I said \"I don't have that kind of money right now, so that is not possible.\"\nShe then said \"this is the dress you want, right?\"\n\"yes\" I said, \"but I don't have $600 to put down today.\"\nThe lady kept pushing to put money down. I told her that I could come in later in the week to put money down and she seemed very disappointed that I wouldn't give them money that day. She said she would call me the following week to check up.\n\nCome the following day, not week, the lady calls me asking when that day I was coming in. I said \"I'm not coming in today, I told you next week.\"\n\nAfter all the pushiness and the fact the dress cost way  more than I could afford was the reason I did not want to deal with these people.\n\nThe really don't seem to care about the customer, just the customers money. I would not recommend this place!
0 ||| I live off of Liberty Ave and everyone kept telling me I needed to try this place, so after 4 months I did.  When my wife and I walked in I thought, this place doesn't look too bad, actually kinda cool.  WRONG!  After being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table.  Our food took about 45 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast, but I though, everyone thinks this place is great, I guess I can wait for perfection. \n\nThe food gets to our table, it looks good, it looks like breakfast, but it is cold, well mine was cold.  So I'm sitting at the table, empty coffee, cold breakfast and quite pissed off, because of the situation and I'm hungry.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is, I tell her my food is cold, and I'm fine and don't need another plate, we had already been there over an hour, we had placed to go, ya know.\n\nWhen the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off, she says, I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really?  should I have to?).\n\nWife's food was hot, but she thought it to be just average breakfast.\n\nI never want to go back, but I will, because I always give places another shot.\n\nTerribly slow service (server was very nice though, probably home from college), and food took forever.  I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis, because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded.
0 ||| Are all the UPS Stores the same?  If so they all charge $39.37 to pack and ship a boxed item to Arkansas.  $15.45 for ground freight and $23.92 (with tax) to box it!  The toy in a box I brought in was about 28\"x10\"x4\" and weighed about 8 lbs.  They told me the box the toy came in needed an outer shipping box.  The clerk said that would be $21.95.  I thought total.  Wrong!  That's on top of shipping!  For a cardboard box!  It was declared over sized- thus the premium.  The lesson is to seek out a shipping box before arriving at a UPS store.
0 ||| Let me start off by saying how unique this place is because if the decor inside. It feels like you're walking into an art museum that allows you to drink and party inside.  Free parking and no coverage and drinks are pretty affordable.  This was my escape away from the crowded strip and high class crowd.  I would have given this place a 5 star before because of the trendy social crown and the atmosphere that it brings.\n\nWTF happened to this place?  Every time I come here now, there are a bunch of ghetto ass people with even some sagging their pants down to the knees.  A bunch of annoying punks as well in the parking lot, drunk as hell talking sh*t.  Did someone pass out a flyer of this place in the ghetto and skanky side of vegas?  If i wanted drunk girls that all dressed in tight short, easy access dresses, I would have gone to Tao, XS and all these other nightclubs in the strip, but apparently they come here in the high numbers now also.  I am not feeling the type of people it attracts at all and I'm sure they would feel the same about the trendy and hippy crowd in downtown vegas.  This was my Friday night escape but now I guess i'll replace it with another place.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews about how bad these bartenders are. Real bad service and no system set in place.
3 ||| I like the original chicken sandwich and those awesome waffle fries, but I'm making healthier choices lately. I went with the grilled chicken sandwich. It comes with lettuce, tomato and pickle (I forgot to hold that pickle - I hate it!) and at 260 calories is an excellent alternative to the regular chicken that weighs in at 430. (The Big Mac from the McDonald's next door waddles onto the scale at 540 calories.) Hot, juicy and full of flavor, it's a great sandwich.\n\nChick-Fil-A does not have a \"healthy\" side item. Those yummy waffle fries (which I skipped) are 420 calories and 24 grams of fat. The alternative Carrot and Raisin Salad is 260 calories and 12 grams of fat. It's a good thing these places have to publish nutrition information or I would have thought I was doing well with this option!\n\nI got it with a bottle of water (they don't have any non-caffeine non-calorie options). Paired with the grilled sandwich, a reasonably healthy choice. I later learned, not so healthy. This yummy sandwich had an INSANE 1650 GRAMS OF SODIUM - more than two thirds the recommended daily maximum! D'oh!\n\nWarning! The sandwich drips, as my white shirt learned early on in this encounter. Be prepared.\n\nChick-Fil-A is NOT open on Sundays.
4 ||| I love this place!\n\nI love how clean and organized the store is.  Normally stores like this are a complete mess and I feel like I'm browsing through someone's messy closet.\n\nThe quality of clothing is still great with prices that are more affordable.\n\nThere are a ton of styles to choose from and they constantly get new merchandise in.\n\nLove it!
3 ||| Five stars for the service - our waitress was an expert. We arrived just ahead of the dinner rush but she was great in getting all of the tables around us situated quickly. \nFours stars for the pie - I had the rockaboy and he had the mixed berry crumb. Both were fantastic. \nTwo stars for the food - the fried pickle chips were spicy but good. But my chicken and waffle platter had the smallest and hardest pieces of fried chicken I've ever seen. And my poor guy made the mistake of getting the burrito special. Let's just say he's off Mexican food for a while. Overall, go for the pie and quit while you're ahead.
4 ||| My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.\n\nFiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.\n\nBut then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh.
4 ||| Went here with the mother in law last night for dinner.  Table of 3.  Got there around 6:20.  Immediate seating for a Thursday.  FAR better than when I went to Fleming's in Midvale about 15 minutes prior, who absolutely would not seat us as we didn't have reservations, even though there were 5 waiters standing there doing nothing near the waiter station.... grrr....\n\nAnyways, The Tornado was great.  I had been there once before with the wifey a few years ago and felt it was above average then, but last night the food seemed much better than I remembered.\n\nShrimp Cocktail was standard, nothing special, but MIL likes it so we got it.  \n\nFrench Onion Soup above average.  Good heft to the broth.  The two other salads looked good.\n\nI ordered the Bone in Ribeye, which is my favorite steak due to the marbling.  Medium rare.  Cooked pretty well.  Very good flavor to the steak, perfect crusting and great texture.  A very very very good steak.  Probably a five star steak honestly.\n\nWife and MIL liked their filets as well.  I think the steak prices are 30-48$.\n\nDessert was a chocolate/caramel contraption, which I didn't really partake in but everyone else seemed to love it.  Total price ~ $150 without tip.\n\nVery well done restaurant.  Service was grea
0 ||| Bland food. Bad service. \n\nDisgusting chips and salsa were $3.95. There should be no charge for chips and salsa. If there is a charge, wait staff should not be instructed to upsell it at the table. \n\nChocolate milk was loudly offered as an option to my son. I don't want my son drinking nasty chocolate milk and don't want it loudly offered. \n\nEmpty plates and glasses stacked up and were not removed. \n\nConfusing children's menu referred to a two quesadilla dinner option that came with a serving of chips and a children's drink.  I ordered one with extra cheese and one with chicken. A single plate was served with a huge chicken one and a huge cheese one. A lot of food for such a small plate I thought. \n\nWhen the bill arrived, I was surprised to see a charge for two children's dinners. When I asked to have it removed, I was informed that the children's dinner includes only one quesadilla with \"two flour tortillas.\" I had read the menu wrong. At the time I ordered, there was no request for clarification or indication that I would be billed more than one meal. Since I had ordered two dinners by mistake, I would have expected the dinners to be served on two separate plates, with two sets of accompanying chips with two children's drinks.
0 ||| TERRIBLE!!!!!!\n\nI have been in the state for 4 months and this is the WORST restaurant choice we have made so far. I had a bad feeling and should have listened to my instinct. Wasted $40.\n\nLet me start by saying the host/hostess were the nicest staff at the place. \n\nMy husband ordered the 7 oz sirloin with riblets, seasonal vegatables and mashed potatoes. The sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery. There was no meat to be eaten. It was just a hunk of fat. The riblets even had a weird smoke flavor that he compared to cigarette smoke. We do not go places looking for an all smiles server, but this guy did not smile and when he saw we were not enjoying our meal and my husband's plate was still full, he did not even ask if the food was okay or if there was something he could do. We don't like to complain and just were not in the mood to even let him or the manager know. I really did not expect the food to be so bad. I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip. For the same $40 spent, we could have gotten a meal we actually enjoyed. The only good part was my daughter's chicken fingers, fries and pepsi. Sad. We will not be returning. For such a nice \"looking\" exterior, you would think they'd have more quality food and servers. I guess you get what you pay for..sadly.\n\nDo not go here! We will be voiding it like the plague.
0 ||| Positives- view is great! Friendly staff, just clueless on policies and pleasing the customer.\nCons- very confusing!!! You get a different answer to every question depending on who you ask but then it always comes back to no, we cant do that. Food was bad, nothing I would expect at a steakhouse. Both steaks were overcooked!\n\nWe went there on a Thursday night as a treat to ourselves. Hadn't been there in years. We had our 2 yo with us since it was kids eat free, we thought it would be kid friendly. Saw that hh is only offered in the saloon upstairs so we decided to have a drink and app before going down to eat. The hostess let us know we could sit at any of the low top tables w/o a reserved sign or any hightop table. We chose a low top by the window because of our child. We sat there for awhile wondering if we had to go to the bar ourselves. Finally a lady comes up to us and says she was sorry and nobody wanted to come tell us but the table we were at was actually reserved. I guess if they have a red napkin it means reserved, the hostess was not aware either. So we ask where else we can sit. She says any of the high tops or at the bar. So I ask again to confirm that there is not a single low top table we can sit at with our 2yo?!? So since they can't accommodate us, we ask if we can get hh downstairs, no. They cannot do that, but we can grab our own drinks now and take them down with us, fine. So we get our drinks and take them to the table. Great view!! Skip ahead to ordering. Be prepared to pay extra if you are a meat and potatoes lover. All dinners are served with green beans and a tiny corn on the cob. Both were gross! Table gets a dish of cowboy beans that look and taste like they are just a few beans mixed into tomato sauce. My husband did not eat them and thats saying a lot!! A side of any type of potato is an extra $2-5 and hopefully everyone at the table agrees on one because they are huge sides. He ordered his prime rib med-rare and I order the filet med- well. When they showed up, I would have ate his steak! Both were overcooked. Mine had no pink at all but thats fine to me but his was so tough looking for a prime rib and had a sliver of pink only in the middle. In any other moment he would have sent it back but since at this point it was such a bad experience, all we could do was laugh and so he sucked it up and ate it. To top it off, the waiter tried to sneak one by us and charge us for the child meal. When we pointed it out he says,\" oh oops I gave you the old copy\". Ya ok. We will NOT be going back to Rustlers Rooste!!
4 ||| Best Vet ever!  No nonsense! No trumped up charges. Tells ya like it is. Awesome disposition. Genuine, sincere, considerate, caring personable demeanor.
2 ||| I ordered the usual and customary hamachi sashimi, the dish that sets the bar for me and my sushi adventures.  Well, not the best Hamachi I've had.  It was fresh, but kinda tough, it didn't give me that melt in my mouth kinda feeling I like.  Good portions though.  Kinda expensive.   Fast service.  All in all, just another mediocre experience.  Get your sashimi sushi when you're closer to the ocean.
0 ||| I would seriously avoid this place. I went here based off of reviews. We ordered fried shrimp appetizer. About 10 minutes later the waitress dropped off a plate with shrimp and egg rolls. My husband pointed at the egg rolls and asked what they were, and in the mean time I picked up one of the shrimp and was bringing it to my mouth. The waitress heard him and said \"oh I made a mistake put it down\" so I put the shrimp down and she picked up the plate a dropped it off at the booth next to ours! And acted like nothing was wrong with that! Needless to say the people at the tables across from us saw what happened and were completely disgusted too. If they do that in front of customers I can't imagine what they do in the kitchen. Also there is no air conditioning in this place so they have 2 fans going in the dining area which don't help much. Channel 13 dirty dining or the health district really need to check out this place.
4 ||| Very clean. Very good servers even the restaurant owner came in our table to help us cook the meat.  Excellent customer service. You should try this place.
4 ||| We came here for a short stay 5 years ago and never really left. Palm Creek is our winter home. Facilities and grounds are all top.notch, but the real appeal is the residents who make all of the activities, sports and programs come alive.  Best Pickleball facilities anywhere with a dedicated club that teaches the sport and coordinates social and competitive games for all skill levels, every day of the week.  Hiking, tennis, golf, softball in first class venues. The community welcomes short term stay RVers as well as year round residents. This is NOT your average 55+ park model community!
2 ||| I booked the room over the holiday weekend based upon the pictures posted and the location. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient, but the hotel was clearly not the same as what was posted. The room was clean but had a strong musty odor . The walls must have been paper thin as you could hear neighboring rooms conversations very clearly. This made sleep a challenge. Breakfast was good, with scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon and ham . Free wifi did not work most of the time , and was the slowest that I have ever encountered. Hotel overall has basic accommodations, but should not be confused with a resort which they appear to bill themselves as.
2 ||| Is it just me or shouldn't a cafeteria-style of service include cafeteria-style prices? The food was just ok, the pizza was great, but my daughters thought the bathroom was awesome. I'll return to try the breakfast since I live close by and I've heard good things about it, but I doubt I'll return for dinner. I would rather dine with actual service if I'm paying for a restaurant. It works at the more casual Joes BBQ, but here it doesn't seem to match the ambiance.
1 ||| I have always loved Belk but this store's customer service leaves a lot to be desired! I bought a jean jacket last night and got home to realize they left the security sensor on it.  It was only a few minutes past their closing and I live literally one light away from the store, they said they couldn't help me when I called asking to come back and correct their mistake (I needed the jacket the next day b/c I was flying out of town an hour before the store opened).  I just feel that it was rude not to help me out since their associate made the mistake. The lady on the phone could not have been more rude after I explained, she did not care! Do better Belk
0 ||| Used to love this place. Decided to go there, having never had a bad meal there for a decent price.  Apparently I jinxed it. \n\nOff to a good start with bistro three course meal. Two of us  ordered from it, good selection and reasonable add on's.\n\nTook server a long time to take our order, and she didn't bring bread until after the soup & salads. Really, first time we didnr't get it soon after being seated.\n\nWe have some food allergies. Really stressed to leave them off the plate. She  got it right with the salad. Short term memory apparently since they were still on main entree.\n\nSteak cooked wrong, under temp. Burgundy mushroom sauce the worst I've ever  had. It was more white than burgundy and white onions totally raw. I would never order it again. Main entree a grilled or sauted fish, not breaded, didn't need tartar sauce.\n\nI would go back only to order dishes that have been good in the past. If we were to get this server again, I'd ask to move.\n\nMaybe I watch too much Hell's Kitchen and Masterchef, but these mistakes were cooking 101.
0 ||| You're a coffeehouse.  You charge almost $2.50 for a cup of coffee.  It should not taste like Maxwell House that was brewed seven hours ago.  Period.
3 ||| It's a bar. It's dark, there are dead animals all over the wall and all most all of the food is fried.  I have never been terribly impressed with the food, but its cheap, as is the beer, which is what really matters right?  The service is... adequate.  Most importantly I can ride my bike here, so that's pretty much why I come.
0 ||| I purchased a groupon for a cut and color. I brought my iPad with several hair styles I had that I have loved in the past. I made it very easy for a good stylist however  the cut was uneven and the color was really very, very dark it was very bad!! I not only paid for the groupon and had to pay an additional 30.00 for what he called highlights! I ended up going to Supercuts and they were able to straighten out the cut and redid the highlights! It looks great now. I am very upset that I wasted money on  Crimpers!! Bad place and the owner Frank was the guy who did my hair. Don't waste your money!!   I will be calling for a refund!
4 ||| \"Welcome to Big Dogs; where you can eat, drink, smoke and play.\"\n\nWell, not any more.\n\nJust got the word.  Wiesner Jr is closing the place to focus on brewing beer at the North Rancho location.  I have eaten Walleye at the Sahara location every Friday for 5 years.  I'm going to miss it.  \n\nThe beer was my least favorite part of going to Big Dogs.  The Dirty Dog IPA gives me a hangover that I do not get from any other alcohol, except their Jackpot 777!  When reinheitsgebot (Bavarian purity law) gets thrown to the curb you should expect bad things.\n\nIts been real, its been fun, but it hasn't been real fun.
4 ||| My Girlfriend and I just recently purchased a home in North Glendale and when the house was inspected, it was noted that we needed a rain cap and the flashing repaired on the chimney. AZ Chimney Sweep came highly recommended and their service was AWESOME. Was able to get an appointment for the work quickly and easily. The scope of work was went over in a professional matter and the work was completely to our expectations. Looking forward to working with Justin and the team again in the future! Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone in AZ!
4 ||| First pho place I went to outside California, who knew Vegas has a decent pho place! I liked the atmosphere and the environment. Service was fast and friendly and the bowl of pho was pretty damn good. I had my share in pho and this is one of the top, maybe top 15. The broth was not too sweet or too sour; it had the right consistency to it. They gave us a lot of noodles but that's not a bad thing made me full pretty fast. The meat is good, very little though compared to some places.\n\nWill come back here whenever I go back to Vegas.
2 ||| My boyfriend and I visited on a Saturday afternoon. We tried mussels, clam chowder, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a burger.  The mussels were an appetizer portion and were enough for three people. They were perfectly cooked and very sweet.  The shrimp are sold a la carte. I ordered 6 of them, and was a bit let down that 2 of them were a bit dry. The cocktail sauce served with the shrimp had wonderfully spicy horseradish and was perfect.  The New England clam chowder was not overly thick and had lots of clams in it. Lastly, the burger, topped with gorgonzola cheese came with fries and cole slaw and was excellent.  The only reason I give this review 3 stars is because our waiter got overwhelmed by a few large parties and disappeared on us.  We had to flag down the hostess to get our waiter to bring us our check. Other than some dry shrimp, and the service issue, we had an enjoyable dinner.
2 ||| Huge lines to check out, which would be one thing if they had all hands on deck. But not when you have girls standing behind the register not ringing people up.  \n\nI came in for one thing and one thing only. Batiste Dry Shampoo. \n\nI found it on and end cap with a sign that said $2 off, regular $7.99. YAY, it's my lucky day right? Well I thought so until waiting forever in line and it not ringing up the correct price, I told the girl it was supposed to be $5.99, I got a response of \"are you sure\". She told her manager that it wasn't ringing up correctly, so her manager sent her to grab the sign. As she headed in the wrong direction my boyfriend went to show her the sign which said exactly what I said, All Batiste Dry Shampoo $2 off. In the mean time she found another sign that showed where the bottle I have (for brunettes) wasn't regularly $7.99. But, since the bottles are not priced and there was no specific price on the end cap, I don't see how that is fair. If you are going to exclude certain items, it needs to be made clear on all signage in all areas the product is located. \n\nThe manager told the girl to give me the $2 off and this is where it went from a 2 star to a 3-4 star experience. The manager explained to the girl how to override the price in the most helpful, kind voice I have heard from a retail manager in quite some time. She was extremely patient and helpful. Kudos to the manager working Feb 1st in the evening.
4 ||| Memorial Day. \n\n90+ degrees. \n\nTwo friends and I had just had a delicious lunch at San Tan Brewery and were on the hunt for a decadent finish. We stopped at a bakery, and all they had were cookies. We spotted Kokopelli, looked at their menu outside, and decided to splurge on a brownie dessert and a dessert drink.\n\nWe went in and the place was cute and totally empty. \n\nOur waiter was a sweetheart and sold us on the same items we were salivating for. A few minutes later, he came out and said they were out of ice cream. Bye bye, brownie. Bye bye, drink.\n\nWe decided to split a few glasses of champagne, the Royale and the Imperial. Both were sweet, but refreshing. \n\nI really wanted that brownie...
3 ||| Came here to figure out where I stood in the Mediterranean Grill v. Aladdin's debate.  Conclusion?  I'm still sitting on the fence, but I'm okay with that.  I like them both.\n\nI ordered the falafel pita wrap here, which I've also eaten at Aladdin's.  The falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good--crunchy on outside, but not dry on the inside.  I'd say it's crunchier here than at Aladdin's.  Two things I prefer about Aladdin's falafel wrap are: the toasted pita and it seemed better wrapped (the Mediterranean Grill one fell apart sooner in my hands).  But, still, all in all, the falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good.  The wrap comes with the usual lettuce, tomato and tahini--nothing out of the ordinary, like the pickled vegetables that Aladdin's adds (which I very much like), but I was plenty satisfied.\n\nThe food and beverage selection is smaller than Aladdin's, but it's a smaller establishment, so I wouldn't hold it against them.  (In response to an earlier review: they don't have a hot mint tea, but their iced tea is mint).  The ambiance is weird here, but there's also something cool about trundling down those stairs to the basement and feeling like you know about a hidden gem.
0 ||| Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.   \n\nI absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.\n\nWe waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  \n\nWhen the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)\n \nAfter the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. \n\nThe pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.\n\nNo surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).\n\nFINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.\n\nI wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.\n\nOh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.   \n\nFirst and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.   There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business.
0 ||| Nothing but issues and my door isn't even installed yet! I ordered my garage door at Home Depot and this is the company they contract with. Everything started out ok...they came out 2 days after I placed the order to measure and check out the site. We are converting our carport to a garage and the door ordered was a 10wx7h. I was told that the door would be in the week of Thanksgiving. Stapley finally called me last week to say the door would be in on Dec 11. So we scheduled Dec 13 for the installation. On Dec 12 at 2:30 in the afternoon I get a call saying they ordered a 10x6'9\" door instead of the 10x7 and they would need to install a new header. I didn't know that garage door installers are also framers...hmmmm.  Since this was their mistake I requested they install my opener for free. I was told they could do one or the other not both. So it was my choice...have them install a new header to correct their mistake in ordering a door that was 3\" shorter WITHOUT telling me in advance or install my garage door opener. I should mention if I choose the opener they would need to schedule a time to come back they cant do it all in one day!! Are you kidding me???  I chose to have them install the opener, and they said they would be here to install the door this morning 12/13/13 at 8am. When I called them at 9:10 no one answered, so I left a message. I called them back at 9:30 and was told the installer would be here in about 30 minutes someone added another job on his schedule..but not the scheduler.  I will never recommend this company to anyone. They completely dropped the ball on this and are not very willing to make things right. They should correct what they screwed up and install the opener.....poor customer service.\n\n\nI waited to update my review hoping things would change....my opinion of this company has not changed at all.  I should say that the very professional installer finally showed up at 10:40 and left at 1:00. That is a lot of work for 1 guy. You would think they would have 2 guys on each door and then they would be closer to on time!\n\nIt is now 12/28 and my garage door opener is still not installed. No return calls no contact from them at all. I suppose I need to either go down there or call from a different number so they will answer. I know they have caller ID and that is probably why they never answer when I call.\n\nWish I could do 0 stars.
0 ||| When you head to the rollercoaster at an amusement park, you know for every dip down you go, there will be an offsetting climb back out of that valley.  Unfortunately, for this restaurant, as far as food and service are concerned, you are heading down into the abyss - and then you pursue every possible lower level of the abyss you  never imagined.\n\nAlright. you are going to tell me they were busy b/c of the Christmas parade - but, seriously folks, this is not their first rodeo.  They had more than enough wait staff to handle the size of their dining room. So why the panic? Why the inability to get waited on?\n\nWe were seated instantly by the thoroughly delightful hostess who welcomed us graciously.  At this point, we were at the top of the roller coaster with nowhere to go but down, down, down........  Then we waited 17 minutes - 17 minutes - till we could even get a glass of water. We should have walked. Really. We should have just walked.  But we hadn't read the Yelp reviews so we thought - the food sounded interesting.  We can wait it out.\n\nYou know that old saying - no good deed goes unpunished?\n\nBefore ordering, I notice that the menu has entrees with either mashed potatoes or the potato of the day.  When I inquired to the waitree \"what is the potato of the day\", she replied \"mashed potatoes\".  So much for the potato of the day.....\n\nWere there specials of the day? Anything special with the wines? Have no idea. It was never mentioned to us. So I guess there weren't any.  So we order - my DSD orders a spinach and pasta dish, my hubs orders the Merlot pot roast and adds a side salad, and I ordered a salad with chicken added.\n\nGiven the wait, I asked the waitress for the access code for the WiFi, figuring if it took 17 minutes to get a glass of water, there was not much hope for getting our food (what a premonition that was.....but I get ahead of myself here).  And what does she say? \"It changes every hour and I have no idea, I will see if I can find the manager and get it\"......yeah, I am still waiting.....\n\nAfter we wait another 15 minutes, DH's salad finally arrives. It was not a bad side salad - baby greens, bacon, tomato, and cement blocks.  Oh, wait, those were croutons? It was hard to tell.  I love croutons. I even make my own.  But, as my hubs said - and he NEVER complains - they were so hard and crunchy, he could not hear any of our conversation while he tackled them......\n\nNow dinner arrives before he even has time to finish the salad.  DSD's pasta is a nice sized portion and she said the garlic EVOO sauce was light and tasty and didn't mask the spinach or tomatoes or basil.    DH's pot roast was a sizable portion and was served with mashed potatoes (as opposed to the potato of the day) and a side of veggies (squash, carrots, onions).  He said that the potatoes were rather dry but the gravy on the meat was good - although it might have been nice to have some salt and pepper to go with it (we actually had to ask, as that is not standard on the tables - really??).  My salad was, to say the least, pitiful.  I asked for chicken to be added to the salad - which the server forgot. The salad was presented nicely - but, to be honest, $10 for a cup of baby greens with a few bits of goat cheese and perhaps two tablespoons of pecans and a few roasted grapes? I would have been better off with two side salads.  I asked the server to be sure not to charge me for the chicken since it was not delivered - at which point, she said \"did you ask for it\"?\n\nWait, we aren't done.  Having grown up in the business, you learn early on not to reach in front of customers to fill water glasses, etc.  Obviously, server slept thru that lesson.  As she reaches across DSD's pasta to refill my hubs water glass......she dribbles ice water into my DSC's pasta and then doesn't even notice, just spins on her heels and beats a path back somewhere......\n\nOh wait - there's more......before I leave, I decide to run to the restrooms where there is a line because the women's room only has two stalls and, of course, one is out of order....while I am waiting patiently, a server comes in to wash her hands and remarks to me something like \"as a server, I like to have clean hands\" which I thought - how I wish we might have had her rather that the poor excuse of a server that we had.....and then it happens.  Most servers would not have opened the door with their bare hands to leave, realizign that is where most of the germs are - but that was nothing compared to the fact that the server took her perfectly clean hands AND BLEW HER NOSE INTO A PAPER TOWEL. OMG. I was completely appalled. Whatever good she thought she did washing those hands was undone by the nose-blowing.\n\nThis is prime location. I am sure that the wine is what attracts customers.  The service was awful - all I kept thinking is that this place is a candidate for Mystery Diners.....
4 ||| This is the Real Deal. Classic American Chinese food served fresh and hot with excellent service. I can't believe that I had never eaten here until I got a Groupon. I even suffered severe\" Groupon Guilt\" when the meal was over and the check came. To be completely honest I could not bring myself to use it on my first visit. The food had been too wonderful. The wait staff was too good.  I ordered 3 entrees that day...figuring I would take home the leftovers. I had scallion chicken made with dark meat chicken (your choice)  , fresh vegetables with tofu ( medium spicy) and chicken and broccoli . All were outstanding.. \nThe atmosphere is hard to find anymore. Three large aquariums dominate the two levels of dining area. I chose a booth in the bar area that is right next to one of the tanks.It is soo relaxing to just watch the fish swim. You understand why Drs offices always had aquariums back in the 1900s.\n\nIf you are looking for a Chinese food \"fix\" this is the place. I am tired of the little dingy take-out joints that are  in every strip mall. This place is an escape to a more sophisticated era of Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. I also tried the lunch buffet and it was excellent. Enjoy.
4 ||| Always fresh sushi! Staff is friendly! Very reasonably priced! This place is awesome.
3 ||| I had plans to eat breakfast at Palace Station, but right as a friend and I turned from the 15 onto West Sahara, we both realized that it's one of the older casinos and we'll walk out smelling like smoke.  So, we kept driving.  Barely a half mile further and hidden in a corner of an older business park is this restaurant.  Why not give it a try?\n\nYou walk in and it looks like an old pub where you'd go to order a beer instead of a meal.  When we sat down, we were given a menu with a large list of both breakfast and lunch items, the two meals they specialize in.\n\nWe both ended up ordering the breakfast croissant, both with sausage instead of bacon and I got pub potatoes while my friend got the potato cakes.  The food is amazing.  Our waitress was friendly and the prices worked.\n\nIt's so nice to find a breakfast place that breaks away from the typical crowds and foods and surprises their customers.  This place has been around since 1984 and I had never even heard of it.  I will definitely go back and look forward to seeing what they can offer for lunch.
1 ||| This place had generally good reviews, but I had an entirely different experience. It was a very disappointing.\n\nA friend and I had decided to go because we wanted to try their dim sum. I had heard from friends that it was great. We walked in about 12:15 and did not leave until about 2:30. In my opinion, that is way too long for an hour lunch break.\n\nWe walked in and it was very hectic. The waitresses were yelling and the tables were still dirty from the customers who had left. We went up to the counter to order, but she told us to sit down with our menu. We saw a bunch of people walk in and order at the counter so we filled in our sheet and brought it up. At this point it was about 12:30 before she even took our sheet because the waitress were taking care of the customers who had just walked in. \n\nSo we sat there and waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes had gone by and nothing. 40 minutes. Nothing. We were very upset because we only had a short lunch break. About 43 minutes later, our first dish came out. Slowly, our little dim sum dishes came out. One by One. Our dishes were being thrown on the table without care and the waitress just left without telling us what it was. We went up to get some hot tea as well and both containers were completely empty. We to complain and the manager said that this was a new girl and she didn't really have a handle on things yet. Our last dish came about 45 minutes later from our first dish. \n\nA few of the dim sum dishes were really tasty, but it did not make up for lack of management and service skill. I do not think that I'll ever be returning.
4 ||| The 5-star reviews are true!\n\nI took my car in to have my passenger side door panel repaired. I swiped a concrete column and made a huge dent on the side. New skin and new paint was needed. The owner, Steve, showed me the new door skin the day I dropped it off to assure the correct one was going to be installed. It took three full business days to repair, just as promised. When the work was complete, I looked at the car from every conceivable angle and found ZERO imperfections! \n\nChoose Ultra Collision. Fair price for perfect work. Ask for Steve. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
3 ||| Cute and sweet Korean family running this place but really thought the donuts tasted like Safeway or regular grocery store donuts (got the chocolate long John and cruller). But I don't have an alternative go-to donut place so I guess this is my only option and it's not bad. Would rather support them than buy a donut at Safeway!
4 ||| Symonn has been grooming our family's dogs for almost 10 years now.  We followed her from a previous location and she always does an exceptional job.  My Havanese is treated well, her ears and tail are perfectly fluffy, and she is done with a couple of hours.  I would highly recommend her!  Also should note: her specialty is difficult dogs.
0 ||| Overpriced and microwaved.  Eat more than 10 feet away from the game and enjoy a meal.
3 ||| Don't be turned off by the so-so reviews. Yes, Taylor's isn't going to be setting any trends for culinary adventure, but they serve up good fried fish & shellfish at a reasonable price.  The chowder and the raw clams & oysters are decent as well.\n\nThe decor is 80's kitschy, New England seafood restaurant and the staff is very nice. Small bar with beer, wine and liquor (yet they always seem out of Sam Adams) \n\nIf you come here for one thing, and one thing only, it's the Ipswich Fried Clams.  It's nearly impossible to find this in the Phoenix area, and if you do, it's usually overpriced and not prepared very authentically. The Fried Clams here are fantastic, a good sized portion and cooked perfectly, just as you'd get at a clam shack in Maine!
0 ||| By far the worst strip club I ever went to. Came on a Thursday night, and I was immediately surrounded by ugly, PUSHY strippers. One of them was so desperate she threatened me when I was trying to talk my friend. Plus, I wanted to get a lap dance and the stripper kept getting shots on my bill and then got one for the drink girl. Then she hiked up the price of the dance because we were in a special area even tho I specifically said I didn't want it. Can't say enough bad things about this place.
0 ||| Ajo Als on 16th Street es no bueno, my girlfriend and her brother got food poisoning from here yesterday! that's just gross!
0 ||| Went here once for lunch at the suggestion of a friend from work.  he is no longer my friend.  I've got nothing, it was awful, just awful.  I love the fact that you also get hosed a nice \"fee\" for using your debit card for any purchase.  Great way to keep them coming back, nickel and dime the piss out of your customers.  The drink refill policy there is a joke.  \n\nI'd like to give them an \"A\" for effort, but they lost me with the craptastic debit card fee and communist-style drink refill pricing, they will receive an overwhelming \"F\" rating from me.  Change that and I might give ya another shot there, Stalin.
0 ||| I lived at the Heritage for close to three years so I have a pretty good understanding of this property. First, the apartments are not well insulated AT ALL!! ALL my windows leaked air - the blinds were hanging on by a thread & would fall off the window on top of me on a regular basis. You put in a maintenance request & they come & rig them only to fall off again a week later! Management is horrible. They all have nice fake smiles but when it really comes down to it they could care less about their tenants!! Break-ins are becoming a regular occurrence there too so if safety is a concern, I wouldn't chose these apartments. Also they are very overpriced & will raise your rent EVERY time you sign for another year by at least $50 a month.\nTo top it all off I just moved out & gave them my forwarding address & they sent my deposit to the apartment at their community that I have just moved out of. Talk about incompetent!!\n\nOh ya -- also the landscaping people come at least 1x a week & they keep up the grounds -- but you can't leave your windows open as they wear motorized backpacks that are extremely loud & leave your apartment filled w the smell of gas!!\n\nRead more: http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/AZ-Phoenix-The-Heritage-867679.html#ixzz0X3kkAfRC
3 ||| Not the best Hooters I've been to, but the wings were great as usual! The staff wasn't the friendliest, but I was not let down by the mozzarella sticks!
4 ||| Absolutely fabulous. Our waiter, Adam, was great. The food was great. I'd go back here in a heartbeat.\nThe heirloom tomato salad may be the best thing i've ever eaten.
0 ||| New to Charlotte with a cat needing her annual exam/vaccines, I did some researching online for veterinarians, and even though I couldn't find a website for Long Animal Hospital, it seemed like it was highly reviewed and had very convenient hours. I didn't really have any issues at first but...\n\nAfter one annual exam, I was told that my cat needed to have her teeth cleaned and at least one tooth (maybe two) removed. The morning of the surgery I was told to bring her in first thing at 7AM and they would start operating on her shortly after. I asked them to please trim her nails while she was going to be under anesthesia. \n\nWhat went wrong? 1) I didn't receive a call until after noon updating me that the surgery was beginning. It appears as though I brought her in early for no reason at all to wait for 5 hours scared. 2) She was so scared that when they tried to put her down with normal anesthesia it didn't work so they had to go to their more extreme option for anesthesia, which meant more money I had to pay. The final bill was over 30% more than what they had estimated for me. 3) They removed 3 teeth instead of what they originally thought, which meant I had to pay more per extraction. 4) They had a breakdown in communication and her nails were never trimmed. 5) Upon checking out they recommended that I buy dental treats to keep her up with her oral maintenance. I asked what key ingredient to look for in dental products and the lady at the counter pointed out \"tocopherols\" aka a preservative I found out when I got home. After not one but many fails, I refuse to go back to Long Animal Hospital. I would seriously consider going to another veterinarian if I were you.
2 ||| This place had some amazing soup! I had Spicy Beef Soup for lunch and boy o' boy was it delicious. The lunch came with rice and some asian sides (including kimchi) it was all delish! I would definitely recommend their soup here. I gave only 3 stars because customer service was so-so... They didnt talk at all except \"what your order?\". They didnt refill our drinks. And i had to ask for napkins. Other than that, food is amazing!
2 ||| Ok, the supermarket is not terrible, but they don't have a fresh bakery. Their donut section is bigger than their bagel section, and the produce is not very fresh, especially the berries which have gone bad on me after a day. Compared to you local Fry's or Safeway in Scottsdale and there is no competition. But it's close and clean so they'd get three stars from me.
3 ||| Well, by far better than S and K Menswear which is now out of business and for good reason.\nI bought a suit hear and received some good service.   Tailor was on hand and did a good job sizing me and getting the job done in a timely manner.   \nI got a feeling after my purchase that they didn't want to spend much more time with me.   Sort of like, thanks for your purchase now don't waste any more of my time.\nI plan to try another men's store for my next purchase but I may go back here sometime too.  I just needed them to be more engaged in my life and clothing needs for me to make them \"my clothier\".
3 ||| Relatively small airport with a regional feel. Kind of limited on food options but not too bad. Taxi line can be brutal in the summer heat so keep that in mind...
4 ||| Margaritas were fantastic. Jalape\u00f1o cream soup to die for. Service was good and fast. Portions are enough to take home s doggie bag
4 ||| Cinemark Movies 10 made my date night SO much cheaper than I was planning. Me and my date wanted to see Tron Legacy (a few months late, I know) after dinner and for the both of us on a Friday cost $4.50! I was pretty impressed. Usually dollar-ish theaters tend to be pretty run down but the interior barely was and the screen had one slight flaw but that was it.\n\nWord is though that at times this theater can be a little on the sketchy side. Personally I have yet to witness this but theres always next time.
4 ||| Great little feel-good joint. Lots of locals who appeared to know each other well, but not to the point of being exclusionary to strangers. Good prices and good selection. Even had a food special (looked good) but didn't try as we had eaten elsewhere prior-to. If I lived in Mesa, I'd probably be here at least once a week.
4 ||| It doesn't get any better!  Moda Fina not only has the finest jewlery, but it also has the latest styles and on trend looks.  Everything from classic to trendy, Moda Fina has it!  The service is the best and this upscale store makes your whole shopping experience ah-mazing!  Whoever says \"Money can't buy happiness\"...hasn't shopped at Moda Fina! lol!
4 ||| Took the family here for breakfast. The exterior was unassuming and did not prepare us for how delicious the food inside would be. The croissants and pastries were particularly delicious and complemented the meal really well. Everything was fresh and the service by the owner was very attentive and welcoming (not the French stereotype). The only downside was it took a bit longer to get an extra cup of coffee as he had to brew a new batch. The upside was even the coffee was good.\n\nThe entire family enjoyed their breakfast and we would return without hesitation.
0 ||| My girlfriend was physically there to order food for carry out. Food was given to her got back to her place to find out the order was wrong. Called to tell them the order was wrong which they agreed they were wrong. They wouldnt deliver the order we had to go to get it...Fine, whatever. I went to get the correct order to which when I got there they told me I needed to bring back the old food. To which I highly disagreed. There was no reason they couldn't just give me the food. It was their mistake to begin with, she was physically there and the only one there, and they gave us the wrong food. Yet still I had to bring back the incorrect order. I sat and argued with them for 5 minutes about how it was their mistake, we had been there twice and still didn't have the problem resolved. Came, picked up the food and went back for a refund. There is no reason it should have resorted to that. They can't sell the food, can't bring it back to the kitchen for sanitary reasons(unless super shady and to which a health inspector would shut them down). Didn't even taste the food but don't need to after the way I and my girlfriend were treated
0 ||| I have used Hertz for business and family travel for the past 10 years. I must say that over the last few years, their service has really slipped.  We have rented in multiple states from Oakland, SFO, Maui, Cleveland, etc.  this review is for the Hertz in the Phoenix airport, AND this was the second time we used Hertz at this airport in 2-4 weeks, as my husband told me \"never again\".  We booked on Hotwire, a great way to save money, but again, arriving at 9:00 pm at the Hertz counter, only two people and 30 people in line, the same thing as last time!  Again, they have 7 kiosks, ALL not working again, geez, again, the same nonfunctional kiosks from last time (don't they ever fix those things), totally frustrated and in reading past reviews for this Hertz, for the last few years these kiosks are never working!  As we are waiting in line, angry customers are looming and waiting in the Hertz lobby, I asked what's wrong, and apparently Hertz was \"out of cars\" and was having customers wait as they scrambled to find them cars. Another angry customer in front of us was on the phone to Complain, apparently he got so frustrated, he vowed never to come back.  So after waiting 30 minutes, please dear god have a car for us and let us out of this place, we were given the 15 minute up a sell speech by the Hertz counter help, she recommended a bigger car for a price, \"no, please give me my car\", take additional insurance for $30/day, \"no, please give me my car\", do you want us to refill gas for you, \"no, please give me my car\", do you need gps, \"no, please give me my car\", do you need.....\"no, please give me my car\" I think they do this to tired travelers so they submit to higher prices out of sheer aggrivation, but NO, we didn't budge and got our car....yea!  Now le me the heck out of this Hertz h..ll
1 ||| What a mess!!! Looking for outdoor fabric and this place is close to home, so it was our first stop. No outdoor fabric could be found, but in fairness, I am not the type of person that likes to \"hunt\" for things. I'm more of a get in get out kinda girl, and this store is most definitely NOT conducive to that way of shopping.\n\nAfter a quick circle around the shop, we went and asked where the outdoor fabric is. Answer: \"if we have it, I would think it's near the upholstery\". If? Think? We circled again but there is zero organization in the place, and I was shopping with someone that doesn't have patience for that, so we quickly left. \n\nAlso, crowded and dirty. If they had organization, training, and a mop, they would get more business. They could even raise prices. But, I'm sure there are people that would rather dig and shop in a less fancy place to save the money, and if that's you, this is a good place. Never thought I would feel like a fabric store snob, but I guess that's me.
1 ||| I don't know why I even bother trying to write a review after Nicole has already been to a place. She's got it perfectly summarized - this place is full of the kinds of totally useless stuff that you absolutely love to have for any party. Gift wrap, balloons, candy, cards and all sorts of perfectly pretty and colorful crap that you really don't need except when you're having a party.\n\nIn the back is a very large costume section with all the accessories you need if you want to buy an outfit. That said, you might be able to save a bunch of money by renting the stuff instead from a proper costume store.\n\nPrice are hit or miss. I did spot some 99 cent rolls of wrapping paper as well as some six dollar rolls right next to them. Honestly, it was tough for me to tell the difference.
1 ||| I don't like writing negative reviews but honestly after my visit to Andys I have no idea what the 4 & 5 star ratings are all about...\n\nFirst the good ~ my pedicure was good.  The lady actually listened to what I told her I wanted unlike the 2 nail techs that worked on me later.  The massage was nice and the color and design came out great.  The only downside to the pedicure was the \"upselling\" of services but most places do that so I don't consider that much of a negative.\n\nMy acrylics tho was a totally different story.  I told the tech I wanted french tips ~ what I ended up with were tips that were painted white which began chipping off in a matter of days.  Part of it was my fault as I was talking to my friend and not paying attention to what was being done.  Once I did notice I just didn't have the time for them to start over.   Even with an appointment I had to wait 30 minutes after before anyone could work on me.  The 2 techs that worked on my nails started having a rapid fire conversation in Vietnamese and took their time getting back to my nails.\n\nThe nails were way to thick ~ my term for the end result was hooker nails... ughhh!   Even tho the pedicure came out well at a good price I will not go back again.  I found a salon much closer with a very skilled nail tech who I will be going to from now on.  It costs more but then again you get what you pay for.
1 ||| Kinda greasy, service was prompt but hard to hear (he was a mumbler).  Food wasn't the worst I've had but Habana, Cuba in San Jose, CA set the bar really high and this place didn't come close.  I suppose you could do worse for a hotel restaurant.
3 ||| Mert's is a great find in downtown Charlotte.  The service is solid and the food is pretty good.  They have a beer and wine menu, but seem surprised when you order and adult beverage.\n\nI took my servers suggestion and ordered beef ribs and fried fish.  It arrived along with sides of macaroni and cheese and black eyed peas.  The black eyes were some of the best I have ever had.  The beef ribs were really short ribs and were gristly and disappointing.\n\nMy husband opted for the special \"Tia's Chicken\" - chicken breaded with Parmesan and Italian seasoning topped with cream sauce.  This along with green beans and sweet potatoes made for a solid meal.  The chicken was good and a huge portion.\n\nIf back in Charlotte, we would definitely visit again.
1 ||| The atmosphere was amazing. The sushi was fresh but lacked pizzaz and taste. My order was incorrect and the waitress was busy so i ended up just shutting my mouth. The bathroom was disgusting. The price was decent .. happy hour prices. I wont be back. Major dissapointment.
3 ||| I don't go to this location very often...so I can't really comment on the service etc. But I do use these guys a lot for catering for my work. Nico the owner is always extremely helpful in this regard. Him and the staff always help get the order in and make sure everything is on time. I would highly recommend for your catering needs.  They also have a new location on 215/rainbow opening up soon. As far as the food goes...I love their rotisserie chicken, salad mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. I have never gotten any complaints when I use these guys. Give em a try.
2 ||| I am a fan. But I would like to be more of a fan, and so I am here harping on the two problems I have with CC. One is the parking mentioned by other reviewers and the other is the bad service at the food court. I don't mean the samples handed out on almost every aisle and the hassle of the lines as stereotypical fat people line up like hippos at a rotten carcass to 'just try a sample'. I mean the little restaurant inside the store where the hippos line up to drown their peptides in sugar and grease. The food at any CC is outstanding fast food at an unbelievably good price. The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean. Brave the parking and the neutral service because when you need a good hotdog/pizza/frozen yogurt, it's a great spot.
0 ||| Purchased a Groupon for an exam, cleaning and X-ray. Called to schedule and they only had something available about 6 weeks out. So I said Yes and I scheduled the appointment and took the time off work. I show up on the scheduled day after driving 15 miles to get there and they have no appointment for me and tell me they're sorry but I'll have to reschedule. Complete waste of my time and money. Staff had no remorse and acted like it was my fault. Very rude.
4 ||| Amazing experience! Jose went above and beyond any expectations I had prior to waking in. He was able to answer all questions and give advice on stuff I didn't even know I needed to know. He was able to provide samples at little or no cost to make sure I got what I needed. Highly recommended and will definitely be back!
3 ||| These 4 stars actually belong to Mary, the manager.  While I ended up not buying my road bike from this store due to the deep discount I received from another LBS for the same brand road bike at an upgrade level, I wanted to share with you that Mary is awesome, patient, and very helpful.  I would recommend her to novice women bikers. \n \n I'm very particular about purchasing merchandise from women, as I am a huge proponent of supporting women's business enterprise and supporting women in general. \n\nMary spent a bunch of time figuring out the right bike size for me, and searched the computer to find out the availability and prices for 2012 models. She made me feel very comfortable and educated me on bikes and riding.  She rocks.
4 ||| Pittsburgh doesn't really have its choice of indoor climbing walls, but I was pretty impressed by this location (though note, this review is just for bouldering). The bouldering area is huge, and on a Saturday afternoon surprisingly empty with no need to wait for any route. It's labeled from V0 upwards... although the floor is padded, the walls do go up pretty high (the 10ft estimate from before is accurate), so a fall would be pretty scary... they do give you an option to wear a helmet, but I saw nobody doing so.\n\nThe routes are all clearly marked, and difficulty seemed to correspond with rating - there are also a ton to choose from, so you won't get bored. One staff member in particular was amazing - Allen - who spent the time giving climbing tips and encouragement to whomever needed it. Costs are also reasonable ($12/day, + $3/shoes, $2/chalk), and it's located in a nice strip mall with the East End Co-Op nearby for food. Overall, not a bad place to spend an afternoon!
0 ||| Local Pizza restaurant in Matthews, I sent my niece, daughter and little niece to eat and the staff was very rude! They had two servers and they seem discombobulated will never recommend this pizzeria to anyone in the neighborhood better off going to Jets Pizza!!!!
0 ||| My husband bought my bike from BikeSource, they did not put my bike together properly.  After riding it my chain guard rattled where it wasn't assembled correctly.  They also told me I owed them money for some accessories, turned out they owed my husband a few bucks, they could have kept the money if they wouldn't have hounded me, about me owing them money.  And lastly, the best thing about buying from a store like this is the convenience of a warranty and the service policy , well you know they think I am an asshole, so I don't really want to go in there.  I love my bike, I wish we would have purchased it from REI.
2 ||| Based on special WIne Tasting event @ Bar.  {Otherwise i could NEVER see how i could/would dine here - case in point: initially seated in dinning room. Took quite a while to have our (very snotty & uppity) server apporach us.  We inidicated we were doing their special event, and OMG did he ever show he did NOT want any part of THAT with US}\n\nWe (ThankFully) asked to be moved to lounge area which only had 2 other tables being served.  (I just KNEW we would have had a more than terrible  time with Mr. Crabby Pants had we stayed in his section).\n\nWe were promptly moved, seated & served in very quick succession.  Turned out BEST decsion.  We were given professional & informative tastings of wines from Napa & South Africa.  \n\nAlthough this was a fun, different and good little event, and we really enjoyed it, it was NO where near as great an experience that we had at the CG in North Scottsdale 2 weeks earlier, ie: NITE and DAY difference.  (pours were half the size, and they were extremely hesitant, if at all, to give another taste of 1 which u may have liked....\n\nI WOULD go back to N. Scottsdale for a Wine & Dine but i would never suggest getting a \"10\" on the Snob-O-Factor here.
3 ||| They aren't great, but they certainly are exceptional. It's just around the corner from where I live so from time to time, usually during football season for mnf, is what I love coming here for if it's just me to lay low and watch the game minus the company you find in a typical sports bar crowd. The food is exceptional and reasonably priced. I'm mostly a beer guy, but here I actually will spring for some wine once in a while. I'm also normally a pizza guy. I mean I really, really like pizza, but here I've gotten pretty much everything else but that, simply because I already know the pizza is good, but so are the other pastas or sandwiches they have, which are slightly cheaper. My favorite so far is their roast beef sandwich. I've always found the waiters to be good and accommodating and I even like the patrons that will come in, which are either families in the dining area or people just sitting at the bar drinking a glass of wine while they wait for their take out order. Never found it to be too crowded, or too loud, or otherwise obnoxious. All of which is why I really like the place. Usually during the course of a game I'll order a pasta or sandwich and a couple beers and the bill will be less than $20 so that's pretty good.
0 ||| This place hands down is the worst. The food is Mediocre it's not even worth the wait. We came in at 12:30 and didn't get seated until 1:15. And we waited another 20 mins for our order to be taken. We came in with a large group and even after waiting an hour we didn't get to sit together cause I guess It's too difficult to push tables together. And they were so pushy about separating us from each other. Everyone who works here looks so miserable while they're working like they hate their life. The service here is so rude that it just ruins the meal for you. Also the tables who were sat after us received their food and water way after us. Pho Kim Long is so dysfunctional, unorganized, and has one of the work customer service I have ever received. I'm sure there are other pho places in Vegas that are way better than this.
0 ||| This has to be one of the worst restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is just pitiful.  The service is OK as befitting a small neighborhood restaurant.  We had egg rolls that were so dripping in oil that it was leaking out as you picked them up.  Bright yellow oily drippings. Not cool.  The kung pow was so-so as was the garlic chicken.  The best part of the meal was the almond cookie!  Even the fortune cookie was sub par. I will not be returning!
0 ||| I went in to get a shampoo, wow NO help at all!! They didnt even ask me if I needed help or even greeted me. The two employees were just gossiping in the back room. Got out of there and never coming back!
0 ||| What the f@$\u00a3\u20ac I went to get some of the pretzel hamburgers they are advertising and after making us wait for their service we got told the don't have pretzel buns....if your advertising something and promoting it it's supposed for u to have them available....lame store
3 ||| Four stars - not because the facility itself is stellar, it certainly needs updates and could use more space - but the staff was so friendly and helpful! The atmosphere was inviting and communal, really nice to see a Y that is still a full mission where men can stay and get on their feet. And art classes! And dodgeball! And I had a great workout in the gym.
2 ||| I give it a 3 because the cages or whatever you call them are pretty small. There isnt much to see. This place definatly needs a make over. However I do always have a good time, the staff seems to really enjoy what they do. \nThey just need more shows and new animals, or exibits where you can see the animals. \nMaybe touch up the aquarium section. \n\nI do give 5 stars to the shark and sting ray petting area but it is really dumb you have to pay more to get in there. Luckily I knew the admission person who let me in but I remember it being a ridiculous price.
4 ||| Really? What is up with this place? Can I ever walk out of here without being stuffed and not having finished my meal???? \n\nI tried to be smart this time ordering a half sandwich-still too much. Thank goodness I take my doggie bags home to my little 4-legger who enjoys good meat:) The pickles are the best thing going. I just love them and can't go there without eating the entire dish of them. I was there mid morning and although not completely packed with people it was pretty full. The sandwich was so good on Jewish rye. I wish there was a location closer to where I live and then I would be in trouble cuz I think I would be there every day. Great place to go with friends after a medical procedure. Great location! Great Food. Great Service!!!!!
4 ||| This is my favorite type of restaurant, regardless of cuisine; namely, a family run institution with great food, friendly service and an almost complete disinterest in spiffing up the surroundings. Yes, Pho Minh is a bit divey, and I relish this quality. The pho is great, as are all of the dishes I've tried here. I also have a deep appreciation for restaurants that do one cuisine and do it well...none of this Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese combo that only serves to confuse the diner as well as, often, the kitchen. Between this place and Tram's down the street, Pho Minh is my favorite. Pittsburgh has a woeful dearth of good restaurants...I'll try not to go on too much about that in my reviews, as I don't want your eyes to glaze over...so this is a destination restaurant for us. There are very few things more satisfying than a deep bowl of pho on a cold winter day.
1 ||| Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nThis is just a continuation of my previous review.  I had a due-out from it, so please read it as well for a total picture.\n\nSince this was a separate visit as well, let's talk about it in brief.  A burger is something I would expect any self-respecting BBQ place to do well.  Granted, to make one, it requires grilling, and not BBQing.  I guess this establishment just considers it beneath them to care about something as benign as a burger.\n\nIt's hard to excel at a burger, but it's also hard to mess one up.  Well, let me tell you of a few ways to lead down the wrong path as demonstrated here.  First, don't ask me how I want the burger done.  Typically if a burger is cooked beyond medium, it's because they're using an inferior meat.  Secondly, burger preparation is supposed to be minimalist, but not lacking entirely.  A waft of seasoning is all that's required, but I guess that doesn't work if all the burgers are the same preformed base for each menu version.  Thirdly, don't cook the heck out of a burger.  Luckily it wasn't fast food bad, but it was definitely poor workmanship.  Definitely not worth the price.\n\nThe hushpuppies didn't strike me as fresh, and they didn't have any semblance of being hand-made.  Yet, they did provide a medium in which to test their sauces, which I forgot to do on my first visit.  Their Original is far from its name-sake as it can it.  It takes just about like ever other BBQ sauce I've had (keep in mind I'm not a fan of any though).  The Red Sticky just seems like their Original mixed with some ketchup and maybe more (brown) sugar.  I honestly can't say if it made it better or worse.  Lastly, my \"favorite\" of the three would be their Spicy.  I wouldn't call it Spicy as in picante, but Spicy as in at least they put some spices in to give it flavor.\n\nI guess I should have ordered some of their slaw to remind me why I risked another visit in the first place..
4 ||| Very cool venue for the Yelp event. Such a good time playing with the exhibits and savoring the tasty bites! \n\nWell done yelp!
0 ||| Been here numerous times will not come back because of my greeter Daniel soooo rude! Just wanted the VIP wash and I understand they have to try to up sell but after telling him no 5 times he made a rude remark and walk away! Uncalled for!!! I will be going to Danny's or elsewhere from now on!
4 ||| So the Proprietor of my favorite Fish and Chips \"Joint\" (Marilyn's on Central) mentioned that his Sister runs one close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and this is it.\n\nWhat I said about Marilyn's:\n\n           The fish? OMG, the best! Have had all three varieties of Fish (Cod, Catfish and    \n           Whiting) but being from Boston, COD is my absolute favorite and this is the \n           very best \"Fried Cod\" I have ever had. Don't generally like Catfish, but Marilyn's \n           is terrific! Want to try ALL three, get the three pieces with one of each and you \n           will know which to order next time. The Owner has tremendous pride in what \n           he does and obviously, that can be seen in his \"Product.\" NOT fond of the  \n           Tartar Sauce, but doesn't matter because the Fish is so extraordinary. Unlike \n           most Fish and Chip joints in Phoenix, the do NOT use the same batter on \n           everything. Makes a BIG difference. \n\n           You just can't go wrong and if you are like me, you will get a craving every \n           couple of weeks. FABULOUS!\n\nThis is also true of Mandy's except that the Tartar sauce is better and YOU have to select what batter is used! While Cod (priced a little higher) is still my favorite, have tried the Whiting and it is pretty terrific as well!\n\nThey do have two locations, have only been to the Jefferson one and have never had anything other than Fish and Shrimp. Why would I?
2 ||| Uncle Sams is awesome. See my review of the Squirrel Hill location here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/uncle-sams-submarines-pittsburgh-2#hrid:0awQicUktjE9OTtI5GTkPQ\n\nThis one is not quite a good as it's brother in Squirrel Hill.  Mainly because it is a bit more run down and no waffle fries.
0 ||| Ick.\nI rarely ever just throw away my food, but most of my meal from House of Egg roll is now sitting in my trash can.\n\nI ordered sesame tofu, which sounded great. What I got was some hard triangles of tofu coated in about 10 sesame seeds and then dyed bright, glow-in-the-dark orange (which suspiciously looked, and tasted, exactly like the sweet-and-sour sauce that came with our egg rolls). ,\n\nThat was it. Nothing else, other than several florets of broccoli they put under the tofu. No, it wasn't cooked with the tofu and sauce, it was just plopped, raw, underneath everything. And there wasn't even really any gravy or sauce at all, so everything was dry.\n\nI want to give H.O.E.G. points for trying to be a bit more creative on the veggie options (Sesame tofu, orange tofu, etc) but if the food sucks, it doesn't really matter how good the menu appears.\n\nMy husband's order wasn't much better.\n\nThe egg rolls were pretty good, I'll admit.\n\nI should have stuck with Sun Chinese Dining. Sorry, Sun, I won't stray again...
0 ||| This was probably one of the worst Walmart I have ever been to. Inventory was very low, everything was out of order. And the biggest issue was trying to find someone who works there! I could have lived with the mess, customers act like the own the place and just throw things around. But when your're trying to find something with no success. It would be nice to have some help. \nNow this place is huge, one of those Super Walmart. One stop store that has both retail and grocery. Getting out was pretty easy, just went to one of the self check out. Not a big fan of the big box stores, but this location has a lot of issues.
0 ||| Joined on a groupon, went once and never went back.  Gym equipment was so old it brought back memories of the 70s.  \nTennis courts filled with rug rats and people who did not want to give way to anyone else wanting to hit.  Heated pool, big deal can crash a local resort hotel for that.  My expectations were not met, very disappointed.
3 ||| Safeway has been my store to shop at mostly because it is really close to my house. We have survived two remodels and the last one was not the greatest one.\n\nThe Starbucks could be bigger and so could the health food section. The produce is not always the freshest. The flowers are good but the roses have a tendency to wilt after a few days not high quality.\n\nOverall the staff is friendly and they know me. My market of choice
0 ||| I wish I could give Flora Bella a \"Minus Star\" rating.  My wedding is this Saturday, I just received an email from Rob saying \"oops, I just found your paperwork -- FROM JANUARY -- guess we dropped the ball and aren't doing your wedding.\"\n\nYa think??!!  Despite my venue -- Sanctuary on Camelback Resort -- recommending Flora Bella, and their agreement, in writing, to be the florist for my wedding, these guys completely dropped the ball.  Failed to send a proposal, or contract, left me hanging for over a month...\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND FLOWERS BY JODI!!!
2 ||| Small smokey casino off the strip.\nI'm sure it's mostly locals.\nChop Choy restaurant was good and somewhat cheap.\nProbably would not come back here.
4 ||| Went there for a business lunch and was very impressed.  They got us seated right away even though the parking lot was completely full.  It appeared to be a very popular business lunch location due to its location.  Our waiter was efficient but I did not feel rushed.  The atmosphere matched the menu.  The steak was outstanding and the portions were adequate for a lunch time meal.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their selection as I did.
4 ||| I have purchased 4 Lexus . I had a 2001 IS, a 2002 GS 300, a 2006 GS300 and just recently purchased a 2013 GS 350. Since 2001 I have been in a Lexus and as far as customer service, sales and just overall experience has met and really have been above my expectations. That is why I really want to stay in a Lexus forever. Every Lexus that I've owed I figure it would be my last, but some how, the sales staff are willing to work with you and make it achievable. If I have my way, I will stay in a Lexus and the product makes it easy to be a returning customer. I was able to make my deal through emails. I never walked into the dealership, until I was ready to pick up the car. I didn't want to test drive it, because I know the history of GS (since I had 2 previously), but my salesperson insist that I do, so I took it around the corner and just like I thought, this is a car that really hit all the marks and then some. Hendrick Lexus gets it and I just wished that the customer service I receive for my other new car (which I want mention) had 1/3 of Lexus customer service practice. I tried my best to convince my wife not to buy that Volvo..I didn't mean to type that. \nI have told all that will listen that Hendrick is the place to buy or service your car. I get my car washed, good service and people that listen to you. I was in Columbia and I stopped in that Lexus dealership for a car wash and not once did anyone asked did I purchase the car there, it's a Lexus and it was washed and delivered back to me clean as a pin. I want to thank Hendrick Lexus for being on top of your game and treating each customer with value! GREAT JOB and thank you Hendrick Lexus for your excellent customer service!
2 ||| I've figured Dan out - no matter what you ask for, you get the same haircut. It's not bad, its just, you know, the Pittsburgh special. Super friggin' short. I'm getting my tattoo sleeves finished this week to better fit in this city.
0 ||| OMG possibly the worst experience of my life.\nExtremely small, crowded club with barely five feet of floor area in front. Floor is sticky and more than likely, you'll get a drink spilled on you. Cover fee is ridiculous and I hear it's even more jacked up on special occasions like Homecoming and Dad's/Mom's Weekends. Better check the band that's playing before or you'll get stuck listening to country crap like \"Cornmeal.\" Ridiculous, deadbeat hippies rocking out to lyric-less songs.
0 ||| I would put negative star if available. The workers their are so rude ave are not costumer friendly.  Not to mention they don't even know their own merchandise.  There's a little crazy foreign last who works in their dressing room who needs to be fired.  Rudest old lady ever! Their management needs to be replaced,  if their employees can treat people like that.   I hate shopping there but when your on a budget,  you have no other choice.  Thumbs down twice!
2 ||| I'm so relieved that someone else noticed the fact that the tables are arranged not like desks in a classroom. I thought I was going crazy...coming in I saw maybe 15 people sitting down at 20 little identical tables, *all* in front of laptops...nearly all facing the same direction. All I could think was \"This must be what coffee shops in re-education camps look like\". (It's not *that* bad- and they have more traditional seating in the back; I think this is just how they've had to adjust to crowding.) Because of that, it took me a few minutes after taking myself to really feel comfortable. \n\nI had a tasty (and cheap, albeit small) pot of tea and sat down facing the opposite direction, just to be contrarian. Their wifi was free, which is a big plus, but they didn't have good power outlet access, which is a big minus. The staff was friendly, the selection of teas was phenomenal, but the music was just a bit too loud (and at some times, flat out awkward) for my tastes, and all in all, it just didn't quite click. I had gone there to get some reading done - I was able to get it done, which was good, but I didn't feel the desire to linger around once my work was done, which was bad. All in all, asi asi.\n\nI did see someone there reading a seminal paper in ubiquitous computing, so I have to vouch for the crowd (sorry, nerd pride). And the desks are actually well suited to getting serious work done (I imagine a big plus for a lot of people, given the number of laptops). But for me, I was really hoping to find a cozy place to escape the world while being productive - and for that, I'll have to keep looking.
0 ||| This is the deal and a very honest review no BS but the truth.  I have gone to Eastwind for years and the food was always decent.   Fast food sushi and a good place for lunch.     Well the place was just purchased by a new owner and the guy seems to not give a crap.  Never once has he come over to the table and said how's your food etc.   The people are not very friendly , and this is the honest truth.   I have been there about a dozen times since the new owners purchased it and they have not gotten the food order right once.  I order the same thing every time  a teriyaki chicken combo and a Mitzu soup with a drink.  One would think the soup would come out first but nope.  It all comes out at the same time and the last few times the food has been cold along with the soup.  Do they EVER APPOLIGIZE nope.  They really don't care and if they don't care I will find another place to go.  They just lost a two to three day a week customer.  Today was funny they forgot to bring my food out after waiting 20 + minutes.  They double delivered an order to the guy next to me.  Another table had to go up and complain three times to get their order.  It's like a circus of errors and comedy.
2 ||| Service -- not so much. :(\nFood - - we just stopped in for nachos, and they were super cheesy. \nMargarita - - 99c during happy hour 3pm-6pm. Meh! Tasted like a lot of sour mix, but what can you expect for 99c, right? \n\nThe nachos were $11.99, but then marked down $2 to $9.99 for happy hour. \n\nNeedless to say.. we've had better nachos. But really the lack of service will prevent us from coming back. \n\nWhat were we thinking? :)
4 ||| Yellowtail Tar Tar! Need I say more?! I could eat this all day. ALL DAY!! \nI came here quite awhile ago so I can't really remember all that I ate but I DO remember THAT much. Just come here for that!! Nom nom! \nOooh and the sashimi was VERY good too! Fresh and delicious tasting! \n\n\n\nI think they keep getting shut down by the SNHD though so......
0 ||| Everytime I go to this place (usually I go after 10) the people that give you your food are always rude and never give you what you're paying for. The two men that take your order are always nice (older gentleman and African American man). When I got my frostys (best part about Wendy's) they were only half way full and instead of the young man filling them the rest of the way up he argued with me that that's how they do them even though every other time I get them and he's not there they are filled all the way! Terrible customer service most of the time. I would not recommend going to this location. After my visit tonight I don't think I will be returning to this location! HORRIBLE.
4 ||| This was my first time staying at a Hyatt (obviously been living under a stone the past 40 years!!)  - smooth check in, no paperwork to sign, all good, easy, swift, high ceilings, nice ambiance, friendly friendly people. . . \n\nVery very relaxing. . .   nice and calm, not a lot of people about so obviously not the busy season but we didn't want to leave.\n\nWill stay here again.\n\nx
2 ||| We have dined at this Flemings location numerous times before and had wonderful experiences, however, this time things fell very flat.  Things started off fine with water and a wine list that was provided via Ipad.  My fiance's mother asked the waitress for wine recommendations and she wasn't able to help ( it seemed like she wasn't too familiar with the selection).  Ordering food was fairly quick and easy.  Once we received our steaks, the waitress informed us about the lava cake that takes 20 minutes to cook, and told us she would check back in shortly to see if we were interested.  We didn't see her again for at least 30 minutes. \n\nI know, I know.  When people usually say 30 minutes they are grossly overestimating out of frustration; however, we actually did wait that long.  So long in fact, it began to get awkward at the table.  All the food was consumed and our wine glasses were empty, yet our waitress was nowhere in sight.  When she did finally show, it was too late to order the lava cake.  We instead ordered two plates of creme brulee and two desserts to go, along with a cup of coffee.  The coffee was cold, and it took 10 minutes to get a new hot cup.  Once dessert was finished we again were left waiting around for our waitress; waiting to clear dishes, waiting to receive the check, and again, waiting to pay the check.  In all it took us two hours to have a simple meal, and that was not by choice.  \n\nThe food was great, per usual, but the service was just downright bad.
0 ||| My boyfriend and I visited for the first time ever on Thursday. I work for Darden, so I was expecting great service and delicious food. The food was nothing amazing, but it was still a decent value for the price. However, our waiter was extremely rude. He acted like it was a burden to serve us. I'm assuming it was our age, but that shouldn't matter. I'm a server myself and it's wrong to treat your guests like they are wasting your time. It made the entire experience quite disappointing.
3 ||| We got married here last week and our party of 29 had a wonderful time.  Rhonda had set us up to the side but there were occupied tables next to us.  Seemed odd at first but in a way fun to have others share in our celebration, with several of them congratulating us afterward.  Everyone enjoyed their dinners of either flat iron steak or swordfish which I heard was perfectly cooked. Our wedding cake was both beautiful and delicious.  Thank you!
2 ||| If I had to sum up my childhood dining experience I could do it in two words 'Avenue Bar.' Man, everytime I'm in here, I feel like my grandparents are going to come around the exposed brick corner drinking the signature old fashioneds. And you know how Appleby's started that thing where they throw a bunch of 'old' shit around and it looks all nostalgic but has no substance? Well, the crap that litters this bar is all authentic and been there for decades. The Avenue is jam packed, noisy and has mounted fish on the walls. The Friday night scen is insane, but so worth the wait. Get the cod for your fish fry choice and be prepared to drill some new holes in your belt.
2 ||| Food court pizza, it is what it is. In this case, a very light and too fluffy crust that is 3/4 of an inch thick. The mushroom & spinach was probably the best choice.\n\nBut it's a food court, so choices are limited.
4 ||| One of my all time favorite Chinese takeout places!  \nI have moved away from Madison and still crave the food.  My sister and I would eat there at least once a week and every time I come home I make it a point to stop here.  I recommend the vegetarian broccoli dish and my sister is obsessed with General Tso's Chicken. I also love hot Jasmine tea they have for you while you wait.  Perfect to cut through the crisp (emphasis) Wisconsin air. ;)  If you are looking for a great takeout place look no further!
1 ||| You get what you pay for - no-frills basics but it works. The night staff could use some customer service training.  I have no excuse to stay here again and certainly would pursue other options if looking in the area.
3 ||| I've yet to try Woodlands, so Maharani is currently my go-to Indian in Charlotte (mostly because it's right around the corner).  I've only ever had their lunch buffet, and I've been pleased both with the price (LOVE) and number of vegetarian options.  Fully half the buffet is veg, which is more than I can say of other Indian buffets.\n\nThe curries were decent but less spicy than I would like.  With that said, I have to echo others in raving about their samosas, which were the spiciest thing on the buffet and were truly revelatory.  I would go back to Maharani simply for the samosas, hands-down.\n\nThe people that own it seem nice.
4 ||| Fried rice and duck is awesome!
3 ||| Get the fattoush with chicken!!! \n\nI have now been to this eatery a total of 4 times and I have enjoyed each and every visit.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the safhi that I had ordered as an appetizer the meat was a little dry. It still tasted wonderful but the meat seemed like it was reheated....\n\nGreat trendy atmosphere and heala good food yumm-o\n\nThe vegetable salata at Aladdin's is to die for.
2 ||| WOW.  We had read alot of reviews about Kai, and they are were positive and we were really beginning to wonder.  It's pretty strange that this place only has positives reviews.  There were a few reviews criticizing the decor, but nothing about the food...\n\nWell, here I am, another positive review.  We were there Saturday night for the Journey with Expanded Wine Lists.   What a journey it was.  Every dish was so unique.  There were Native American ingredients that were incorporated into dishes - but the flavors of 'basic' components were incredible.   So reading the menu is very deceptive, because the dish name may be \"mushrooms\" or \"tomatoes\" but what you get is an experience in your palate and on your plate.\n\nThe service was impeccable.  They repeatedly called us by name when they served and came to table to explain or ask things.  It was extremely coordinated and overall a pleasure to experience.\n\nWe constantly travel out of state for fine dining experiences, and had no clue that a fine dining experience that rivals Fleur de Lys, Moto was in our backyard!!   It wasn't pretentious, but classy and friendly.\n\nIt was a beautiful evening, and we can't wait to go back once the temperatures cool down, since it looks like they have outdoor seating, and the view is spectacular. \n\nThe Sheraton hotel has some issues to work out (we spent the night - had to after all that wine - driving wasn't really an option) but they do make good to resolve their mistakes..
4 ||| Old Navy is one of those places that I totally forgot existed until my sister became employed there. Now, I shop here at least twice a month. They are forever having some kind of clearance or sale going on and they a lot of sizes. I believe they go from an XS to a XXL, however, if they do not have your size in stock, they will call over to the West side Old Navy or order it for you online. I have found it that online does have more plus size apparel. They sale shoes, accessories, skirts, dresses, shorts, hats, bags, graphic t-shirts and so on. Great store to go to if you're looking for a nice spring dress for a great price. You can also apply for a credit card and get approved immediately.
0 ||| called at 11:50 am to make an appointment. i selected option #1 to schedule an appointment. the line was picked up and hung up 3 times.  All of a sudden the three lines i have to the office were all busy.  Who ever is handling the reception desk today September 3, 2014 should be fired.
0 ||| NO customer service at all. The salesmen don't know their cars and trucks. What's worse was that the Branch Manager was so rude to his employees - in front of the us. That really turned us off. We went straight to NIssan and bought my sister's truck at Nissan that same day.
0 ||| The worst brisket I have ever encountered. Sometimes, the run down shack atmosphere with the dirt parking lot places are where the best food is found, but in this case the crappy outside matches the lousy food inside this terrordome. The entire brisket sandwich combo platter was a complete mess. I heard bells ringing in the back of this place which indicated my brisket was being nuked and then placed on the sesame bun from the grocery store. There was so much fat on this brisket that nothing was edible at all. I mean, fat ripped through every lousy strip of the gross meat that they claim was smoked on premises. There was some very yellow potato salad that was served as my side dish and it tasted very relishy, but not homemade as the the one employee said. A place just can't really operate with one employee either. It's time to raize this shack and let someone build something pretty and nice in this rundown neighborhood. worst brisket ever.
2 ||| Sooo... Ok. I live Mexican food. I grew up in Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are high. That being said I assume most places are gonna be bad so that if they are good I'm quite happy.... And if they aren't well... That's what I expected. \n\nThis place made me happy and quite upset at the same time. I'll start at the beginning. The chips... Kinda bad. They were super dry and weird. Super weird consistency and zero salt. Our second basket was better, but still lacking. The salsa was ok... Not amazing but not bad. Margaritas were good and seemed to be on the strong side which no one should complain about....ever.\n\nMy burrito was actually alright. I had the carnitas burrito and it was good. It needed a bit of spicing up so it asked for hot sauce and another margarita when the waiter checked back. He said no problem. A few min pass and he brings my margarita and says he'll be right bam with the hot sauce. Ok... I'm eating very slowly because I want that hot sauce. It's now been probably 10 min since my margarita came. I don't like eating slow... And I finally say screw it and finish eating. He comes and takes my plate away... And then he brings me the hot sauce to the table. I mean really?\n\nBottom line, Drinks: Yay! Food: Ehh. Service: Booooo!
2 ||| I got the Carne Asada taco dinner. Pretty good. Was still kind of hungry though. The house margarita was below average. Service was good. I'd go back to drink, but thought the food was pricey for the amount you get.
3 ||| Food is not so authentic but the best there is in Madison.
3 ||| Best friend and I were shopping and as that's such a strenuous activity we worked up quite an appetite.  She'd been talking about the wings at this place for a whole week since she first tried them so we decided to go so I could check it out too.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside and it'd be easy to miss so make sure you're looking closely!\n\nIt's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside which I was happy about because no one likes a cramped eating space.  We were greeted and seated right away which is always nice and the hostess was friendly.  Our server arrived quickly as well and was also pleasant.  My friend decided on the Honey Hot boneless wings and I went with Medium, we also wanted to try out the pizza so we split a 10\" Pepperoni.\n\nThe food came out pretty fast which was good because we were hungry.  The wings were a good size, perfectly crispy with the right amount of sauce and they had a great flavor.  The pizza was delicious as well.  We polished off the whole thing and I'm justifying it by telling myself it was small so it's okay.  My only tiny little pet peeve (and this is going to make me sound like a diva...) is that the water tasted like unfiltered tap water.  I hate to bring that up but Arizona water does have it's own special \"flavor\" and it just wasn't great.  With the exception of that though I loved everything about this place and I will certainly be back soon.
0 ||| Went to have dinner here last night with my family to celebrate the Union of my mother and her husband. With that said we checked in as there were many people waiting inside and outside to be seated. The hostess asked how many people we reply 10 adults 5 children. The hostess so 15, she explained that there was no table at this time where she could seat all of us together, but if we get on a waiting list she could make this happen, but the wait was an hour long, great we will wait since this place has great food, prides themselves in customer service. Let me just tell you after waiting over an hour we finally were seated in one area three different tables. This was explained to the person seating us that we waited so that 1. we could sit as a family 2. celebrate my mothers wedding 3. Who wants to sit away from there family on a joyous occasion. We asked to speak to the manger, we got Janelle. I highly doubt she was a manager nor a supervisor since her communication skills are lacking and eye contact is non existent. She only wanted to talk to the person who spoke with the hostess since her hostess makes it known that they cannot seat a family of 15 at one table, which was not verbally communicated to any of us at the time of check in and when the hostess stated she could seat us together, we as the customer should of known that  three or four tables in the same area is sitting together. Well that didn't sit well with me because I don't know how you do it in your family but when you go out to have dinner after waiting an hour wouldn't you expect to sit with your family. Her response was it depends.\nI laughed I said it depends she said yes and what would we like to do. I would like to sit with my family we came to celebrate, eat great food, and toast to this union. Thanks to Janelle that did not happen. We want to thank her for ruining our experience of waiting and not accommodating the customer nor did she apologize for the inconvenience, but stated that we were more than welcome to leave! Janelle we did just that, we left and went to another restaurant thanks to you! As I left I told her next time that someone speaks to her look at them in their eyes and make sure that she has some type of remorse and communication with the customer! she said thanks have a good night.\nThank you Janelle representative of Texas Road House for your hospitality. \n\nAlso in case the family of 13 that were before us has not done so they were also rejected by Janelle.
0 ||| Came here today to buy a new bra. Did not end up getting one thanks to the despicable condescending wretch who was working the fitting room. This woman should not have a job working with people.
4 ||| I was in town on business, and had nothing to do in Las Vegas on a sunday. I wanted to avoid the overpriced/pretentious cigar shops which (aren't bad at all) within the casino/strip scene, \n\nI highly recommend En Fuego Cigars off Sahara Ave. I got a tip from a bartender at the Wynn about this place, and upon arrival, I see they have a whole setup where they roll their own stuff. Of course I had to try a house stick, and it was fantastic... En Fuego Cigar is their label, enfuegolasvegas.com\n\nScott who was the guy managing it, was super nice, and in a blink of an eye, I was there for 3 hours, hanging out with a great bunch of guys. I walked out of there with a sampler of their house brand, and already it's on my re-order list!!!!! Michael the owner was very cool to insure I was a happy customer!!
3 ||| This review is for the chain in general. I will post it here as this is probably the Noodles I have been to the most. I have been to all the Noodles locations in town at least five times and to Noodles in general about 60-80 times over ten years or so.\n\nConsistently fresh and tasty food. Good service. Fast. Easy to customize the pasta (and add lots of veggie). Good value unless you add too many extras. Great pasta. Nice restaurants. Many have outside seating. \n\nThey are a little stingy with veggies that you pay extra for. The extra meat could be cooked better into the meal instead of just lying on top. menu does not change too much so if you go too much you can Noodled out. \n\nDeserves a 4.5 stars (yelp, gives half stars would make giving fair ratings  easier), but is a little closer to 4 than 5.
4 ||| I've been to many nail salons looking for the best place with reasonable prices & I actually like this place. The only downsides to this nail salon is the wait time since they have so many loyal customers & the extremely strong smell of chemicals (I'm pretty sure they have to open their door everyday). Other than that, I find myself going back for their customer service, reasonable prices & wide selection of acrylic nail designs.
3 ||| Nice location, interesting cocktail menu, but nothing is done particularly well. I still go there, but I wish the cocktails were made using fresher ingredients.
4 ||| Tried this place the other day and the food here is very delicious. It's around the corner from my house. Another mom and pop business that we should be supporting. Service was superb and the food is great !
2 ||| The Open Kitchen offered decent Italian food, but I wouldn't call it \"world famous\".  The atmosphere was the best part of my visit.  I loved the brick interior.  The servers were kind and attentive, but it's worth noting that our party of four was served after nearly 20 minutes of waiting, and with only a handful of other guests in the restaurant at the time (weekday for lunch).\n\nI ordered the cheese-stuffed cannelloni and I thought it to be an acceptable dish, but I can't say I'd ever go back there again.  I've had better, cheaper Italian elsewhere in Charlotte.
0 ||| This hotel sucks. If I could give it a 0 I would. The hotel was in a unique area of town. There were some weirdos near the hotel. I saw people just hanging around and stuff. I also saw a lady just posted up. She was looking at every care riding past. She was either trying to get some drugs or looking to turn a trick. The room also sucked and had a big sign that said MAKE SURE YOU LOCK YOUR DOORS. I was ready to get out of there. Thank god we left at 5 30 the next morning.
4 ||| I LOVE this place! Best Gyros, hot dogs and their home made zucchini are amazing! Not one speck of grease on anything! It looks scary on the outside but it is very clean and well taken care of!
4 ||| I tried the gyro. It was delicious. The food seems better than the othe Greek places I've been to.
4 ||| If you are interested in Native American history and culture you need to visit.     I have been to the National Museum of Native Americans in Washington DC.      The Heard runs a close second in their exhibits.    You should put the Heard on your places to see when in Phoenix.
1 ||| Thematically this place really hits the mark but service wise, I don't think you can even expect the bartenders to remember who ordered what drink. The music was offensively awful and the first room you enter is claustrophobically small. As for the prices I'm sure that the volcano cost more than it should of and despite having little tolerance I didn't get much out of it buzz wise. In fact ordering it was a pretty big pain in the ass. We did not really feel comfortable in the area that this bar is located after the sunset.
0 ||| For the love of gawd...what crappy, sub-par sushi that is over priced. Lunch cost me and my girlfriend $70, no specials but one roll and the sushi was equivalent to a buffet style sushi at a cheap oriental place. Just to get the taste out of our mouths and get our sushi fix we went to Stingray in Old town Scottsdale and the quality, service, larger portions and lower cost turned it all around for us.
4 ||| Thank you Rob and company for making my day today. Anyone looking for a Rolex, Patek or any other beautiful watch should look no further than Hamra. They have everything, are passionate and knowledgeable, and extraordinarily helpful. Very happy with my experience and Rolex purchase today.
4 ||| I had almost stopped eating Pizza because it was so difficult to find really good Pizza anywhere in Virginia.  When I relocated to Phoenix and a friend recommended Fatso's I didn't expect to find Pizza I could love again!  \n\nThe thin crust is perfect, the cheese not too greasy or too salty and the pepperoni is cooked just right for me.  I like it crispy like bacon.  The green peppers are fresh and the sauce tasty.  Can't ask for more than that!  \n\nI've eaten in a few times and the service has been sporadic.  My first time the service was fast and attentive, the last time just the opposite.  The waitress seemed to have better things to do.  The times in between were nothing memorable so the service must have been adequate. \n\nThe live music is fun and they change musicians enough to allow for conversation in between singers.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the sporadic service.
4 ||| My husband took me here for my bday this past w/e. We went with a few other people and had a great time...minus the drink crashing to the dance floor the drunk cousin-in-law let slip! Dancing, huge variety of people, everyone laidback. I would say definitely a couple place or just a place to kick it with your friends, not to pick up ladies/gents.  I would have liked to stay here longer but we didn't :( \n\nIt was great seeing the couples that knew how to dance! I will definitely be going back.
1 ||| Last time I went I was very disappointed in the service. We had a large group so I can understand it taking a little longer than normal but our server took forever to ask us what we wanted to drink (we were a little later than the rest of the party who already had a drink). Also all the TVs were on a preface channel while there was another game that was actually on. I don't think I'd ever pick to go there again. Will only go if someone else wants to.
4 ||| I'm a NJ/NY native and never met a red velvet cake or cupcake that wasn't dry - until now! I first sampled a bite a few months back at a Baby Show where Nothing Bundt Cakes was a vendor. I went back yesterday and got a red velvet bundtlet and it's to die for. I can't wait to go back for other flavors. The storefront was clean and the owner is friendly - five stars!
2 ||| My god, paint the freakin place... It's incredible how many places don't get atmosphere... I don't want to eat at K-mart (nor do i want to shop at K-mart). What does a few gallons of paint and some decent lighting cost anyway? And update the bar! It is sad when a business owner loses that spark.\n\nAlright, had a few pills... mellowed now...\n\nThe food is good - not great - but certainly a paradise of selection for all the vegetarians out there (must be 100 items on the menu). The pricing is amazingly cheap (maybe they could add 10 cents to each dish for paint). The menu threw me at first, as each dish is described as chicken, beef, shrimp, etc.. with a small disclaimer on the front of the menu that they are meat-substitutes.\n\nAnyone else want to donate some time to help spruce this place up (yes, it bugs me that much).
4 ||| I eat lots of sub sandwiches but I usually opt for the more famous chain which will remain nameless but it starts with Sub and ends it Way (and the word is subway) which happens to be about a block down the street. \n\nHow foolish of me to go to a chain when Sub Factory is right in my neighborhood. \n\nThe subs are 10'' on white or wheat with a large selection, most subs starting at only 4.89! That's a good deal! I had the steak and cheese which was loaded with peppers, grilled onions and lots of meat. \n\nPictures of \"old\" Tempe (i.e. probably from the 80s and 90s) hung on the wall. There are a few ways to my heart and an appreciation of local history is one of them. So are good sub sandwiches. I'm now in love with Sub Factory and I'm going to go there a lot more. \n\nThe girl working was very nice and genuinely smiled and thanked me when I left. \n\nSo this is a major win and a great new discovery for me.
3 ||| Had a few experiences here and all were pretty good.\n\nI had a $5 off coupon to use for their signature service (I asked its actually their only service) It runs $37 regularly and includes checking some things and filling up fluids. I felt it was a bit pricey since I remember paying $15-20 for oil changes but since I was crunched for time I did it anyway.\n\nThey were extremely friendly there- showing me to the little waiting room and offered me fresh coffee and good magazines.\n\nThey  pulled out my filter to show it to me..which I expected to have to replace, but happily was told it looked good and nothing needed to be done : ) \n\nI was in and out in about 10min or so...I would be happy to return
4 ||| Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \n\nOur first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\n\nThe food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\n\nOur order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \n\nThe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\n\nAs far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \"Lumpy Dog\" to a dark \"Brew masters Choice.\"  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\n\nI give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.
2 ||| Let me start by saying I think I just had a subpar experience. This is a little lengthy, but hear me out.\n\nI went here with 4 other adults. Three of us arrived and sat and the other 2 joined within about 5 minutes. We waited hardly any time for someone to take our drink order, but there was a significant wait for our order. I order the pancake breakfast with eggs over hard, bacon, and I tried to order home fries with no onions. I was told that was not possible to do without onions. I asked if there were any potato options without onions and she said no. So I asked if I could get corned beef hash instead and she was going to charge me as a side (full price, not a sub price). I didn't want to tack on an extra $5.25 to my price and didn't think that was completely fair so I passed. The options I was given were a side of tomatoes or fruit, which I didn't want either. I asked if I could just get extra bacon and she agreed. I feel like these are pretty lame options just because someone doesn't like onions, but such is my life. Then after asking for bacon the waitress said \"there are onions in the corned beef hash anyway.\" Uh, ok. Not sure why that wasn't mentioned when I asked to get them. That would have saved a lot of back and forth.\n\nThe food finally arrives and it looks great. The syrup on the other hand.... not good. It came with 2 very large pancakes and I was given 2 small packs of kraft syrup. The syrup was nasty. It was thicker than honey and had to be spread with a knife. My mom had the same meal and told the waitress, \"um the syrup....\" and she interrupted and said \"oh, I know what you're going to say\" and quickly walked off. She came back with a pack warmed up from hot water. It made no difference at all. Hot or lukewarm, the syrup was thick and nasty. It was a below average pancake experience, which I didn't know was even possible. To make this not a complete bitch-fest, the eggs and bacon were cooked right at least.\n\nThe waitress was busy and believe me, I have very reasonable expectations from servers since I used to work in a restaurant. She was very short with us. She was foreign so I know that is a factor, but sometimes you need to show some empathy when you have to tell someone bad news, or when they ask things from you.\n\nI have heard such great things from Weiss deli that I was looking forward to eating here, but was let down. If I could make a recommendation to them would be to have better syrup, and able to pour from a container. The syrup was so thick and messy (and not tasty) my hands were sticky, and the bathroom was locked so I couldn't wash them. \n\nI would come here again, but I wouldn't order the same thing. I tasted my husband's french toast and it was very good. He had strawberries and whip cream on them so he didn't use the syrup. I noticed most of their food had onions, so I think my choices would be limited if they won't let me hold the onions. I'm not in a hurry to come back though.
1 ||| Vegas locals are nuts about Luv-it.  But to be honest, I don't really get it.  Don't get me wrong, anything frozen and sweet is a score in this heat.  \n\nHowever, they don't have much variety of flavors.  I've been there a few times after 9 pm and the shop ran out of most of its flavors, leaving me with chocolate and vanilla to choose from.  That's a little annoying.  And, while I get that custard is different than ice cream, the taste of Luv-it custard isn't really distinct enough to celebrate.\n\nHowever, the sundaes are pretty amazing.  The nut topping is freshly toasted and the fudge isn't too sweet.
4 ||| Food is definitely authentic & very good. Salsa was too watery for my liking & not very zingy. Burritos were HUGE!!!
1 ||| if you decide you're in the mood for Italian food and olive garden is on your list, you should be shot on site.\ni didn't even like this place when i was 10, which seems odd, because their commercials seem to target that age group...and not in a \"this place is kid friendly\" way, but in a \"you are so uninspired and so afraid of taking your palette out of your comfort zone, you might as well be a 10 year old\" kind of way.\nbread sticks are so oversalted they might as well be serving a salt lick, and from what i remember the salad was always limp and slightly brown.\ni think i just really, really loathe chain restaurants, especially gimmicky ones that shamelessly try to capitalize on notions of making eating an experience...which isn't wrong in and of itself, but this place is so off the mark from that idea it's a virtual sin
4 ||| The place may be small but the food and the service is second to none. The teriyaki chicken is the best in town. Appetizers are so good along with the house fried rice. This place need to be on diners drive-ins and dives show!!
3 ||| Why we keep coming back here when we're in Vegas, I'm not quite sure... and we're always here on Thanksgiving nonetheless!! Be warned people - it's cash only!!\n\nThe food is \"okay\" but really, I've definitely had better Chinese food. And of course, being in Vegas, there's great food everywhere! But why do we keep coming back you say? They can accommodate a large party AND it's cheap!\n\nIf you come for dinner on Thanksgiving (not that many of you would) be prepared for a bit of a wait!\n\nThe honey walnut shrimp had too much mayo, the fried rice is a small portion, the sweet and sour pork was pretty good, the house special chow mein was great... everything else we had was unremarkable.
2 ||| I wasn't impressed but tried going three different times. Food is ok service is fair and cost is a little much for what you get.
0 ||| Ok, i know what you are thinking... I get what I pay for right? Well this place royally sucks. I went in just to get  my bangs trimmed and I am not sure what the girl did. Actually she had no idea what she was doing and as we were talking I learned she went to cosmetology school as her 7th period class in high school. I though about calling and complaining but i did not want to get a young girl fired. Honestly DO NOT GO HERE. \nAlso, my fiance goes to the manager to get his hair cut the last time he went the manager said that she could not take him because she was \"training\" but the other girl could, there was no other customer in the shop. For a place that gets such a little business I do not think they should be turning clients away. Honestly this place should be shut down. Worst hair experience I have ever had.
1 ||| I came into the restaurant a few days ago and I was served by a girl named Katie. She had long, black hair and she seemed to hate me. Idk what I did to her but she would scream at me whenever I would try and order anything. One time she bent down to pick up a menu and I saw her ENTIRE asscrack! Talk about bad service. The only reason I would ever come back is because of the sweet blonde hostess girl. Mad props to her.
3 ||| This place is just awesome!!  I buy all of my D&D books here and most of my other books too.  The kids section is pretty cool and they have little toys and crafts that you wouldn't find at most other places.  The people who work here are awesome!!  I have never found anyone to be condescending or hard to approach.  Sure, some of the workers have tattoos and wild hair sometimes.  But you shouldn't judge a book by its cover...lol, I'm Fraking hilarious.
4 ||| Excellent food and a very good price. We go here at least twice a month. My kids also love the food!
4 ||| I am just returning from my third stay at this excellent Hyatt property.  All three of my stays have been with two of my old fashionista girlfriends--we look forward to the drive up to Scottsdale every 6 months.  I am a Platinum Gold Passport member--all of my stays have been free nights with Hyatt's reward program--and the best part is that we've never been treated like we are staying there for free.  The staff at this hotel is superb.  They are impeccably professional.  \n\nHighlights of our last visit (8/20/10):\n*complimentary margarita at check-in\n*upgraded room with a great view of the lagoon complete with lily pads and ducks paddling around\n*breakfast is always divine and a great splurge\n*no extra charge for a roll-away bed\n\nRegarding the upgraded room, at check-in Rosemarie told us we'd have a great view of the lagoon, but when we reached the room all we saw was a tennis court.  I immediately called down and she sent up new keys as she had sent us to the wrong room.  \n\nI travel every other 7 days--so I see a lot of hotels. This is in my top 5 of hotels EVER.  The staff is excellent, attentive without fawning. The food is delicious, well worth the prices you pay at a resort. The pool and grounds are beautiful and relaxing.  The rooms are clean, modern, comfortable; the amenities are perfect.  There are even small refrigerators in each room. The housekeeping staff are kind, attentive, and thorough.  \n\nThe hotel offers several activities for people visiting Arizona, including a Friday evening performance by local Native Americans.  A young 14 year-old boy performed the Hoop Dance; his performance was evocative and stunning.  I've lived in Arizona for 12 years and never seen anything like it.  Another gentleman performed a traditional Tohono song and it was both eery and enchanting.  You should definitely check that performance out.  Prior to the Native American performances, a wildlife curator shows off no less than a plethora of desert animals to include a LIVE alligator, a komodo dragon, a gila monster, a desert tortoise and too many snakes for one person to even concentrate on.  I've seen a lot of creepy-crawly things in hotel bars, but \nthis was a group of reptiles I actually appreciated.   \n\nThis hotel is not only a great place to stay it is also a great experience.
4 ||| Wow, here's a place I hadn't been in in a long time! I think 2006 was the last time. I had a great experience here. The last time, a man from Australia, sat next to me & we talked like we were old friends! Great friendly place. \nI need to come back & visit because it's right next to the pawnshop I go to sometimes....I will very soon, indeed!
0 ||| This place id FILTHY!!! All the teenies working there need to get off their phones and maybe wipe a table off? Went for a blizzard and there was not one clean table. SERIOSLY?
1 ||| Unbelievably disappointed.  I'm in town for business, and went on a week night.  They were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, I was treated quite poorly.  Mostly ignored during my meal, I had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill.  Not once did anyone check on my meal (I would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway.  \nI did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible.  Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service.\nI travel to Madison Wi frequently for work, and I can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me.
1 ||| I was sitting outside of Macy's and decided to walk over to this store. I figured it was more of a kids store, mostly for boys.  Whoa!  It was a few days before Halloween, and it looked like a Fredrick's of Hollywood wanna be. \n\nHalloween aside -- this place came off as a low class and raunchy.  Was that really the intent of your business plan?  Did you feel you executed it well?  Who is your market demo anyway?  I mean really?  Ugh!
1 ||| Was definitely not four star worthy good. I wouldve given it two stars but the service is pretty good. Don't remember much about the meal besides the fact that nothing was all that awesome. Honey toast=not as amazeballs as everyone makes it out to be. Woah 3 inch toast! Big whoop..... Bottom line, ichiza isn't the best but it apparently appeals to the las Vegas crowd and that's all that matters right? Don't come here expecting amazing izakaya style food. Want to visit a good izakaya? Go to LA.
2 ||| I just need to say that what ever that sauce is that they serve with the fried tofu... Oh God! I would bathe in it if I could. Anyway. That sauce aside, the food is pretty good but it's not the best I've ever had. The parking situation kind of sucks which is a slight turn off as well. I've been a few times and tried a few different menu items and they all rate about the same in my book... those little cookie/wafer things they give you with the check though are really good. In fact, I think I might head over to Lee Lee's to pick some up =)
2 ||| Pros: Easy to find, reasonable prices, close to my home, always has available parking\n\nCons: I used to come here because it was the closest to my home. I just had to stop. They messed up my clothes 30% of the time, but I still kept coming. However, they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants I brought in one time. When I tried to bring it to their attention, they argued that it was the way I washed the pants. I had not even worn the pants or washed them.
3 ||| I know it's a chain, but it lit up my Yelp choices and I knew that this was the place to catch my Phoenix breakfast. They have a huge menu and it took me a little bit to decide. I really wanted the Eggs Benedict, but detoured slightly and had the Sunrise Benedict instead. They replace the grilled ham with grilled sliced turkey and top it with a few slices of avocado. With a pile of country potatoes on the plate, it was AWESOME. I was stuffed all morning for sightseeing in the Valley of the Sun.\n\nFree wifi worked well.\n\nTip: Try and sit in the solarium area. It's only a view of the parking lot, but it's much sunnier than sitting deep in the restaurant.
0 ||| Complete and utter letdown. \n\nI was in the area, and needed a few items that are WF specific, so I thought, \"Even though it's Tempe, a WF should be good, right?\"\n\nWRONG!\n\nAt first glace, this looks like your typical WF. Then you walk in, and realize it's like the worst nose job on the history of the planet.\n\nThe vitamin section is completely disorganized. The staff is constipated. The lady helping me was pregnant, and very moody. Probably because she was due to give birth in Aisle 6 within moments. I didn't appreciate her rude attitude when she said, \"We dont sell that here. If you want to find it, try another store.\" \n\nJeez Louise. Ok. Fine. I will.\n\nAs I was leaving, I was a little hungry, so I popped over to the prepared foods section. Everything looked old, lifeless and disgusting. Hardened mac n cheese, overly cooked chicken, and a VERY dirty salad bar.\n\nI'm not coming back. Perhaps it's Tempe. Call me Elitist, but I have higher standards than bitchy people, shitty food, and a miserable experience. I move on from situations like this, whenever possible.
3 ||| I have wondered what this place was like for a long time--Glad I listened to the fellow yelpers. The meat lasagna was marvelous! We have a great family recipe and are always very critical of other lasagnas--as many others know few can compare to a good homemade lasagna but this one is outstanding.\n\nTry it out some night, stop in and pick up the premade lasagna, cook it at home for the family. It was $19 for a platter that could feed a family of 6 comfortably. You could also get the individual serving to taste if you don't believe me.
2 ||| What ever...I LOVE to have a seat and not worry about the bad hairy guy in front of me. Of course I had a warning that my sit would have \"obstructed view\" (Who the hell was the architect?). Luckily, we had a bad angle obstruction, but we were able to watch the band really close, jam and my favorite...NO LINES IN THE GIRLS BATHROOM!!  A big idea that compensates the \"obstructed view\" issue.\n\nBesides...I just came from the Killers concert and most ppl in my section don't even jam, so assigned sits are fine for statues.
3 ||| I am addicted to coffee. I know, it's a problem! :D Buuut I wouldn't say I'm an expert. So excuse my own way of describing what I like and don't like. \n\nThe coffee here is the perfect \"strongness\". The taste is perfect for me, strong enough without being bitter and gross. They have a great variety of espresso drinks like mochas, black and whites, mint, etc. All really good. The baristas have quite the showmanship. They are quick, precise, and do some cool tricks as well! \n\nThe atmosphere is okay. Fine to study but not exactly cozy to hang out. There is free wifi which is a plus.
0 ||| I love Paradise Bakeries everywhere else, except for this one. We stopped by for breakfast during the holiday season. The muffins were dry and tasted worse than the ones they give you on the flight, the tea was yuck and the croissant did not look or taste fresh. Have had better. \n\nWill not be getting my future breakfast fixes here before a trip from Sky Harbor.
3 ||| YUM!\n\nMaybe it's just because we had extra sauce and extra cheese added to our pizza, but it was AMAZING.  Thick crust, flavorful sauce, tons of cheese - and they deliver?!  I'm in heaven.\n\n*Update:  We are outside of their delivery area.  : (
0 ||| Given the Hooters reputation, this was a disappointment, especially for Vegas. Service was average and the food was too. Our orders came out incorrectly the first time. The second time, they were scattered so we didn't have our meal together.  We originally planned to dabble in the casino with their rewards card promo, but it's quite the catch. You gamble the money and you might get back fifty percent of your net loss. Meh. Not interested. Not worth visiting at all.
4 ||| If you've never been to a brewpub, then maybe the shiny casks behind the windows will intrigue you and you'll be overwhelmed by the awesomeness of the idea of a brewpub as you ask your server what they have that is like bud light.\n\nIf you are looking for great craft beer, theres more and more brewpubs popping up around town which are worth your attention.
3 ||| Fast cut and only $13\n\nIs it was it is.  I'm pretty bald these days, so I don't really care too much.  They write down the way you got it cut before, so if you don't like make sure they know.  Its a chain, so they can be found where ever/whenever.
4 ||| We had Easter breakfast here today with all the fam (11 ppl) kids & adults & everybody left happy with full bellies! The service was outstanding, our waiter (taller young guy) was refreshingly well mannered & very attentive to all our carious requests. We sat on the patio, which was spacious & nicely shaded. The food was delicious & we had quite a variety! Their toast is made with fresh bread baked in their bakery, as was my bagel and both were excellent! We make every effort to support locally and/or family owned restaurant when possible, we'll definitely be returning to Weiss!
0 ||| I feel this hospital really needs to realize who pays their bill. Their front desk people are very rude. When a customer walks in you should acknowledge them. Don't just ignore them for 10 minutes and tell them to sign in.  Definitely need to train the staff on customer service.
4 ||| High production values, great plays, wonderful acting, PICT offers a lot to theater fans in Pittsburgh.  They perform at the Stephen Foster Memorial Theater on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.  The season series is a good value.
0 ||| Very disappointed. Returned home to 6 damaged items from blatant rough housing and rushing including broken items, gash in wall, two instances of significantly  scraped furniture. Some of which were \"hidden\" strangely, none were reported. Furniture was all crooked, valances left every which way (however vacuum attachment must have left them), shower heads changed and facing OUT of shower (found that out the hard way), lights unplugged, stereo settings changed, child safety outlets removed, two pieces of mysterious broken glass found on floor. I understand that things happen but all together this is a bit much!
0 ||| If I could give zero stars to this place I would!  I will NOT step foot into the LaBella Salon again!  My color was DISASTEROUS!!!  My appointment was with Heather.  OMG!  I sat for over 2 HOURS with color on my hair & when we parted it for a cut, there was a quarter of an inch STILL grey!!!! Ugh!!!  She never offered a smidgen of sympathy!  She immediately applied a darker color & stripped me of all if the blonde I had!  I was in the salon for 4 hours w/out lunch & my head STILL stings!!!  She totally ruined my hair.  The roots still are not covered & when I went elsewhere in tears, she looked carefully at it & found areas that had turned green!  I'm sorry...I don't complain & I always find the best in others.  THIS TIME I CANNOT!  DO NOT GO THERE FOR HAIR!!!!
3 ||| Went here for the first time today with a friend of mine.  We ordered 5 things and shared all of it, including a roll with Kobe beef.\nEverything was really fresh and the flavors were great.\nSat at the sushi bar, the two chefs were busy the entire time we were there and that was on Saturday afternoon from about 1:30-3.  The chefs apologized for the wait, but as long as they acknowledged us, we were fine.  Other service just a little slow, but I'm not really complaining...\nI'll definitely be back, enjoyed the knowledge if the chef and the rolls were great!
0 ||| Last week I was told that my radiator hoses on our 2008 Honda Accord needed to be replaced because they showed a lot of wear, getting soft, could go anytime, especially with Arizona's heat. I called back this past Wednesday to set an appt to flush my coolant and replace the hoses andwas quoted from Dave McCombs, the store manager, that I should replace the thermostat at the same time. Their price for doing these 3 things was well over $500. Being somewhat suspicious of their price and recommendations, I opted to go to Tempe Honda and get second opinion. According to their service writer my radiator hoses were in great shape and typically didn't need replacing for at least 10 years and he could never remember replacing a thermostat on a Honda Accord. Tempe Honda's  price for flushing the coolant was a mere $69.95 and they even washed my car prior to me picking it up. \nI only need to be burned once from an auto repair shop and I'm happy that I got a second honest opinion. As far as I'm concerned, Sun Devil Auto repair in Sun Lakes are rip-offs, trying to take advantage of anyone looking to do business with them.
2 ||| So being from the Chicago-land area I'm quite familar with Aurelios. I actually didn't realize it was a chain. \n\nTo be honest, back home I didn't eat at Aurelios very much. The pizza was always good but it was super expensive. \n\nAnyways, Aurelios is right across the street from me now, so i go there often. If you know what to order its good. The first time I went there we ordered the stuffed pizza. Bad idea. It was seriously undercooked. Like it should have been in the oven for at least 10 more minutes. The crust was soggy. \n\nThe regular crust is a different story. Once I tasted it I was sooo happy. It's been 8 months since I've had decent pizza in this town. Its like Chicago regular crust should be. Quality sauce, good cheese and generous toppings. It's really good. Here's the problem. A large 3 toppings delivered was $29.00. Thats pretty expensive for a pizza. But out here, theres not any good pizza around. (Amore is so far!) so I guess it's worth it. \n\nThe happy hour is decent too. I will be back, but just because there are no other affordable options. I should have gotten more groupons!!!!
4 ||| without a doubt, my favorite place in the world. This is where you will find me during the zombie apocalypse. When you are pulling up you are telling yourself, hell no! But once you walk in side you are saying hell yes! It is the coolest little spot in the worst neighborhood. And when you walk in the cellar downstairs its like you own the place. Feels like walking in the back of a restaurant like the mafia guys in the 50's movies. The best beers in the world and some you have never heard of, and always have great new drafts on tap. Its the only place I have seen Ska Decadent on tap outside of Ska Bewing. May we drink in peace :)
3 ||| Pho best hang over cure ever for vegas but limited on add ins like certain meats. Service is ok, but horrible for large groups. Their alright in my book, because every time my groups order is put in, our soup comes out within 5 mins, so not complaining.
1 ||| Crab was seasoned well with Old Bay.  Moderately overpriced due to the very small portions of sides.
3 ||| I have been using Firestone over the past few years for service and repair. Quality of service typically varies with location. For the past year I have been using the Scottsdale location.  Until the last two visits, I've had good experiences - no pushy sales guys, respectful explanations of service, reasonable repair and service times (I've never made an appointment).  The last two visits however, I've had to return due to them not completing service as requested. The first time, I asked for my wiper blades to be changed, they weren't so I had to take the car back for a second visit. This time, I requested that my battery be replaced because I've been having problems with it. They didn't replace the battery so I had to bring the car back a 2nd time. They are always apologetic about it, which I appreciate, but I'd appreciate it much more if they'd do the job right the first time.
2 ||| Overall: One of Pittsburgh's better pies, but definitely for eating only on premise. Better service than Aiellos, but the pie is heavier, greasy, and not as fresh. Come here on occasion, but Aiellos wins across the board.\n____________________________________________\nAmbience: (3/5). Dim lighting, dingy pizza parlor table-tops, and framed accolades and family photos turn this into a pizza den. Crowded, booth-only dining area save for the stools for the island in the middle. The front counter is the kitchen, so you'll leave smelling like pizza.\n____________________________________________\nService: (3/5). Rushed but pleasant. The 10+ people behind the counter swap in and out, delivering pies and taking orders. It's cafeteria style, vending machine included, and you do have to give them your dirty tray. \n____________________________________________\nDrinks: (1/5). Soda, and nothing special. Ice cream is served next door.\n____________________________________________\nFood: (3/5). An experience in excess, and if you want grease and cheese, this is it. The cheese is thicker than the crust, slides off at least 50% of the time. 2-3 paper plates are soaked at the end of a pepperoni.. spicy and occasionally burnt. Crust is thin and absorbs a large amount of grease. The sauce is occasionally burnt on, otherwise thin, thankfully salty. Pepperoni or mushroom are good bets here, as are onion and sausage. You DO NOT need extra cheese.
2 ||| The serving is good, but the steak dinner is not that good, also the sauce for the fried squid is strange.......
0 ||| I concur with the prior reviewer...this place is horrible to deal with. RUN, DON'T WALK away from this company. They have the most unresponsive customer service program around, they do not deliver what they promise, and they consistently fail to maintain adequate contact with their customers. I have tried to contact management in the past to deal with my complaints, but they shield themselves with rather powerless customers service reps....sending their reps \"into the trenches\" as it were while the middle managers hide from any responsiveness and responsibility. The CSRs (once you can get them) are polite and concerned but clearly without adequate information or authority necessary to resolve a problem. Find another company to get your medical supplies from, this one is owned and run by hucksters and sham artists....that....or incredibly inept business managers! It is apparent that all they care about is the profit with no concern about the consumers they are supposed to serve.
0 ||| Horrible service. They couldnt seat us for 20 minutes even though there are open seats. Waited another 15 for a server. Ill go to tempe next time or just not here
0 ||| I don't get it. Cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza? Why does Pittsburgh have to be so weird? I just got accustomed to fries and coleslaw on my sandwiches but a guy has to draw the line somewhere. And what's with everyone bagging up their extra cheese and taking it home? \n\nMy gut tells me this would be an awesome pizza if only they'd cook it.
1 ||| Macayo's used to be decent but over the years the food has gone downhill. I refuse to eat here and only went because we met friends there. The salsa taste like it comes from a can, the food is far from authentic. If you're in the area, Manuel's is a better alternative. If  you're looking for real mexican food, go to Tony's or Zamora's.
4 ||| Perfect experience for this Steelers fan from Maryland. Had the walk up tour, tour guide knew exactly what she was talking about with a great personality to match. Had a really great time :)
2 ||| Bland taste for what this restaurant's reputation has in the neighborhood.  I was not impressed at all.  I had Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pork Fried Rice and Wonton Soup.  Nothing to write home about.  It didn't WOW me.  The rice was very sticky, the soup was very bland in richness and the Chicken had a Boneless Buffalo Wing texture to it.  \n\nLucky Kitchen down the street is cheaper and is more authentic in taste.
0 ||| The round chocolate cake I ordered for my friend's birthday was one of worst cake I ever had in my life. I was so embarrassed watching my friends struggling to pretend that they liked cake.\n\nThe cake was old, probably the same one I saw when I put in the order the day before. The cake tasted like the sponge I use to wash my dishes, except my sponge is softer. The icing was like pure powder sugar, it was grainy and oily. \n\nLast but not the least, they used this transparent pink color icing to write the name on top of the cake which was so idiotic. The writings blended in the beige color of the cake, and nobody cqn read what it said.\n\nI swear I won't go spend $28 for a terrible embarrassment again.
3 ||| The pros:\n\n- Good service.  The hostess was friendly and seated me promptly.  Though my friend hadn't arrived yet, there was no prob to get a table and wait at the the table.  Throughout dinner our server was courteous and quick.  We also had, who I think is a manager, check on us a couple of times, and made sure we were ok.\n\n- Fresh guac - As Dave S. pointed out (and thank you for the rec on this place!) there's a guy that goes table to table and offers fresh guac.  We sampled a bit and really liked it, so he served us a fresh bowl of it.  It's creamy, fresh, and very good!\n\n- Basket of tortilla chips and salsa - The tortilla chips are right out of the oven, and are warm & crispy to perfection.  They serve them with a small bowl of salsa and a small plate of salad.  It took a lot of self control to not inhale the whole thing!\n\nThe cons:\n\n- Few vegetarian/vegal options - The menu only has about three things to select if you're vegetarian and/or vegan.  Also my cheese enchillada was very bland and was brought out without any sauce on it, which was kind of odd.  I've had cheese enchilladas at so many other Mexican restaurants and they always serve it with salsa verde or standard red salsa, in this case I had to ask for a side bowl of red salsa.\n\n- Mariachi Band - Ok, they're not a total \"negative\" but it was a little distracting having them blast their music at our table right when my friend showed up.  We hadn't seen each other in 2 years and were ready to catch up but all we could do was shout at each other b/c the band chose to perform right at our table.  As soon as we answered their request of what type of song to play, and they played a good chearful piece, and after we tipped them, they left, then we could actually eat and talk without raising our voices.  But the music was good and they were a nice group, so it's not all bad, just not great timing on their part.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI'd probably go back here if I was in the area, but not likely to go out of my way.
4 ||| Went here on a Friday night. Ate at the bar.\nGreat bartender and excellent food. Felt a little rushed but all in all, nice place to eat and good service and more importantly good  quality food.\nI'll be back.
2 ||| Attended the Ancient Ales, Modern Science event with several others and was very disappointed. \nThe Ancient Ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only 1 or 2 of the breweries made it the whole 4 hours. We spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didn't get a chance to see much of the Science Center, thankfully I was with good company.
3 ||| Note to guys everywhere: Olbrich is a great place to take a date!  You get to walk around in semi-secluded areas and look at beautiful things.  It's romantic without even trying.\n\nI love seeing how both the outdoor gardens and indoor conservatory flowers change at different times of the year.  Plus, the conservatory is so nice and warm during the winter!
0 ||| Overpriced. Rude staff. Hit or miss food.\n\nThe roast potatoes, open faced roast beef, and sangria are good. That's about it. I ordered chicken soup and I swear it was out of a Campbell's soup can.  Very overpriced. I see some reviews on here saying, \"you get what you pay for\" and I agree normally,but at this place you WILL overpay. \n\nEVERY time I have been there (at least 6 times) the waitstaff is rude, clueless or both. If you have a cheese plate on the menu, the waitstaff should know something about the cheeses! I have also seen the manager (tattooed guy) be rude to other customers. I cannot recommend.
0 ||| Chinese food...really you've turned your back on me!!!  This restaurant is really nothing special. Nothing to walk all the way down Wood street from Grant street for. \n\nReally,  hardly any care goes into the preparation of their dishes. This is how I'm feeling towards a lot of Chinese food establishments anymore. \n\nIt's greasy , soggy limp veggies served on rock hard dried out rice. The Mandarin Gourmet wow what a laugh, not worth my time , energy or money. Hell I don't even have a better place I could suggest you go to Downtown for Chinese...what a shame. \n\nThere is nothing Mandarin or Gourmet about this restaurant, the name is a total farce.
0 ||| Manager : Lack of management skills and has no understanding about customer services/support. Need to learn how to treat customer with respect.  \n No more shopping at this store.
1 ||| Okay Thai food, nothing special, and overpriced. Ordered the eggplant with shrimp, veggie fried rice, and chicken satay. Eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp. The veggie fried rice and chicken satay were both substandard as far as other Thai food restaurants in the area. It is pricier than most other Thai places in the area and based on the quality, I would not recommend.
2 ||| Actually, more like a 2.5. We left a bit disappointed. We make it a point to hit some Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives when we're on vacation with the kids, and agree with the previous reviewer the Guy missed the mark on this one.\n\nWhile the portions are \"generous\" to say the least, the food was only \"good.\" My husband and I split the Chicken Parm Hoagie...good, not great. The standout of this sandwich was the hoagie roll...it was amazing. To accompany the sandwich I ordered a dinner salad, my husband the wedding soup. Again, good not great. My son ordered the roast beef and au jus sandwich. Like our sandwich it was enormous and served on an awesome roll, but the awesome stopped there. It was really bland, and the au jus, even more so. However our little one ordered buttered noodles and was pleased as punch. For what's worth, the old school, off the beaten path character of the building was kind of charming. But you can't eat that.\n\nIf your goal is a lot of food at a cheap price, this is your stop. If you're looking for an \"off the hook\" dining experience, drive on.
2 ||| We have been coming back to Pong Pong for years; so that is saying something.  I do find that their fried chicken dishes seem to be over fried, but everything else is great.  You do get a hugenamount of food for what you pay.  Do wish they opened a smidge earlier on weekends, but it is what it is.
1 ||| I loved this place because I had amazing health insurance at the time so I happily paid $400 for 2 pairs of glasses which would have cost us $1500 out of pocket. I liked their frame selection because they carry Gucci, Dior, & Oliver People's but they are TERRIBLE at doing lenses. If you have bad eyesight and actually need glasses to do their job, do not come here. \n\nMy husband and I both got the poly-carbonate lenses with anti-glare and I was so disappointed by the quality. I needed my glasses adjusted when I got them (as everybody does) and the crappy lab that these people send their glasses to put on a cheap layer of anti-glare so that when they're adjusted, they literally melt and smear!!! Who does that!? I've been wearing glasses for 10 years now and have never had to deal with something so ridiculous. \n\nAfter my first fitting and my lenses got smeared, they sent them back and received the second pair a week and a half later. Those got smeared during the adjustment process too. Those were sent back and on my 3rd pair, the people realized that they'll have to put a cloth over the lenses to not get them too hot so they won't smear. What a hassel! This place is so far from my house and every time I need adjustments, I have to come back here in hopes that my lenses won't smudge and I'll be screwed out of glasses. I've had those glasses since last February and about 6 months in, the anti-glare began rubbing off at the bottom and continued to do so until my frames snapped two nights ago. \n\nMy husband's anti-glare actually got smudged because he left his glasses out in the car one day and then tried to clean them. This place offers a one year warranty on their lenses so they replaced them for free, but it was still an incredible inconvenience. I will never recommend anybody nor return here again. My father-in-law also purchased a pair of glasses here and had the same problem of the anti-glare wearing after a couple of months. So cheap. Go across the street to Lenscrafters where you pay a little more but you only have to wait one hour instead of 1 month to get a pair of working glasses.
3 ||| It's called \"Babeway\" for a reason people...\n\n\nBut I go here for the Deli, they have the best panini. I like to stop in for the 3 cheese panini with mustard and tomato. It's also a good choice to pair up with the Italian wedding soup.
0 ||| Honestly my faverate pho restaurant is pho so 1, but they closed yesterday .. so I went this restaurant instead. No surprisingly, the servers were not kind for customers as always.  and..I found a fly in my pho and they didn't appolozie for that. this place was horrible... I will never go back!!
3 ||| My husband and I were just married here on Friday, and despite it being a very busy holiday (4th of July), we felt like the staff who helped us were 100% focused on our wedding. They probably had other weddings right before and right after ours, but when they were with us, we were all that mattered.\n\nPastor Al was great. He gathered some information from us to use in the ceremony (where we're from, how we met, etc.), and also managed to pick up on a couple of details about us just from overhearing us talk in the lobby. That was a pleasant surprise. \n\nI could barely remember the ceremony after it was over, thanks to nerves, so the DVD they sent us home with helped us relive the whole thing when we got back. The videographer was pretty good; he caught all the important moments at all the right angles, and he queued our music at exactly the right times for maximum impact (including the Rick Roll of our audience at the end). \n\nThe photographs are stunning. I can totally believe they're rated #1 for photography in the country. Our two photographers were unobtrusive during the ceremony-- I didn't even notice they were there-- and they were very professional while corralling all of our friends and family for group shots afterward. A side note about the price of the photographs: yes they're expensive, but they're also much, much cheaper than you'd pay for professional photography at a traditional wedding. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because, like other commenters noted, the suggested gratuity for the drivers, photographers, and officiants is pretty steep. It should be included in the package price or stated more conspicuously on the chapel website, and the couple should be allowed to decide whether or not they want to tip a little more for above-and-beyond service.
4 ||| I love this place!  Great for kids because they have activities for them and in the spring the butterfly garden is teeming with life.  Always have a something great on exhibit.  Being a member there myself, I know there are a lot, no, a ton of classes and walks and guides there almost daily.  Classes from the arts to landscape design.  \n\nThe experience is never the same there on the trails and in the exhibits, which is what makes it so fun.  You really have to go there and walk the trails and hear the jazz played at night!
3 ||| I understand Primanti is a historic institution here in Pittsburgh but other than the name I don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. I got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when I moved here. Really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. I went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw, tomato, french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as I finished the second half. The sheer size of it all was just too much too. I wouldn't return again, though if you're visiting and into doing Pittsburgh touristy stuff I would say you would need to experience Primanti to judge for yourself.
0 ||| I went in with my mother and a close friend to top off what was a fantastic girls day. It started off a little rocky with one of the pedicure chairs being broken. That wasn't too much of a problem, they switched me to another chair when it came available. After waiting quite some time to get my nails done, I was very happy with the outcome. And the wait was not a problem because we were in high spirits and they were under staffed (not their fault). The problem comes with how they handled business when my friend was unhappy with her nails. She got the gel colors ($20 extra to her mani/pedi) and when they were finished, the color was faded in some areas, and didn't even cover her entire nail. She wanted to just alert the nail technician that she was unhappy, and that she didn't have time to get them redone because they take to long and it was time to pick up her son from daycare. The lady became extremely rude and insulted. She then agreed to give my friend $10 off since she was unhappy, then 2 minutes later changed her mind for no reason at all. They were finally talked down a little bit, but it was such a hassle and they assured her that her nails were NOT messed up. My friend gets her nails done all the time and they never look like that. I have enjoyed this place for years and this experience, and the way my friend was treated puts a bad taste in my mouth. I may come back but it is highly unlikely and I will NEVER be helped by the technician my friend had. The gentleman and the young girl with the really long hair were great. The older woman has no sense of customer service.
0 ||| I understand the hassles.\n\nIts annoying when all you want is a $10 car wash and every time they want to charge you for any number of sealants and crap.  And \"no thank you\" isn't good enough.  They have to give you their situational anecdotes and keep hassling.  Go to Danny's, they understand that no means no.
4 ||| My entire family have trusted our pets for 2 generations of doctors! Dr Bramley Sr and now Dr Bramley Jr! Wow they are a great family. I understand the grandfather was a vet as well. They tell it like it is and don't try to upsell you on anything. They are in it for the pets well-being as well as you. Very caring family I highly recommend. Just a word of advise due to the long lines in the morning I try to go in the afternoon! Great Job EAH!!!
4 ||| Anytime I house sit for my parents, I hit this place at least 3 times that week.  They dont mess around, some of the better steak and salsa/chips, good rice, beans.  I just get it all in the burrito with cheese sc and guacamole, MMM MM MMMM, good stuff.  Never feel like I paid too much, sometimes I feel like I paid too little.  Theres only one guy that works there that I've ever had a problem with and Im sure the owner took care of him for me once he saw how often I come.
4 ||| I most certainly agree with Faith D on this one...this Pier 1 is filled to the gills with a myriad of home goods. It's especially great for entertaining platters, decor and holiday items. And, if you're lucky, you may be able to score a sweet hurricane or table runner in the large clearance section. \n\nIn general, you'll have to do some serious digging. While the employees are very chipper and helpful with suggestions and such, this store is crammed with items. So much so that it may make one feel a bit claustrophobic. Regardless, there are goodies to be had and deals to be found. If you're seeking items for your home or a housewarming gift, check out Pier 1.
4 ||| The staff at this hotel are all so attentive and efficient. \nLook you guys.... I'm accustomed to to rouging it since I'm on the road so much and this is Not that.\nFrom the accommodating Front Desk Staff, to housekeeping, to the valets and belhops. Just a really good experience overall.\n\nWe had one seriously minor hiccup, but the front desk staff was gracious and appropriately apologetic. They got the issue taken care of quickly & we didn't have any other problems.\n\nParking downtown is expensive. I took advantage of the Lynx Blue Line Park & Ride to  pinch some pennies and it worked out. Parked 2 days for the cost of the train ride. Win.
0 ||| Conference Center was very good.  Rooms however are old and dirty: carpets are stained, Tube TVs are old and remotes are missing the numbers on them. I was there for a conference and paid $150/night in the winter so we could not use the pools even if we had time.  The grounds are beautiful but get ready to WALK. Over 200 acres that the hotel sits on, multiple buildings, multiple pools, no drink machines they want you to buy from the minibar, no free wi-fi in the rooms ($15/day), all areas are semi-dark near the rooms and the bellmen drive you around on golf carts.  The People were wonderful!! Very helpful, Very Nice and accommodating!!
2 ||| As long as I lived here, I've never been here. As many times I've driven past. Even when I first moved here. Because...the name of a strip club...Play it Again Sam....Yea....Not really rolling off your tongue type of name. But they have food....Mmmmm Would you eat Fried Pickles at a strip club? Yea....who's pickles?\nWhat made me stop in was the amount of cars in the parking lot. Ok so locals are free. That's a plus...Drinks are cheap. Another Plus....I had Belvedere rocks for 6 somethin? That's not bad.\nThere is gaming. However, service kinda sucked. I spent about sixty bucks in the video poker and 1 comped drink because the bartender is SSsssllooowww. What is he looking at too much ass? Because there's not a lot in there. Ok so I liked 4 of the girls there. Well plus the nerdy goth waitress....hehehe whatever...she wants some big Myke. Mwahaha....But no I didn't give it up. It's actually a cool locals joint - mostly people were there drinking and eating, chillin and talking. Not a bad place. I had to knock it for service and quality of girls. But then again. I don't think it's that kind of club. \nThere are some perks. I mean it's not completely dark. Which is good - so the lapdances you're getting you can at least tell if it's Chewbacca or a random MAN. At least when you're getting a dance you're not like \"oh your boobs on my face feel nice\" er...\"no that's my elbow you're feeling\" \nAwkward....\nHmmm. \nDefinitely an experience to check it out.
4 ||| I am a sucker for themed restaurants and fell in love with Alice Coopers organized chaos.  You first walk through a gated, sports themed, outdoor dining area.  It has a bunch of picnic tables, a concession stand, basketball hoop and flags blowing overhead...very cool! \n\nAs you enter, you are greeted by a face painted Alice Cooper hostess, then realized that all of their employees have their face painted like Alice Cooper! The restaurant itself is engulfed in paraphernalia.  A little chaotic but I wouldn't expect anything less.  It is definitely more a bar than restaurant and the food proved the same. \n\nFirst time dining at Alice Cooperstown, we had to try the \"Big Unit\"! When ordering this monster, you must be prepared for a loud delivery! They ring the bell and yell \"biiig uniiit\" when delivering it to your table! Awesome! There are two options when ordering the big unit.  The original is simple and served without fries.  The second is an \"Adam Richmond\" inspired creation, drenched in toppings and paired with fries, so we got the Adam!  \n\nWhoa Baby! This thing was 2 feet long! \n...did my fiance and I finish it all? Almost! We left about half a foot and called it quits.  We did eat all of the fries.  The fries were good but the dog wasn't anything special.  You mainly order the \"Big Unit\" if you have a big appetite or are looking for an entertaining experience.\n\nThe overall menu is filled with movie and sports inspired entrees.  Mostly fried items with a few pasts dishes.  They have a weekly happy hour with standard offerings on specific days, so you can plan accordingly! Large flat screens cover the entire bar so that, no matter where you are seated, you'll have a comfortable view!
0 ||| We heard great things about this restaurant (elsewhere than yelp) so we decided to check it out.  We should have turned the other way when we saw the filthy walls behind the BBQ butcher area but the menu sounded good and figured the portions would be huge.  We were sat and ordered the BBQ duck/pork combination and a plate of sweet and sour chicken. The food came out almost too soon and in super tiny portions (I'm suspicious they gave us the leftovers of someone else's order). The pork was dry and no better than the usual stuff you get on the side at every chinese restaurant. The duck was the most depressing part of the meal: almost all bone and skin on a tiny plate. The chicken wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. All of it was mediocre at best. My boyfriend ate most of it because he was starving but I just nibbled at the food. We will not be coming back here.\n\nAfter being totally disappointed and wanting to get out of there as quickly as possible we looked at the bill and they had charged us for the rice that came with our meal without even asking us if we wanted it. What chinese restaurant charges you for rice with sweet and sour chicken? They took it off the bill, literally pulled the rice off our table and brought it back to the kitchen (probably to serve to another guest). \n\nOur bill was $28 and the food was just enough to feed one person. My boyfriend is already getting hungry again and it's been about an hour since we left. My boyfriend suspects racial bias was the culprit here. \nThe plates being served to all the asian guests looked better and bigger than ours did. I think we got the worst part of the duck as well.\n\nAll in all I wish we would have gone to Ichiza down the street. :-/
4 ||| As I look at all the reviews, it seems like this place is a hit or miss. I have been going to this place for so many years, never had a problem. I will say my absolute favorite thing to get is the steamed pork bbq bun, and i normally get it when its made fresh anytime before 11am. Had the trio bun also, which was good. Just a great selection of pastries and bread overall. Can't go wrong!
2 ||| We were traveling (from California) and my wife needed treatment for an ear infection that had started before the trip.  We found Advanced Urgent Care through the web and elected to go to one (they have 8 in the Phoenix area) closest to our hotel.  We even called ahead for an appointment and showed up on time.  I guess it's good we had the appointment - that kept the waiting time down to only about two hours (!!).  My wife was then seen by a physician's assistant who actually had a specialty in ear, nose and throat, and seemed to know what she was doing in diagnosing the problem, giving advice and providing a prescription that we could be filled nearby.  The ear infection eased up after treatment, so I'd say the treatment was OK.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some troubling things about this place, beyond the long wait even with an appointment.  Like the first thing you see walking in the door - a junk food vending machine selling chips, candy and the like.  Almost right next to the registration desk.  Now maybe Arizona is not as enthusiastic about healthy eating and preventive care as some parts of California - I can accept that because we Californians can be a bit obsessive at times.  But for a doctor's office to be pushing junk food as soon as the patient enters the building (and I'm sure the corporate owner of Advanced Urgent Care gets a cut of the vending machine sales) is just barely better than having a cigarette vending machine in the corner.  It's putting profits before public health and that's never a good thing.\n\nThe other thing I found troubling was the TV in the waiting room - set for a religious channel - not exactly welcoming to people with different religious beliefs.  Surely they could be playing videos on healthy eating or something like that.  But then, I suppose, they'd have to remove the junk food vending machine for lack of use, and that would be bad for the bottom line.\n\nSo, to conclude, the treatment for my wife's fairly straightforward problem was competent, but I'm not sure this chain of urgent care centers really has taken a mission of public health to heart.
4 ||| This is one of my favorite local restaurants and I always enjoy the food and service.  Their menu is terrific and has a number of great options although I find myself often ordering the Griddled Corn cakes (with bacon) for brunch or the 16th St beef short rib.    \n\nWhile I have never used them it appears they have some private space for larger group gatherings and the bar area is great and has a few TV's.  \n\nThe service is always adequate to great and it is nice to have a restaurant that tends to have a relaxed atmosphere and is generally on the quieter side.  This is generally one of the restaurants I will take friends and family to when they are visiting as it tends to please a broad range of personalities and palettes.
3 ||| This is the only place I take my vehicles to get inspected.  \n\nThis is all they do- inspections. They do not do oil, do not change tires, they do not try to sell you a car.....they just do inspections.\n\nNormally it does not take more than 15 minutes or so to do an inspection here, as they do have three bays open, and the staff is friendly.\n\nThe waiting room is small, a small tv in the corner, and lots of magazines, to choose from.  Since it is only a few minutes for the inspection.....it is hard to complain about the chairs, or the limited tv channels, and most people tend to sit outside while they wait.\n\nI am glad they only do inspections, it just makes it easy to have the same place do it year after year, without the hassle of someone trying to sell you things you do not need.\n\nNCFoodGuy
4 ||| Great place to take the family.  Would recommend this location for parties. Glen, the game attendant did a great job resolving the problem with one of the games.
2 ||| I drive past this place everyday on the way to school. My husband and I had a craving for some (a lot of) Chinese food so I decided we should check this place out. First off let me warn you, it's pretty scary looking on the outside, and where I sat on the inside too. But the food was enjoyable, especially for the price. All of my dishes were hot, except one but it didn't bother me too much. The Chinese fries were to die for, and everything else was just what I wanted greasy delicious I ate so much I have to unbutton my pants buffet food. Not four stars, definitely bit five stars, but a solid I would come here again 3 stars.
0 ||| If you go here to have a mole taken off, DO NOT let one of the PA's do it (physician assistant).  He butchered me a year ago.  I have never been on Yelp but felt the need to get on here to give this place a rating to warn others.  The PA \"Mike\", tall black guy with dreads, and very lackadazical attitude, was absolutely horrible.  Very poor in communication.  Told me he was going to do one thing, but did another while under the knife.  I have 3 very horrible scars, and a 1\" patch of hair missing from a very small bump taken off my scalp.  He said it would just be a 3 or 4 mm diameter circle punch and one or two stiches, but under the knife he gave me just over an inch long cut with 8 stiches.  He failed to tell me the under skin stitches may try to push out of skin, which they did, caused scar tissue and permanent hair loss.  6 months later i went back to complain, and the Doctor there fixed it the best he could, for free, which is why I'm giving this place at least 2 stars.  Theres still noticable hair loss.  I'm always having to explain the HORRIBLE 2\" scar i have on my shoulder, which should not be there for a simple mole removal.  I'm always told I'm a good looking guy and now i have these scars.  I chose this place because they could get me in quick, within a week or so (before my insurance changed), as opposed to a reputable doctor with a waiting list of 4 months or so.  Big mistake I will always regret.  Also, the secretaries are very sub par, lazy, and the phone system sucks.  If you're on your way and can find the place, or if you need to let them know you're running late, YOU CAN'T GET THRU and theres no clear way to get in touch with someone thru the phone system.  It leads you to the wrong departments and doctor.  They also accidentally billed me twice.  If I wasn't on top of things I would have paid the $400 bill which insurance had already covered.
1 ||| I love Dairy Queen. Growing up in Michigan, their treats could only be enjoyed in the summer months. I was certain I would gain twenty pounds when I moved into Plaza Midwood and this location was a short two block walk from my house. \n\nI had no need to worry though because this DQ is consistently subpar. It's not the lack of seating. It's not the long lines. The problem is that the ice cream is soupy. It's almost as if they melt the ice cream prior to creating blizzards. \n\nBlizzards are supposed to be served upside down to show off their thickness. If a blizzard from this DQ was served upside down, you'd have to change your shoes after it splattered out of the cup. \n\nThis is a consistent problem in fall and summer. The owners need to fix their machines because they have lost a customer!
0 ||| Hillstone where did it all go wrong?  Just had lunch and from the parking, the unfinished patio where I can only order apps and what can only be described as the worst sushi second only to the bulk garbage at the supermarket..the experience is a total let down..some one told me the name is a result of the fact if you have more that 20 restaurants with the same name you have to add calorie info. Houston's has 20+  so why not just change 1 or 2 to the awesome, roll off the tongue Hillstone. .Back to the sushi...enough with the sesame seeds ok I want to taste the fish! The rolls were down right gross..and the price...really I don't think so..Stick with the burgers, steak and side and I sure you will be satisfied..\nps..Your sushi stinks get rid of it
0 ||| Wow!  I am so unhappy about Buono's. We came here several times a month for the past 15 years (we live quite far away) and loved the pizza and sandwiches. It was not fancy, but the pizza was excellent and true  New York style. Nowhere else in the valley could I get pizza the way I knew that it should be made.\n\nI read that Buono's was sold recently and visited twice before reading about the sale. The restaurant had been spruced up, the staff was different and the food terrible. We had a disgusting Chicken Parmigiana hero. Awful. The next visit we decided to stick to the plain cheese pizza. I had previously said that if I could have one last meal before going on the electric chair it would be Buono's Pizza. I would now rather throw this pizza onto the electric chair! It is AWFUL!!! Thick bready crust covered in too much cheap cheese with terrible sauce. We didn't even finish our slices. The tasteless garlic knots were brought out still frozen in the middle. Yuck!  I will never go back again. So terrible. If anyone knows Jimmy and finds out if he reopens somewhere, please post here. Stay away!!! If I could give no stars, I would, but just because it was epic and is now so mediocre.
2 ||| It is a coffee shop. also sells yogurt. WiFi did not work. If you need your fix it is better than nothing
2 ||| NOTE : they have just been shut down / closed / seized by the County Sherriffs office for non-payment of the drink tax .   RIP, PGH Cafe.
0 ||| Bad food and slow service. Chili was Luke warm. Burgers were raw in middle.
3 ||| Ok, I'm from the south so I know a good flea market when I see one.  Also a point I'd like to make is that the new age of flea markets has left a bitter taste in my mouth in regards to the material offered up to passers by.  I get tired of the cell phone case, bootleg DVD and off brand shoe spots.\n\nThis flea market has a bit of that but just enough of the random too to make me happy and want to visit again.  Cool food court is a bonus and the restrooms were what I would call acceptable.  \n\nBottom line, if you want to blow a few hours, come check this place out.  Remember, cash only sales!
1 ||| Im the kind of guy that balance experiences using different factors that come as a whole at the end. If the food is good but service mediocre, or if the service is great but food alright, etc . I believe there is just a few perfect places and its unfair to . But when all (or most) factors are just bad..it leaves me a very sour taste.\n\nThe food was good. Ill give them that..Average AYCE flavor. Rolls had a little too much rice but tasted pretty good and the selection was pretty big. The menu carries a lot of different roll styles and plenty of appetizers . The fish on the nigiri is not cut very thin so you get a good taste of it and they do put a little wasabi between the fish\nand rice that gives a little kick as well.\n\nThe chef and the whole staff in general were very cold and simply not caring to an extent that we felt like they were doing us a favor for letting us eat there. It all started when we asked for a miso soup and never got it and the chef questioned us like we were lying.Then,I had to order my drink 3 times, and did not get one refill on it for the\nwhole 45 minutes they allow you to be there. Which brings me to the next point : At the 42 minutes mark our server came and dropped the check and said your time is up. I was a server so for me this  was a pretty rude approach but let me explain you why I got annoyed .\n\nWhile ordering our nigiri and rolls. The chef was constantly forgetting to make the items and decided to just watch some good ol' TV. I tried using my telekinetic powers to call his attention but ended up having to use the classic \"excuse me\" around 8 times . Then when I recited the forgotten order to him, he then proceeded to make\nit wrong (cucumber on no cucumber, 1 order instead of 2, etc). At one point he decided to stop making our order and went to the back for about 10 minutes. At a place where there are clocking your time like Nazis, 10 minutes is a lot, add to those the times he was profoundly concentrated on his jerry springer episode while ignoring us. So out of the 45 minutes , we might have had a chef for around 25.\nIt saddens me specially  when it's the service part that kills the experience which happens to be the part that you can fully control as a business. And what saddens me the most is that I cant make a funny review this time.\n\nYou might be thinking..oh there was a language or cultural barrier, but no. Ive been to places where I cant even communicate with my server but had a much more pleasant experience. Japanese, Indian, etc you name it .Its all about attitude and body language . Im sad to report I wont be coming to this joint again.
0 ||| I really need a new Wal Mart.  I've been standing in the customer service line for 20 minutes behind the same people just to exchange cans of soup.
1 ||| I received thorough a consultation on the available options for my melasma.  I am so happy to have found a decent dermatologist office after a horrendous experience elsewhere .  I went from a wicked witch and her ugly henchman to a bit more pleasant office setting. Yay!  One thing that I was turned off by is when they do the chemical peel, they don't bother putting on sunscreen.  They just send you on your way?!!  The last visit the tech asked if I brought sunscreen and of course I did since they cant seem to do so.  I haven't experienced that anywhere else.  And find it unprofessional to peel of your skin and then send you on your way into the hot burning sun.
4 ||| Excellent food, excellent price. Especially for lunch!
2 ||| While the smoothies are good (especially the banana) their food and service is less than desirable. I have tried to like this place and give it multiple chances, yet every time I left wishing I went somewhere else. Every time (no joke) they have messed up my order. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. Sorry.
4 ||| If you visit this little designer boutique outside of uptown you will probably walk out happy. Although small, they've got some pretty great items and are running sales often. I wasn't crazy about their jewelry selection - what they had was nice, it was just too small for me. The girls there seem to genuinely want to help you find the perfect piece of clothing, not just push a sale on you, which was refreshing. I'd check this place out if you're in the area.
2 ||| This was my first time getting my nails done at the mall & I only went here because my cousin & I were rushing to get our nails done before I went out that night & the nail salon by my house was busy with 10 ladies already waiting. As soon as we stepped in, we were looking to see if they do acrylic/gel glitter nail designs but all they do there are white tips & airbrush. Since we were in a rush & on a budget, service wasn't at all bad but we wished they'd offer more.
1 ||| No matter when I'm there there is always a long line to checkout.\nAnd the self-checkout works so very poorly (no wonder the ammo is locked up.) (Frustrated, but kidding)\nThe shelves need to be restocked much more often so I can actually buy what I want.\nThe Wally brand \"Great Value\" brand thick-cut bacon is not thick enough, it is more what I consider regular cut, needs to be thicker.\nPharmacy, you guys do an excellent job, keep up the good work.
0 ||| Absolute worst Mexican food I have ever eaten, period. \n\nIt's like Mexican food for people who don't like Mexican food. Much of the food had little taste to it. I would rather eat Taco Bell, and I don't like Taco Bell.
2 ||| I had the Margarita pizza, chopped chicken salad, and the crab & shrimp appetizer. I wish the appetizer would have come before our meal. The service was fine. The manager came to see how everything was, we told him great, except for the Trance Music which was playing too  loud in the background. That was irritating, not relaxing.
1 ||| I went to Burlington to look for school uniforms for my 3 grandchildren, well couldn't find anything so I asked the cashier what time they closed so i could go into az mills mall to look at other stores and she said at 9:30 p.m well it was a Sunday and I found out they closed at 6:30, that wrong info got us locked out  the store from Az mills mall entrance and I had parked in front of burlington coat factory parking lot, wow I was upset because me and my 4 grandchildren had to walk around the mall to get to our car, and that could of been avoided if that cashier from Burlington would have gave me the correct info.
4 ||| This place has some of the best pizza in the Pittsburgh area. I love the lunch specials.
2 ||| And here I thought that this Hilton was moving up on the rating scale as some of the things on my last visit were fixed:\n\n-New lighting in the bathrooms\n-Crabtree and Evelyn bath products (love the way they smell)\n-Quick efficient check in.\n-MP3 plug in \n\nBut that thought quickly faded when:\n\n-My wake up call didn't come (should have used my cell phone-drats!)\n-And there was a spider (A BIG ONE!)  in my room.\n\nOh well. A-OK is just that.
0 ||| I have been going crazy on trying all the well rated thai restaurants around the valley.  Thai food is my new favorite.\n\nI was really excited to try this place with my husband on Saturday.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to eat outside on such a beautiful day.\n\nI was grossed out a bit on how dirty it was (the grime on the plastic curtains around the porch), the dust on the fans, ect.  I do realize I was eating outside in the desert though so I tried to let it go.\n\nThe service was pretty bad.  We had to ask for ice tea refills.  We had to ask for additional sweetner packets.  We were told they didn't have rice to serve our meal with so we would get rice noodles.  This was told to us in a very straight forward mannner with no apologetic tone at all.  No rice at a thai restaurant?!?!  How do you run out of something so basic???\n\nAnyway, the must have remedied the situation because we did indeed get rice with our meals.  My husband ordered the wild boar.  He thought it was just okay.  I had the eggplant and tofu.  I asked them to add some thai pumpkin to it.  It was SUPER YUMMY.  The bill was a bit expensive and I won't be running back.  \n\nIt took us over an hour to get our lunch!!  We didn't stay once we were done eating and spent almost 2 1/2 hours at the restaurant!!\n\nTruth be told I think Thai Elephant or Papaya Thai are still my favorite thai restaurant.
4 ||| Best Cajun food around, no wonder it was completely packed in there!
4 ||| Best tortillas in Arizona, not just Phoenix!!! Large, Fresh and sooo tasty. Reminds me of how my best friends' nana used to make. The beans are very tasty and love all the different burrito variations. You can't go wrong here.
4 ||| The guy behind the counter couldn't have been any nicer when i ordered 10 tons of rock to be delivered. I received a phone call around the time he said I should expect it. The driver called me prior to delivery, he dumped it where I asked him, and it was on time. Prices seemed to be fair and in-line.
4 ||| I love going to Santisis! First of all, it is in a very convenient location for me. The plaza it is in is kind of a dump, but it is close to my house and right off the freeway. Second, they have pretty good happy hour specials on drinks. They have huge beers at good prices...and they serve them in frost mugs! Last, there food is really good too. I love their pizza, wings, and salads. I have heard good things about their pasta too. They have lots of TVs to watch sports on but if you plan on going on Football Sunday, get there early or you won't get a spot!
2 ||| The last time I flew through PHX was the day that America West was doing their Y2K compatibility testing of their flight sensitive systems back in 1999. I remember it like it was yesterday. I sat at PHX for over 8 hours while I waited for my flight to ABQ, and then drove close to 3 hours to Gallup, New Mexico. Imagine my frustration when I realized, had I consulted a map, I could have driven to Gallup in much less time, thereby avoiding several hours of airport appreciation. PHX, I've purposely avoided you for 15 years because of this, but today was a day to let bygones be bygones.\n\nI needed to get somewhere, and the connection that made the most sense was through Phoenix. I flew in and had about an hour to walk around while I waited on my next flight, and made peace with the airport. \n\nFirst, it's been remodeled. Yeah, I know what your thinking, and you're right. It has been 15 years since I was here last and I would hope they would have done something since then. They have, and I was pleased. I also liked the carpet.. If you look close enough, there are little airplanes in the design. Subtle, but if you stare at the floor when your walking like I do, you'll notice it. \n\nI didn't see a Starbucks, which I desperately needed after catching a 6am flight from the eastern time zone, so I settled for a diet coke and found a comfortable seat to watch CNN from while I waited on my flight. Most of the restaurants I came across seemed to be local or regional places; I didn't recognize too many of the names, and they all seemed to have something to do with Mexican food. I really could have used a Starbucks. \n\nAmerica West no longer exists, we aren't preparing for certain doom like we were in 1999 before the new millennium, and I didn't check any bags. All three of these contributed to my positive experience in Phoenix. PHX airport, I'm pleased we had another encounter. All is forgiven. Now, if only it were that easy to forgive Ex's...
4 ||| Why is it that when i arrive here my eyes become far more bigger than my stomach?\n\nAwesome pot-stickers and lettuce wraps.\n\nReally good service, very friendly and most accommodating.\n\nComfortable atmosphere.\n\nKind of a cluster in getting your own drink and makes me wonder if i still have to tip or not.
0 ||| I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon's No 1 B-B-Q.  Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\n\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \"sugar-fried\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\n\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\n\nOh well...
0 ||| Screaming kids and frozen seafood. That is about all this place had to offer. After years of not going to Red Lobster, I decided to try it again for their \"crabfest\" special. Unfortunately, I was reminded of why I quit going here. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a large party with mainly young kids that were screaming and being abnoxious. UNCLE RANDY!!!! God you would think they hadn't seen their uncle, well, ever! Anyways, we were finally seated, unfortunately, not nearly far enough away from the hoards of screaming kids and babies. My husband and I do not have kids nor do we want them. We love to be able to go out to dinner but its gotten to the point where most restaurants are \"family friendly\" which usually entails jerk kids and parents that have learned to tune them out. Quite irritating and inconsiderate actually. \nIn any event, I opted for the crab trio which came with king crab legs, snow crab legs, and crab stuffed shrimp. I ordered the creamy lobster mashed potatoes and a cup of the clam chowder. The hub ordered the shrimp trio which came with two types of shrimp (can't remember what they were but when i asked the hub, he stated \"sh*t, mostly just sh*t.\") and schrimp pasta. He officially hates Red Lobster if you couldnt tell. Both him and I agreed that most of our food tasted as if it was frozen and from a bag. The clam chowder tasted canned. The cheesy sauce on my potatoes along with my shrimp tasted fowl and almost had a chemical taste to it. And most importantly, the biscuits which we had looked forward so much to were overcooked and dry. These used to be the best part of the meal but they have really gone downhill. Actually the restaurant in general has gone downhill. \nThe service was ok but I have one complaint. Although they give you crab crackers, they don't give you the other little gadget that you use to tear the crab so its easier to open. This would have helped alot when I was eating my king crab legs considering that they are thorny and sharp. Not worth cutting up my petite cute little hands to get a little bit of crab meat. Haha.\nTo wrap it up, we will never go back unless we have company and they want to go there. Then I guess we would have to find something to choke down. It sucks because we used to love Red Lobster when they first came out but the quality of, well, everything has gone down throughout the years. The price however, I am fairly certain has gone up. If I am going to pay nearly $40 for a meal, I expect it to be fresh and magnificent, and I expect to not see a misbehaved child in sight. I am not normally a fan of more upscale restaurants but I think i might be giving more of those types of places a try after eating at Red Lobster.
4 ||| I took my wedding ring in to have the diamond reinforced in the setting. I really thought one of the prongs looked thin. To my total surprise and delight they told me the work did not need to be done!  There was no charge for the jeweler looking at my ring and I was told to bring it back next year and they would check it again! Amazing service! The staff was friendly and so helpful. I would go back for any jewelry needs.
4 ||| I don't understand there low ratings this hotel has recurved.  First of all its LA Quinta so it cannot compare to a five star hotel.  For this level hotel it is great!  They allowed me to check in 4 hours early.  Pet friendly with no extra pet fees!!!  The young lady at the front desk was very friendly and efficient.  The facilities are good.  Breakfast is standard.  I would definitely stay again.

0 ||| Got my car washed and I got home I noticed they missed a lot of stuff.called the next day they told me bring my car on and they would wipe everything down..when I got there and showed them what they missed they No it wasn't them that I dirtied my car and it was my fault. Everything was on the passenger side and on the trunk.i explained to them there was no way I got one side that dirty with out getting the tires and driver side dirty. Some big guy came out and told me if I wanted my car 100% clean and spotless it would be 150$ for full detail work. When I tried explaining it to him he told me it wasn't his problem and he didn't care,also told me to wash my car myself if I wanted clean my way.. I told him I'm going to another car wash he said ok good idea I don't need your business and to get off his property.when i got in my car to leave he tried blocking me in claiming cars to pull up behind me and on the side.. Never have I had such horrible service I'm my life.. Needless to say I went to another car wash told the guy I just need out side when he asked me why it looks like it just got washed I took him to the passenger side showed and told him what happend,out of good faith he gave 50% off full service.
0 ||| Wlaked into this place and the guy comes out right away, and asks what I need. I tell him, and right about then his cellphone rings. He spends the next 5 minutes on a personal call, without acknowledging me once (\"be right with you\", \"sorry about this\", etc). All I did was walk into his store and try to do business with him, so I can certainly see how a personal call should take precedence. This place must have all the work they can handle-- try someplace where they value your business.
4 ||| Came here to get an oil change and had no problems. They were friendly, fast, and the manager even gave me a discount. Will be back--
0 ||| We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us \"good luck\". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables. \n\nThe front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back.
3 ||| Rito's! U guys rock! U like Mexican food? Then this is the authentic place in Phoenix that you will come back to over and over again. Now if they just had a shaded seating area with misters it would be a 5 star rating in my book.
2 ||| Updated 3/12/2014. Both the assistant manager on duty the night of our dining and the managing director, Kevin Hommert, called to discuss the disappointing service. Kevin was very open and non-defensive. He's made a few changes already to the table cleaning process and seemed very committed to improving the service level through better staff training.  I wasn't asked to change my review, but I moved it up from 2 to 3 stars to reflect the outreach and positive attitude.\n\n\nOK Food -  Combined with the Staff Training of an Average Fast Food Restaurant .\n\nOften, I think the host position in restaurants sets the stage for the entire meal. How many times have you walked into a restaurant, only to find the hostess staring at the seating map? Hello? Hum, maybe I'll check my phone for messages..... 'Oh Hi!'\nThat's how our dining experience started at Outback. It's not a big deal, but if I ran a restaurant, I'd have a greeter and someone working the table map. It's an easy way to differentiate your restaurant in a crowded market. \n\nAnyway, we were asked to wait a couple minutes while they bussed a table. \n\nWell a couple minutes turned into 10 or more minutes, so I got to watch the table busing process at work. At this Outback, table busing is done by the assistant hostesses. Behind the hostess stand, there's a napkin on the floor with a bucket of disinfectant solution. Once the assistant host is done busing the table they drop the cleaning rag near the bucket, grab menus and seat the party.  Sometimes the rag  lands on the edge of the napkin, sometimes partly on the floor. Doesn't seem to bother anyone doing it, but I doubt it would meet with the approval of a health inspector. It certainly can't impress any customers who notice.\n\nAnyway, back to our wait. Several new parties walk in and are seated, so I approach the hostess and ask if she's forgotten about us. She looks confused and surprised. It's obvious she has - and we were quickly seated on the other side of the restaurant. Our table hadn't been cleaned properly, so my wife had to wait another 7-8 minutes or so until our waitress arrived, as she had been getting drinks for a large party. We asked to have the table cleaned. She immediately asked the hostess stand to send someone over. They grab the rag off the floor and head over --somewhere else in a big hurry. Meanwhile she takes our drink order and food order - still no table cleaning. We ask again. She asks again. An assistant host heads over with the rag from the floor. I ask for a clean rag, not one off the floor - or  'off the napkin on the floor' -  as they put it, and eventually we have a clean table - well at least it's not sticky any more.\n\nFood was OK. Waitress did a great job trying to make things right. The hostess came over at the end of the meal to apologize for the rocky start, and offer desert. I told her that was very nice. I don't think I've ever had a hostess come over and apologize, so I thanked her. She offered desert again. We declined again. (We can't have it for health reasons.)  Nice service recovery until she got up to leave. As she walks away, she has the oddest expression. I think it was something between wanting to roll her eyes, (but she didn't) to being frustrated by us not accepting the 'peace offering', to confusion as how someone could possibly turn down desert.  \n\nI wish restaurants moved beyond 'free desert' as the solution to all problems. Not everyone is looking for a freebie. Most people just want great food, and good service from a well trained staff. Where was the manager in all this? I don't know. I didn't ask to speak with one, but a good one would have come over early in the dinner. I don't know, maybe the hostess was the manager, but she seemed a bit young and running the host stand certainly doesn't leave time to make sure things are running smoothly.\n\nI sent Outback a similar review, but they haven't acknowledged it or responded to me, which tells me the lack of customer engagement is probably systemic. Outback is part of the Blooming Brands chain of restaurants. Other brands include Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Flemings and Roy's. Flemings has good food and excellent service. But, I guess I just don't get the Outback, Carrabba, Bonefish Grill model of moderately expensive food paired with mediocre, inexperienced service. \n\nIf you're going to drop $100 on a steak dinner do yourselves a favor and avoid chain restaurants, especially those with inconsistent management.  Food was OK, but with the exception of the nice waitress, the staff was about as well trained as your average fast food restaurant. Not a good situation when your bill comes in near $100. Find a good independent steak house and pay the extra bucks. It'll be worth it.
4 ||| Red Lobster can sometimes get a bad rap, but I had a blast there this past Friday night. We got there around 6:30pm and the line was out the door. No biggie as we had nothing else to do and we wanted the endless shrimp. Plus my friend had never been to a Red Lobster and it has been about 2 years since my last visit. So after waiting only about 30 mins we got seated and were on our way to pigging out. \n\nFirst off, let me give a special shout out to our waitress Carina! She was very sweet and took great care of us. Thank you Carina! \n\nSo we both knew that we wanted the endless shrimp meal but being the hungry people that we are, we also ordered the appetizer that had stuffed mushrooms, fried clams, and bacon wrapped scallops. YUM! Everything came out piping hot and was very good. I mean bacon wrapped scallops. HELLO! Best of both worlds. The cheddar baked biscuits were still as good as I remembered and fresh out the oven. My friend loved them and was very excited that they brought out more once we had downed the first batch. Oh I also have to give a special mention to the Triple Berry Sangria that they now offer. WOW! Now that is some yummy sangria. Almost as good as mine (LOL) but seriously very good. \n\nNow on to the endless shrimp, we each got to start off with two choices so I chose the teriyaki shrimp and the cajun shrimp and my friend had the garlic shrimp and the coconut shrimp bites. They both come with your standard salad and side of french fries, mashed potato, baked potato, rice or veggies. My friend bumped it up and ordered the lobster baked potato. Needless to say that was one of our favorites as well. \n\nSo back to the shrimp. OMG they were so good, and as soon as Carina bought out or dinner she asked us if we wanted to go ahead and get started on another order of shrimp so that way, but the time we may be done with our first order, more shrimp would already be on the way. She did this for us each time and I finally threw in the towel after my 2nd order but my friend ended up having about five orders. Carina let us know that our first order has ten shrimp in each dish and the orders after have about 7 or 8. Weird but hey, keeps the waste down I suppose. I was beyond stuffed when it was all said and done and very happy. The head manager came over and said hello and to make sure that we were happy with our meals. Very nice. Needless to say, it was a great time and the food was very good.
1 ||| Terrible customer service. When I walk in, not one person greets me. The employees are too absorbed in conversation and don't notice the customers walking in. \n\nAfter I had looked around plenty and found some things I wanted to buy from the motor clothes department I was ready to check out. The two girls behind the counter were talking to someone for a long time while I waited. Several sales people were standing close by but never nodded or felt it'd be helpful to ask if I needed help. I figured I'd walk around the customer service island and wait behind the man they were talking to so I'd get noticed. As soon as I got close, the two motor clothes girls saw me approach and broke off conversation, turned away and went back to looking busy. I had to raise my voice and ask if I could pay for this.  One was noticeably bothered and gave me the most curt, annoyed service I'd ever received. \n\nThis was during Bike Week when you'd think the store would be prepared to service the customers. The store was not so busy that they wouldn't notice. Every where I looked, staff was mostly standing around talking with other \"shirt wearing\" employees.
2 ||| I like to think I'm a somewhat decent person.  So, after a completely horrifying experience at Amlee, I decided to give it another shot.  I figured maybe I was having a bad day, the workers were having a bad day, and it wasn't fair to judge them solely on one bad experience.  That, and I was inspired by someone's posting of a picture of Amlee's general chicken which looked absolutely delicious.\n\nSo I decided to order a lunch special to go (disguising my voice over the phone, so I wouldn't be recognized as the asshole who didn't tip last time, thereby prompting them to spit in my food).  When I arrived to pick it up, the Asian owner was there.  She was much nicer to me, all smiles, and she even offered me extra rice without me asking (!!!).  Which makes me think maybe she saw my earlier review...  In which case, I'm sorry I called you a bitch.\n\nThe general chicken was pretty good -- much better than the strawberry chicken I had  tried there last time.  I decided to bump up my review to a 3.  See what happens when you're nice to your customers? :)
2 ||| I haven't been inside in so long. Went to the Jason Mraz concert here. The old Colisseum is still holding up after all these years.
0 ||| Lost my pants from 3pc suit. Great . Oh i'm sorry.  Here's a hundred bucks.  Go find some.  I would rather have the pants and go elsewhere.   Make sure you have receipts for your clothes. You will need
4 ||| Great breakfast place the chorizo omelet is my favorite so far. Huge portions and unbelievably cheap price for what your getting. The pumpkin bread is great also. Nothing is better then the fried zucchini as an appetizer it's crazy good a must try.
1 ||| It was LOUD.  Loud is a deal-breaker for me.  This is my 5th time at Steiners but the first time I've been so totally turned off!  Last night was blasting-headache-inducing noise with the music cranked way up.  The service was casual to an extreme, the tables had not been cleaned and I was disappointed in the food.  We both had the angel hair pasta (tasty) with shrimp (bland).  Probably if you want to watch the game and are into the \"Cheers\" atmosphere mentioned earlier, with a burger and beer, this will work.  But for an evening when you can sit and yak, kick back and catch up with friends, not so much.
1 ||| Visited recently for the first time. I've had this place bookmarked for a minute and I was majorly disappointed. Coffee Pub has all of the makings of a hole-in-the-wall/hidden gem, but doesn't stack up. \n\nWe were instantly greeted and sat, but it took about 5 minutes before a waitress came over. The place wasn't busy at all. Our drinks came out quickly and their iced coffee and espresso based drinks are amazing.\n\nStaff was very friendly. Looking forward to visiting again.
3 ||| We ventured out to Joyful House with another couple and had another very good meal but not a five-star dining experience.  The broth of Seafood Wor Wonton Soup was quite flavorful, and the filled wontons very memorable, but a scary-looking Calamari, tough scallops, and inferior pork made the soup a story of contrasts.  Average-sized pan-fried Potstickers were good and I received my several requested condiments of sliced ginger, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Potsticker Sauce with onions, Hoisin Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil without any difficulty, and Shrimp-Fried Rice with carrots and peas was very good.  \n\nBeef & Snow Peas with Black Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce was a sumptuous Cantonese dish, and Kung Pao Chicken had a nice level of controlled heat.  Service by the well-trained and disciplined staff was consistently on the ball and responsive to needs.\n\nFour solid stars this time out!
4 ||| Brought both of my vehicles here in the last few weeks....exceptional service and always the best prices...Scott the service rep I've dealt with was really great, went out of his way to find me a tire when the website didn't have any affordable tires in stock....I have a big O behind my house but will go outta my way to bring all my vehicles to this discount
3 ||| There's a enormous selection of food to choose from- so not only cheescakes here.  I had dinner here, had the chipotle pasta, etc... There was a long wait for our food after we ordered- about 30 minutes... The food was good, everything was cooked okay, but was not a fan of the bread in the basket- the taste was bit off.  Our service was okay and the waiter checked on us throughout our meal.  I did try their cheesecake- nothing too different from any other one.  The only thing I could suggest to the restaurant is maybe increase the lighting just a bit more.
0 ||| I am going to defer to the review of Melissa Y, who says it all:\n\nWhat is the big fuss? And Why is this place still open?\n\nAs many who have read my reviews know, my wife is Korean, and we are picky about our Korean BBQ. This place is not worth the time and trouble to cross the street and park here.\n\nThe quality is really poor, the place is dirty, and they seem to have an attitude.\n\nI could say more negetive things, but it would be pointless.\n\nDrive further down Spring Mountain, and give Korean Garden BBQ a try. Much better quality, better service, and oh, it's very clean.
4 ||| This was my first stay in a LaQuinta since a very terrible experience in a LQ a couple years ago.  I didn't book it, so it was out of my hands.  But my experience at this hotel changed my view on the company...  maybe a little bit in the positive direction.\n\nStaff - Amazingly friendly, at ALL HOURS of the day.  3 am and have a question?  Like asking your Auntie for a favor.\n\nRooms - Decent and updated.  WIRELESS!!!  Plenty of channels on the boob tube, lots of counter space in the bathroom, big desk to get work done.\n\nPrice - incredibly reasonable.  We didn't use the free breakfast, but should have.  Beats the heck out of where we did go.\n\nThanks Charlotte LQ - and I hope \"El Corpo\" appreciates your efforts.  Other LQ's could learn from you!
2 ||| Meh, this has never been a super impressive shop in my opinion. However I still try it out every time I'm down in the area. There's lots of cool, old and interesting stuff to peak at. You can walk around and imagine yourself taking a leap into the past. Mixed in there are lots of other oddities and arguably not everything in here is an authentic antique. When it says \"imported\" it probably means made in China within the past decade. Again, that's a small percentage of the stuff here and there really are a lot of old originals to be found.\n\nI guess I find myself bored every time I come back around. I haven't seen anything new pop up in here. When I first came in it was packed and overflowing out into the courtyard behind it. Now the courtyard is pretty desolate and has only rusted and broken old things remaining. Prices are so high that I've never once considered buying anything. It's as if the shopkeeper is slowly trying to move out everything and not bringing anything new in at the same time. Speaking of which, he can be a bit hard to communicate with at times. Not much for talking amicably.
0 ||| Horrible service every time.
0 ||| Beware, this store does not allow returns or exchanges on their costumes. All purchases are final, even if you get it home and it is defective in some way. They do not allow you try on certain costume pieces, such as wigs, so you really have no way of knowing if it is functional or not until you pay for it (overpriced) and get home. Then you're stuck with it whether you like it or not. What you shoud do is use Bubbles of Joy just to try on the costume that you want, get the sizing right, then go buy it from amazon for half the price and the freedom to return it if it is defective. Bubbles of Joy is lame.
4 ||| This was my first time going to this salon. I found a groupon for it and decided to try it out. When I first arrived I didn't really think much of it. The outside was just a normal looking store. However, once I entered I was instantly impressed. Everything was so chic and clean. I loved the atmosphere. Katie cut my hair and she was fantastic! She made me feel totally comfortable and was super kind. I totally recommend everyone to go here!
0 ||| If you like watered down coffee, margarine, processed cheese product, and soggy toast, then this is the place for you. They know how to under cook and burn potatoes at the same time. Cheap, yes. And it shows.
4 ||| Extremely honest, great work and amazing prices. I had them repair a wheel issue on my car. For no charge the mechanic also hid some wires I never got around to moving for the DYI back-up camera I installed.
1 ||| I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.
4 ||| The rangoon-type starter was absolutely delicious, filled with oniony, garlicy cream cheese and provided with a spicy sauce, it was the best I've ever had.  The Sate Ayam was perfectly cooked and the sauce was very tasty.  I really didn't like the rice, I thought it was bland and sticky, but if it is traditional Indonesian, I don't have a problem with it and it really didn't mar my meal at all.  The cucumbers were wonderful.\nService was fine, I went there for lunch and was the first one in the restaurant so I had no trouble at all.  The server recommended the rangoon and I am very glad she did.  I will definetely be returning.
2 ||| I can't work at home because the bed always calls my name. So I needed a place to go where it would slightly uncomfortable to sleep at, offered free-wi-fi and possibly have cute boys I can pretend to not stare at. \n\nMama Java's fulfilled one of my requirements: it was definitely not  a place I could nap at. There are lots of tables, not enough outlets for your laptop and only ONE couch that I wouldn't even think about having drunk sex on. To be fair, this is a coffee shop, not a whore house so ignore my last comment. \n\nWhat I meant was that it isn't a cozy place, rather cold, actually. I'm used to smaller coffee places where its warm from the steaming coffee cups, the closeness of people sitting around me and the many couches or arm chairs. I just need a hug at Mama Java's. \n\nThere was only one guy at the counter when I was there and a long line but I don't have anything important to get to so I didn't mind the wait. I ordered a non-fat chai latte and it okay. Too sugary and strong spices.\n\nI'm actually writing this review as I'm finishing up here at Mama Java's. It's getting cold and I have to go pee really bad, so I have to wrap up this review and head home, which is just down the street. I have a shy bladder.
4 ||| Old school charm, delish sandwiches. Cafeteria style service with custom options and delivery. My fave? Turkey reuben with kraut and thousand island of course, melted Swiss served grilled on rye. \n\nEverything is ala carte, so if you want fries or chips or another side, you'll have to order it or grab it yourself.\n\nNice alternative to typical food court offerings without sacrificing quality for price or speed.
0 ||| Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast. \n\nI wanted a draft beer and was told that \"we don't serve draft beer upstairs\". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The \"lobster rolls\" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The \"lobster\" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous. \n\nI won't be back. Ever.
1 ||| Had an amazingly delicious chimi plate and excellent service but, I won't be going back until they take down their 'no guns' sign. Took 3 stars off for that.
0 ||| I was on my way from Tucson to Sacramento when one of my tires went flat. I was in the middle of Phoenix at the time, so I was able to get right off the freeway and head over to this Pep Boys shop. They looked at the tire and found a nail next to the sidewall which they said meant that the tire couldn't be repaired. They said they had one in stock that they could put on, so I agreed to this and was on may way after about an hour and a half. That was good. What wasn't so good was that they failed to let me know that the tire they put on is not a run-flat tire. That's not a good thing for my car - an '06 BMW 330i. This car requires run-flat tires as it has neither a spare tire nor a place to put one. (BMW has received many earfuls of complaints on this, BTW.) I didn't quiz them on this, so some of it is my own fault, but I do expect a place that sells tires to understand which tires do and do not go with specific car models. The upshot of this is that had that tire picked up a nail somewhere in the desert between Barstow and Needles, I'd have been forced to have someone tow me in, at great expense. I can't begin to emphaize how much that would have pissed me off, so I guess we're all fortunate that didn't happen. As it is, I'll need to either get that tire replaced (with the attendant $200 down the drain) or get a can of fix-a-flat and hope that nothing happens to it anytime soon. Those are not good options.
2 ||| Given the recent yelp love this place has received (and being in my fave zip code), I decided it was high time to give it a try.  \n\nParking was tough to find, and it was busy but not too busy when we went inside. The waitress was a little distracted and missed my initial order for horchata (a cinnamon rice milk drink).  I finally did get it, and, like at Three Amigos, it just wasn't so great. Very grainy, and not the smooth creamy deliciousness that you seem to always get at joints in Chicago. So, a no-go on the horchata.  \n\nI then ordered two bean and one cheese pupusas.  The cheese one was much better than the bean, but, in general, they were m'eh. It's basically fried bread and beans covered in salsa, which, by it's very nature, is going to be good, but I wasn't over the moon about them.  I actually thought the tostones and the chicken tamales that my significant other ordered totally eclipsed the pupusas, and if I were to go back, I'd definitely stick with the tamales because you can't easily make them at home (although we sometimes try) and they are just so freaking delicious when they are made well.\n\nSo, this place was perfectly fine, but I'm in no hurry to go back.
3 ||| Great food but service was a little slow, seemed under staffed. Overall very reasonable for the quality and quantity
2 ||| I have always loved The Spaghetti Factory.. the food is still good but our service was possibly the worst I have ever had. We had to ask for everything and waited and waited for him to bring what we had asked for, had to ask the hostess for items because the thing our server did best was disappear. Our dessert was served with the dirty dishes on the table and he failed to bring clean spoons. What a disapointment as we were celebrating a birthday..
4 ||| Simple fast and good food.  Order, pay, eat and leave.  It's really kind of refreshing and then you get guality food in addition. It's kind of a no brainer. Affordable and good portion sizes as well.  The service is actually pretty nice too.
4 ||| Great french toast especially the cinnamon french toast!!!
0 ||| You are a horrible company!!! http://www.goldsgym.com/contact/ this link shows that there is a place to cancel your account, then why did I get billed a month later? I called your THIRD PARTY CALL CENTER, that is very rude and has no idea what customer service is!!! A manager cold transferred me to her manager voice mail so she did not have to deal with me!!! This is ridiculous, I am going on all social media and tearing you down!! 24 hour fitness is substantially better then you!!! Go learn how to treat your customers, you have been going down hill and you USE to be a power gym but NOW you are just a bunch of scam artist trying to make some money to stay alive. Go out of business!
0 ||| I remember this place being a lot better.  I was up at Desert Ridge and decided to check out one of my favorite restaurants for dinner since it was my birthday.  My favorite go-to dish for this place is the Pasta Milano.  I remember first eating it in highschool and have loved it ever since.  Every time I visit, this is what I order, sans mushrooms of course.  Ew, fungus.  The bread seemed a bit bland, but the side caesar salad I ordered with my meal was tasty enough.  The pasta, however was completely different than I remember it.  It was bland, nearly tasteless and the chicken tasted like it came out of one of those microwaveable bags you buy at the deli at the grocery store that has pre-cooked bags of chicken to throw into salads.  Fake chicken? Bland pasta sauce? Bland bread? Not what I remembered from this place.  Definitely not worth the $38 we spent for the meal and I will not be returning ever again.  What happened to the Macaroni Grill I remembered?\nWhat a disappointing birthday dinner.
0 ||| I came to Georgetowne Inn with already low expectations, as a group of us were going for Valentine's dinner on a weekend and the restaurant had been chosen already, and I did my research on yelp after I learned of the choice. \n\nWe had a reservation, yet still waited ONE HOUR. The hostesses were rude and unprofressional. Maybe I have too high of standards; i'm from Chicago i'm sorry. But if you're going to charge that much for a restaurant and pretend to be all fancy, your staff must also get that memo. We waited by the bar area, and each time the hostess announced someone's table was ready, she would say \"settle your tab with the bar and i'll seat you\". That is just fine if this is a pub or some TGI Friday-esque restaurant, but for a fancy \"top knotch\" restaurant? Management needs to be slapped. \n\nWhen our table was finally open, the waitress literally took 20 more minutes to set the table with plates and an assortment of cutlery and napkins. I say assortment, because when we sat down (they told us they wouldn't be showing us to our table, we could just go sit - this tells me they're tired of us asking when our table will be ready. Also that there are absolutely NO MANNERS to be found at this establishment) each person was either missing a napkin, or a fork, or a spoon, or a knife. \n\nLike many other reviewers, the only reason this place deserves a star is because of the view. And like those same reviewers, I agree that the survival of this place is only because of that view. \n\nI ordered the petite new york strip - rare, which came out medium so I sent it back. Fine; but even the rare steak was bland (my husband said that he could cook a better steak than that) and my baked potato looked and tasted like it'd be baked for a few hours too long. French onion soup was eh, spinach salad with warm bacon dressing actually had a sweet bacon COLD dressing. Fine, whatever. Can everyone in this establishment just get on the same page? The waitress also never asked if we wanted drinks; maybe because this restaurant always has a long wait, they're used to people getting drinks at the bar. \n\nI will NEVER EVER EVER return. If you want to eat a dinner that you could very well make for yourself by buying everything at Giant Eagle and just kind of cooking it in any sort of random fashion, you will probably have the same meal as you would get here. PASS.\n\nAnd if you're ever in Chicago, do go to The Signature Room at the Hancock center. Their views are amazing, and their food and service is equally amazing. \n\nGeorgetowne Inn needs to travel a bit outside their narrow world where their type of \"food\" and service might have worked at one point, and learn where the rest of the world is going.
0 ||| They did a horrible job. Not recommended.
3 ||| Since I moved to Tempe a year and a half ago this has become my favorite Pizza Shop, by far. They have the best part of NY style pizza right there on the counter: The Shakies, all the goodies that you can shake on top. I'm a Garlic Powder, Parmesan, Red Pepper guy myself. I hate when a shop says it's NY style and has no shakies, that's part of the style, go to NYC and you'll see. If you get the slice special, you won't be eating for awhile, good deal for the money you pay. O and they have wings, mmmm, god-like wings made the right way with Frank's Red Hot.\n The only reason that I cannot give Venazia's 5 stars is because of a couple bad delivery experiences. The last time I waited an hour and 15 minutes before calling to check my status. The owner(Brian?) answered and explained that I had called back and said that i was picking it up instead( o, really?). I asked him why he didn't call after the order sat over an hour, plus the fact that whenever I call they already have my number, so a different number would have called and no one on this earth knew I ordered anyways. He didn't seem to care either way, which is bad customer service, especially for a loyal customer. So I felt kind of slighted. But I won't let that stop me from eating their great food, I only eat-in now  :D
3 ||| I stopped by Pride Cleaners on Saturday and dropped off two suits and two shirts. Ended up costing about $40 which is a little more than I am used to spending, but they did a really great job and my clothes were ready to go on time.\n\nOpen until 6pm on weekdays works for me.
0 ||| Ate their brisket last night.  It wasn't good at all.  Restaurant was pretty dead.  I'm surprised the rating is so high.
1 ||| It always seems like I visit Ulta when I'm looking my worst.  I am not sure why this is.  Maybe it's because I look in the mirror and realize that I am in dire need of overpriced cosmetics to salvage my face for the day.  Whatever the reason, I always keep ending up here.  That being said, I don't know why I really keep coming back, especially since the nearby JCPenney has a Sephora now (which is infinitely better).  \n\nThe last time I visited, the Lancome salesperson scared me a little bit.  Lancome makes my favorite formula of lipstick, and I decided I wanted a new shade.  I asked for the salesperson's advice, and she pulls out this light, frosty pink shade.  I was dubious, but I tried it anyway... I was one acid-wash jacket away from having a total 80's throwback moment.  Worst of all, she tried to tell me that it made me look \"radiant.\"  Wow.  I really wonder how these people receive their training.  On more than one occasion, I've been \"pimped\" something that very obviously doesn't work for me.  One sales associate tried to sell me the wrong shade of foundation... when you demo a foundation and your client has the skin tone of an overripe banana, you've done something wrong.  \n\nAlso, the sales associates are few and far between and have, on multiple occasions, refused to leave whatever stocking job they are working on to help me.  I have also had to wait in line for waaaaaay too long several times because one poor salesperson was stuck ringing people up while the others stood around shooting the breeze.\n\nSephora... Sephora's where it's at.  Not Ulta.  Ick.
3 ||| Have been going to the Bar area of this Native New Yorker for some time now,\ngreat service,  all the servers know us.   Food is pretty good.   Drink menu is very good,  nice selection.   Lots of class flat screens to view sports.   Cant give it 5 stars because this place has the worst god awful sound system of any of the places I go to.   Has a irritating internet juke box that plays itself every 5 minutes with some garbage songs you cant understand.   This is a sports bar/restaurant.   Listening to a garbled over modulated with bass sound system all the time is getting old.  Does keep me from going sometimes thinking about the blast of bad speakers I have to endure talking to my wife.    If you can enure the bad too loud music everything else is worth it.
0 ||| Valle Luna Chandler\n\nMy wife and I were kid free the other night and were deciding where to go and deducted down to Valle Luna because of the lakeside setting. We got there and parked in the lot and the very first thing you see in the front parking lot is an overflowing open gated nasty dumpster with boxes and rotton food spewing out. We nearly turned around and said S@REW THIS, but we didn't.\n\nInside we asked the host for patio seating which she said was booked; however, there was first-come-first-serve on the bar patio. Scored a ringside seat next to the lake! Yippie! I'm so gettin' some tonight with this setting. However, the ambiance was really marred by 2 things. First was the wafting of clouds of cigarette smoke lofting into our serene spot. Ewww, not to be a hypocrite as I smoked like 12 years ago..no check that cigarettes are gross. The other issue was the EXTREMELY INTOXICATED middle aged foul mouthed trashy cougar hooker seated behind us. Her and her skank girlfriend sat down about 1/2 hour after we did and she was friggin' hammered upon being seated. She later exclaimed to her friend about how she'd been drinking wine ALL DAY...yea really, you handle and hide it well. I totally shook my head as I watched the server dude take her order and thought, \"Dude you're not really going to serve that sloshy puddle more booze are you?\" and he did - and multiple times. Unbelievable! Where's the Liquor Board when they're needed. \n\nThe other issue about the facility is the stank in the bar area. It has the aroma of a high school boys locker room. They really need to address this as it's nasty...carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned this millennium. \n\nYou can't go wrong drinking a Corona Light in this atmoshere and my wife had a Don Julio Blanca Marg Rocks that was good to. Later she prdered teh same but with a Chambord shot in it...awesome drink!\n\nMy wife loves that they serve a bean dip with the chips and I thought the salsa was very tasty and chunky. I hate it when the salsa is watery thin. Chips were good ny wife said as I don't eat them. \n\nMy wife had red cili enchiladas that were just ok...nothing special. I was pleased to see sea bass on the menu...yea! Ordered it but the server forgot to ask me which of the 2 sauces I wanted or about the sides. I flagged him down and told him the sauce and also said that I didn't want any rice. Food comes, there's the friggin' rice all over my plate. I'm not really picky but seriously I asked specifically for no rice and there it is and it's not like you can just push it aside as it crosses the international borders into the veggies, beans and fish sauce...forced to have a re-make. 8 minutes later and my wife is 1/2 done and here it comes back out. Looks good...taste is stone cold...what a shame as it was a good looking piece of fish. \n\nWithout that lake...we would never come back.
1 ||| \"I know you can be overwhelmed, and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?\"\n\nSo sayeth the teenage movie, and so it is with Black Angus. Thoroughly and utterly whelming..\n\nLet me start by saying the only truly aggravating thing was that they were out of 2 different kinds of red wine and there were maybe 4 glass choices to begin with. After the next one wasn't available by the glass I just kind of gave up and let my husband pick. \n\nMy husband had the Prime Rib, Garlic Mash and Broccoli. I had the Bacon Blue Butter Ribeye, Loaded Baked Potato and Caesar Salad. We split the Crispy Garlic-Pepper Zucchini things and White Chocolate Cheesecake. At the risk of being redundant, if I don't specify something it was adequate. \n\nThe Prime Rib 12 oz. had no crust on it. Zero. So it was basically a hunk o' roasted meat. The Garlic Mashed was not garlicky and texture was way off.\n\nThe Ribeye was thin. Like IHOP steak thin. \n\nThe two stars is mostly because the price implies that something will be really good. And nothing was. For $100 (our meal plus tip) you get better quality, service and value at Outback, Yard House, etc. \n\nThanks Black Angus! I now know what it is to be whelmed.
4 ||| What a surprise.  On the industrial North Side of town.  \n\nGuacamole made table side to taste.  Food was great, service was dialed in.  Price was reasonable.\n\nBeats the heck out of those strip restaurants that shine up for tourists.
4 ||| Perfect destination for a special occasion. The view of Pittsburgh's skyline and all three rivers is beautiful and complemented the amazing service. Our server was extremely personable and knowledgable about the menu. His recommendations did not disappoint. The warm, romantic ambiance of the dining room makes you want to stay even after you've finished your meal. Everything from the crabcake appetizer, lobster bisque, entrees, dessert and cappuccinos were delicious.
2 ||| 3/16 Update:\n\nI've decided to remove two stars from my rating because my recent visits have just been disappointing.  The grilled pork is more baked than grilled - no smokiness or tasty charred bits anywhere.  The pho tastes more of MSG than boiled beef bones.  And service is as bad as ever.  I wonder if Da Vang's popularity has led it to take shortcuts for efficiency.  \n\nDefinitely not worth going out of your way for - go to Khai Hoan in Tempe for the smokey grilled pork or Saigon Nites in Scottsdale for the delicious pho instead.\n\nPrior review:\n\nEssential pre-eating check list for Da Vang\n\n1.   Turn your expectation on service down to zero\n2.   Voluntary separation of  restaurant decor & atmosphere from the dining experience\n3.  Limited peripheral vision is a plus\n\nNow you're ready to enjoy one of the tastiest Vietnamese place this side of San Jose.
0 ||| food is awful, place filled with flies.  BABIES KIDS CRYING ALL THE TIME, management lets them make your time there not pleasant.  Would not recommend\nthem at all.
1 ||| i should have walked out the moment i walked in.\n\nduck taped massage chairs??? \n\ncreepy chairs lined agains the wall with fans at the feet? \n\nwe were told pedicures were $20 but they failed to mention the ridiculous $2 upcharge if you pay with a debit or credit card. \n\nit was so hot in there, too. they need to turn on the ac. \n\nit was awful. never again.
4 ||| What a homestyle Starbucks.  I know all Starbucks feel like this but, this particular SB is home home homestyle, it's warm and the employees are always high spirited when I come in.  My order is always right, bathroom is clean and it smells like coffee! Duh!\n\nIt also has a nice outdoor seating area where you can enjoy this beautiful LV weather!\n\nThe shopping area its in is nice and has alot other great eateries too!
2 ||| Excellent cheese selection.\n\nBeautiful homemade pasta and sauces...I can't say enough about how good every single sauce I have tried is, served with their perfect pasta. \n\nI've had to edit my review of Pasta & Provisions for one simple reason. Their store is so unorganized, and their staff so lazy and unmotivated that it is a chore to try to shop there.\n\nI can't remember the last time I went to their store that all of the items that I purchased made it home in my bag. They will randomly leave out at least one item every trip.\n\nI don't know if this is an effort to increase their profits by stealing from their customers, or if their front counter staff are just that incompetent. But, even with a concerted effort, I still end up at home unpacking my bag, wondering how exactly that I don't have the bread I purchased, or the cheeses, or the ham... or whatever it is that they have charged me for that they didn't put in the bag.\n\nDon't try to call to complain either! There is NEVER any management or owner there, and you will talk with a high school aged person, who doesn't know and doesn't care.
4 ||| Yum yum yum!!! I had the spicy tuna salad and was not expecting what I got. It was a wonderful suprise! The spicy dressing was not overpowering and did not take away from my tuna. I will definately eat there again and again! The service was wonderful!
3 ||| Stopped by here for dinner today.  Ordered a jamaican patty and a jerk chicken meal.  The patty was good.  Not really flaky but the filling was seasoned just perfectly.  The jerk chicken was a little disappointing.  The chicken was a little dry and I just tasted heat as opposed to flavor.   I didn't like their vegetable stir fry at all.  The rice was okay though\n\nThe prices are a little high, but their portions are GIGANTIC.  I did not expect to get basically a half chicken order so that was nice to have some portions to take home for the future.
4 ||| I love Trader Joe's! Every time I go on a trip I always have to go there. They have the best candies and snacks for a cheap price.  They are also a grocery store and they have anything from milk to wines and olive oils. I always go up there for their variety of snacks and goodies to bring back to my co-wokers, family and firends.\n\nMy favorite is the cinnimon flavord almons. I also like to eat the Lady Fingers, but I have recently found out that they discontinued them. I wish they had a trader joe's here is hawaii, because that would be great.
4 ||| $5 Filipino breakfast offered ALLLL DAY?!  I'm sold!\n\nPerfect way to start a Vegas morning.  You get your choice of tocino, longanisa, tilipia or the dried/salted fish.  Then you pick how you want your eggs cooked...and they whip it up for your right there.  Probably only takes about 10 minutes!  The longanisa + scrambled egg is my ideal and it was really good here!  Add in the fresh calamansi juice...and life is good.  \n\nThey had a huge selection of food to choose from, so I pretty much wanted to buy everything.  Luckily, I restrained.
4 ||| This restaurant delivers on taste, presentation and the view.  My wife and I came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed their gourmet  duck dish and a fabulous creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e  for dessert.  Service was impeccable!
2 ||| I hadn't been here since the yelp event last year. The chips and salsa are to die for and it it took everything in me not to eat all of the, since I call myself being \"good\". I did order the shrimp tacos (sans the tortilla) which were delicious and the service was great. I will definitely come back again to see how things are during happy hour and heck just for the chips and salsa.
4 ||| Thankfully, Barbs is in  walking distance to my house. This is a great place for your hangover cure, and your wallet will say  \"thank you sir/mam may I have another\" as it is DIRT CHEAP.\n\nBarbs does breakfast, and they do it well, catering to the hearty working class Pittsburgh appetite.  They have a wide selection of Omelets, and you can order biscuits and gravy on the side (my go to fat kid breakfast item).\n\nThe waitress is spot on with coffee and anything else you may need. \n\nEverything was just what the doctor ordered, well, maybe not since I put hot sauce and mayo on everything, but thats another story. Unpretentious, filling, cheap, hearty, delicious.
2 ||| Service was great, however, the food was mediocre.  Hostess needs to be more educated about the menu, she was unable to give details on menu items.\nLets start the with fries that seem to be mandatory with each entree.  They had to be cooked prior to us ordering, or even getting there.  They were cold, limp (pause) and over salted.  The burger was just eh.  Grilled onions seemed to be just warmed on the grill, and the beef patty could have used a bit more flavor.  Fat has the flavor people!\n\nOh, the floor at our first table was filthy.  Then the table at the second table was filthy.  What's up with that?\n\nOverall, this joint was not that great.
0 ||| this is crazy but why cant I use my UPS account in a UPS store...?  I can ship on my UPS account and off site locations all over town but not at the UPS Store...  WTF!\n\nAnd the man that works in this location is pure evil..  Never go here and expect customer service..  it wont happen.\n\nAgain, you can only ship on your UPS account when you have already printed a label, they dont carry UPS shipping forms at the UPS Store. They do have them at Mail Plus in Tempe, these guys are the best!   If you pre-print a label then just schedule a pick up and you dont have to deal with these inconsiderate jerks..\n\nSOOOOOOOO DUMB!!!
2 ||| SO, DON'T STAY HERE IF YOU HAVE OPTIONS. WHY U ASK???  \nOK, let's just say I LOVE history and architecture, but 3stars equals one faucet for hot AND cold water, a shower bigger than 2ft x 2ft, more privacy via better insulation (lets just say I know when both of  my neighbors were having moments of \"intimacy\", one just got done, that's why I'm writing my review, because it's like I WAS THERE!!!!!!) \n3stars = furniture that was made before 1965. OK, then lets recap.. No thermostat, so you have ZERO control over your temp for your room, TV was old school, as was the furniture, carpeting, bathroom (2 faucets 1hot and 1cold, not both under 1... Shower being ICE cold one second and SCAULDING HOT the next second without warning, the terrible internet connection (which did not work the first night, then I told the front desk clerk and their response was to use the internet on the 1st floor even though I was located on the 5th floor, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE) \nThe valet parking attendant who tried to pick up my friend, or well, why don't u enjoy ur stay here and write a review for me to ENJOY?? Location is the only thing this hotel has going for it, unless u live in a tent, are homeless, or can afford to spend cash on a terribly overrated hotel. IF this is 3 stars, I'm a millionaire, by reading this review, you know Im not, and this hotel is a joke... Ok, check the swimming pool and tell me how you're going to get a tan... 3stars my A**
2 ||| Ok I'll be honest. Only good things about this place? The paper on the tables and the bread. Their food has always been inconsistent with me and my family. I love the bread at the beginning as it's a good thing to have if the food takes to long, and me being an artist and having the table with paper on it in front of me is probably the greatest thing I've ever seen.\nI just can't give them a good rating since their food and service is always on the bad side.
0 ||| I went into this place for the first time today. I almost gagged when I found out what the prices were. The selection is incredible. But the prices give you a bend over and grab your ankles feeling. But it's a free market, he can charge what he wants to. I'm not going to support this kind of exorbitant pricing.
1 ||| Not the best location.  Had to ask if we should sit ourselves. No sign or anything explaining that.  Definitely a neighborhood dive.  Decor hadn't been updated since 1980.  Our waitress (the owner?) never smiled.  The other waitress could have covered up some.  Looked like she was going to a club. Try explaining that to your 10 year old son :-)   Kitchen was open so I got to watch one guy do all the work while muscular short dude stood around.   Lots of takeout while we were there.  Restaurant full of smoke when we walked in.  Son had a slice of cheese pizza.  The pizza slice was on the smallish side but he said it was good.  I ordered a calzone with meatballs and mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms but not much meatball.  Almost nonexistent.  Tons of ricotta too.  Almost to the point of being too much. It was cheap but probably won't go back.
3 ||| So I happened upon this place after I was searching for a new place to get a breakfast sandwich here on Yelp. I live in Dilworth, so it isn't too far. They had a great variety of breakfast and regular sandwiches and also many flavors of coffee, which I love. I got the Americano breakfast sandwich, which is huge, and a large cinnamon hazelnut coffee. Both were delicious. It was a little more than I would usually pay, but considering the large size, well worth it. \nThe only thing that I didn't like was the lack of seating with tables. I had planned to eat there and then run other errands, but all they have are benches outside, with nowhere to set my coffee and sandwich. If they could add some tables, it would be great. I do plan to come back and try some of their regular sandwiches in the future as well.
0 ||| This place is terrible. There is a reason that the tans are $5.\n\nTheir equipment is old (like from the 90s) and a little sketchy. The person at the front doesn't calibrate properly for your skin, so be sure you know your limits and start slow (don't go with their recommendations)!. My skin has never been the same. I went and spent 12 minutes in a booth, and I left burnt. My skin felt wierd and hot and papery for days, and I think I got cancer of the soul. I never got tan. Just for reference, I tan very easily in the real sun and rarely burn. In fact, I'm tan right now. I usually get my tan on outside, but I had guests and couldn't be nude per usual in my yard, so I went here to get even before a big event. Do not do that, ever, at any tanning place. I've even seen sitcoms about the disastrous consequences of such folly. But I digress.\n\nThis place is skanky and their equipment sucks. Do not go here. Eventually it will go out of business and Darwin will be proved right once again.
3 ||| For a public course in Vegas, this one is pretty good.  Not great, not horrible.  There are other courses in SoNV and SoUT that I would rather play.\n\nPlayed it yesterday for the first time since May, and the course is in great shape.  (They just finished overseeding recently, and with the great weather we've been having the fairways and greens are looking good.)\n\nThe course is a bit narrow and there are a few holes with blind shots where you can't even see the flag from the women's tees.\n\nMy big knock on this course (as of yesterday) was that on #17, there is goose poop all over the place.  I mean... everywhere... on the fairway, on the green, on the cement, everywhere.  The geese love this hole for some reason.\n\nThe plus side is .... they have a really nice proshop and the bar/restaurant is surprisingly good.
4 ||| This is a review for the restaurant right off the lobby. Very nice. The best iced tea I've had in a long time, delicious quinoa salad. The guy had a very good mac and cheese and perfectly cooked steamed asparagus. I would recommend this place for lunch if you're in the area.
4 ||| We were making a large purchase of Magic Cards to run an employee tournament and called to see if they would price match.  We could get 3 boxes with overnight shipping of $40 for less than the cost of 3 boxes at the store and they refused to drop the price at all.\n\nLittle Shop of Magic matched the price.  Glad we were able to support a local store and we clearly know where we are doing all of our future business.
0 ||| This is the worst store. The employees are all super rude and to busy standing around to actually help you. When asking a question they all have a different answer. I'm all for current good music but this store has it playing so loud you can barley think. I'm not at a club just trying to buy some glasses. Then on top of everything we bought a pair of swim trunks got them home and they did not even take off the security tag. Really lady you had one job!!!
2 ||| Cheap and the course is decent but the staff is horendous. The starter is very unprofessional and they are not on time. If you book a 3pm tee time then expect to go on the first tee around 3:40pm. The staff don't even communicate the correct information with each other either. 1 guy told me to go to the tee box and shortly after another chased me down telling me I didn't have a tee time and calling me a liar HAHA! Not coming back here unless I'm in dire need of cheap golf
0 ||| Worst restaurant service/experience I have had in Charlotte. Went there for brunch and service was terrible. My omelet was a lovely shade of brown. Couldn't even complain, because server was no where to be found.  Took over an hour to wait for our checks after we finished eating. Manager was unapologetic and rude as well. Never going there again.
3 ||| Great little place for cold beer after work! Go visit Sherry the bartender Wednesday thru Friday 11:00 - 6:00pm (and every other weekend days)! Not only is she hot but she's quick with your drinks and always friendly.\n\nBar food is a bit limited and is going to be deep fried, but they do good lunch specials everyday.
1 ||| Underwhelming. Disappointing. Overpriced. Overrated.\n\nParking: Valet only or blocks away - every parking area/structure near the entrance is private parking.\n\nWait time: none, which was nice. But we had to ask for everything. For small plates, for the little soy sauce bowls, for water.... everything. Nothing was really anticipated of our needs.\n\nDrinks: ordered 2 martinis - one gin & one vodka - we got 2 gin martinis. sent it back and received a smaller vodka portion than the gin martini which had been 3-4sips in\n\nWe didn't find one thing on the \"specials menu\" that sounded appetizing (mango was in more than half the dishes)... and even the basics for sushi did not seem all to great.\n\nSUSHI:\nEdamame - delicious\n\nDragonfly roll (spicy tuna, crab/avocado & asparagus flaw fried & plated with spicy teriyaki sauce) and didn't find any tuna in any part of the roll\n\nGodzilla roll (California Roll topped with Spicy Tuna & tempura chips) the spicy tuna on top was more like a minced tuna paste as if it was the soup part of the bottom of the bowl the was scrapped together.. very little tuna, way more paste/sauce\n\nBest Tip about this place: meh... no wait time? it was a Saturday night at 7pm and only half the place was filled.
1 ||| When Chipotle first arrived in Vegas, I was a huge fan. Never had a Mexican fast food experience like this before. Then Zabas came along, pretty much stealing the same concept but with a broader menu and ingredient selection. I have to admit that since Zabas came into the picture, I haven't been to a Chipotle! This was my first visit in at least five or six years, if not more.\n\nI was surprised to see that they now offer brown rice, perhaps taking a page out of Zabas book and stealing a concept from them. What they were lacking was the potatoes that I love to add to my Zaba Bowl at Zabas. Was disappointed about that, but hey, not a deal breaker. Especially since I saw they had Coke Zero on tap! lol!\n\nAll in all this location seemed pretty nice and packed. The noise level was extremely high, but not nearly as obnoxious as Cafe Rio. Oh and that music either has to go or be turned down a tad. \n\nWould I eat here again? Yes, but have to be honest that I only ate here today because a friend was craving it and that will be the only time I'd eat here again - if I were with someone who wants it and I'm not the one driving. Great food, my vegetarian style bowl was rather tasty minus my potatoes but I prefer Zabas choices and atmosphere a lot more.
2 ||| The could serve nothing but their chicken wings and stay in business!  The food is good and you get a alot!  If it was just the entree's i would give 3 stars.  If it was the wings only, it's 5!!!
2 ||| I live near the Panera on rampart but try this location as I was in the area. Three stars because the staff was very sweet. I ordered a half and half. I didn't specify what type of cheese and my grilled cheese came with American that wasn't good quality.  The soup was lukewarm and that wouldn't have been so bad if my hot chocolate wasn't piping hot -not a good combination. I went in for Wi-Fi and before I ordered I asked if they had Wi-Fi. The girl that took my order asked another girl and she said \"yes\" they did. When I went to use the Wi-Fi it wouldn't work.  There are plenty of other places in the area with Wi-FI.  I needed to get online. After my meal I ended up parking near Starbucks- which is in the same shopping center-  and getting on their Wi-Fi.
4 ||| Really good Saiman.  My wife is from Hawaii and was craving some authentic Hawaiian food.  The saiman broth was flavorful.  The noodles were perfect.  The great thing about it, the noodles and broth were the star.  They did not overload it with stuff to mask the taste.  \n\nI had the cornbeef Hash with eggs and rice.  It was done as they do on the island.  It's comfort food for those who are familiar with Island style food.  Not gourmet Iron Chef Kitchen food.  Just plain, down home island style food that will remind  you how your grandma made it.
3 ||| Food was great as always but it took forever to get it!
4 ||| The best pizza in the great state of Arizona! Enough said
0 ||| They are more than happy to take your money. However, they are more than happy to ignore you when there is a problem. The WORST customer service I have ever encountered. When you spend 20,ooo + for new windows and 5000.00 for a new door you expect them to take care of problems. Would never recommend this company.
3 ||| Craving sushi? Then this is the place to go. It's well worth the drive to Mt. Lebanon. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the fish was flown in multiple times a day.  It's always so fresh. The sushi gets 5 stars.The staff is also incredible. The owner goes out of his way to walk around and check on tables. It is very clear that he wants every guest to have an enjoyable dining experience. However, if you are looking for great hibachi, look elsewhere. I've tried the hibachi chicken, steak and shrimp. I've never been that impressed. It's fairly standard for hibachi. I've definitely had better fried rice and miso soup. The hibachi gets 3 stars. Another issue when eating at Little Tokyo is getting a table. It seems like business is hit or miss.Some nights I have tried to get a table for 3 and had to wait 40 minutes. Last weekend, we were able to get a table for 6 without waiting. I suggest you call ahead if you have a large party.
4 ||| We had a long layover so we decided to take a taxi downtown. I'm not sure but I think the taxi driver took the long way there, 20 bucks from the airport seemed a bit much considering how close it was. \nBut as for Sam's cafe, we really enjoyed it. The chips and salsa was a good start, I like how the basket was an assortment of chips. They prepared the guacamole fresh in front of you too which was pretty cool. We both enjoyed the food. I had this skillet lasagna dish and my girl had a carnitas and something combo plate. The carnitas were a little dry for my liking though. They were a few items on the menu that looked really good too so if I'm ever in the area again I'll hopefully try them. \nOh, we took light rail back to the airport for $1.75 each and took us less time to get there. Just in case you're traveling like us.
1 ||| I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).\n\nI walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more \"attention grabbing\" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no.
0 ||| OK...'USED to BE' is the key word here.  I know I gave this place a high rating alst year...but NOW??? I used to Love this place and it had classy neighborhood people that  frequented it- from Paradise Valley, Arcadia areas... OMG! NOW? I There is an old geezer who's name starts with an H, who pretends to own the place,. He is  ALWAYS there.....and he invites tons of match dot com women to meet him there -in the bar lounge (that used to be awesome). He acts like he knows them all and play them like a fiddle- The Bar staff loves him because these poor women buy drinks and food...He makes sure to tell the women to get there before dinner so they buy BAR food...It is a gimmick. He also orchestrates jazz dancing in the courtyard...in which he is actually helping sell dance lessons pretty much and the Dance Instructor is a real creepy smelly guy! So,  I'd say this place is NOW a PIMP  place..because the manager and staff knows exactly that he is using the place as a pimp home for himself and since no one goes there much (May-Sept) he drives a little business to Royal Palm, making it look like a chick hang out...(Piano player is great) Bar tenders have their heads up there ass's (the fat one is rude) and the bar food gives you gas and taste like crap. This place is  not anything  like is used to be. Sad!
1 ||| Got together with Robyn N. & Mike C. today to give this place a try.  I had a Reuben Sandwich with Potato Salad for the included side.  The food was delicious and the sandwich included a generous portion of lean, tender Corned Beef.  The down side for me was the dining area.\n\nThis is a place where you order at the counter & then they bring the food to you.  That room had tables & chairs kind of right in the way, not to my liking at all.  Then over on the east side was an actual dining room, with booths as well as tables & chairs (good), but a really blah atmosphere, & light blaring in from the windows with no shades.\n\nAs much as they are charging for the food here, the dining room should have been nicer & more comfortable.  I'm more of a fan of both Chompie's & Scott's.\n\nGood sized Reuben Sandwich plus choice of potato salad, cole slaw or fries:  $10.99
4 ||| Amazing bakery and deli.  Eastern european cuisine.  Friendly and generous owners.  Highly recommend!
0 ||| I will never go back there for a pedi they do horrible french tips also my nail polish chipped 2 days later don't bother goin here for a french tip
2 ||| Good chicken salad, but wheat bread was ordinary.  Other sandwiches looked decent as well.
3 ||| I love how it's the only restaurant that is open 24 hours near Mt Lebanon\n\nIt's always good food, even after a night out at the bars.
0 ||| I see that I am not alone in receiving horrible customer service from WM.  I called to cancel my service and was told that I would receive a pro-rated refund for the 3 months of service I had to pre-pay per their billing requirements.  I used only 9 days of a 3 month billing cycle.  I was told it would take up to 6 weeks to receive my refund via snail mail.  Here I am 6 weeks later, no refund, so I call to follow-up.  The new person I talk to tells me that as of sept 1, no refunds are given for partial service cancellation...complete opposite of what I was told when I called to cancel.  (I cancelled on sept 4th....convenient timing for a change in policy).  Customer rep I am talking to of course cannot do anything to help, she attempts to find a manager to help, but nobody is around at 2pm in the middle of a workday.  I now have to wait 72 hours for somebody to call me back and hope that I am able to answer the phone when they do.  Terrible, terrible customer service, not to mention their outrageous prices and overage charges relative to Republic Services.  Save yourself the frustration and use Republic if you have the option.
1 ||| I love mexican food and I would want mexican food for lunch everyday if I can.  \nNow you can guess how excited I was when I found out that I had mexican restaurant right next where I work.  \n\nBut sadly enough this Macayo's mexican kitchen was not a real mexican restaurant.\nThey make McDonald version of Mexican food. \nI can tell that they use low quality meat, chiken etc. \nI am so sad that have to drive at least 5 minutes to get real mexican food.
1 ||| Hmmm...Im not sure what all the rave reviews are about...\nMy husband & I went to Vegas after he returned from a 9 month deployment.  Before our trip, I went online and searched for all the must-do & bargain deals that Vegas offered.  Luv-It Frozen Custard was recommended.  I'd have to say that even before our trip began, I was more looking forward to going to this place than going anywhere else because I LOVE frozen treats.  We couldn't go during the first two days but on the third, when my husband found out that there was a Star Trek convention at the Hilton Hotel, I waved goodbye to him and eagerly made my way to this place.  In my mind, I was going to get Cold Stones portion of the most savory custard and I wasn't going to have to share any of it with my husband...\nWell, when I rounded the corner to this place, I knew I might be in for a let down...just the ambiance of the surrounding neighborhood.  I actually missed the store and had to turn around.  \nWhen I finally got to the parking area, I was surprised because I thought it was a shop that I would be able to walk in to, see the various custards, and pick the one that I wanted.  Instead, I was faced with just a guy hanging his head out the window, asking me what I would like.  \nI ended up getting chocolate chip.  I was unimpressed.  I thought it would come in a cone but he gave me a scoop of it in a styrofoam cup.   The portions were so tiny!  The size...not what I imagined.  The taste...also not what I imagined.  It was like eating soft ice cream.  The price...EQUALLY unimpressive.  How can you call a scoop of ice cream for about $5(?) cheap?  \nI tell you, this place IS NOT a hidden gem.  It may be hidden but it's no gem.  You'll be better off getting your frozen treat from somewhere else like Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio.  You're spending about the same amount of money for more gelato, and you'll get to enjoy it at the Bellagio!  (((I love Bellagio...)))\nAfter the convention, my husband asked me if I wanted to go to Luv-It's now, not knowing that I went without him...I said NO! \nI'm telling you, save your money!  It's just not worth it!
1 ||| Let's be honest, in a place like this, you are paying for the view - and Isabella's delivers. \n\nFood was good, but nothing out of this world for such high prices (75 per person). My biggest complaint was the inconsistency in, well - everything. I went here with my girlfriend while we were strolling by. Again the view is amazing, and the owner was friendly, but the salmon was on par with the frozen stuff from the grocery store while the steak was very good (received rare instead of medium rare). Cheese plate with delicious cheese had seemingly random accompaniments, and the waitress forgot my beer. \n\nAll these things can be overlooked for a 20-30 dollar meal but not at 70-80 dollars per person. I recommend saving your money and going to Le Mont down the street for a better value.

0 ||| I tried to purchase a particular beer and I was told that they would not sell to me because I'm not a \"regular\". I would've very likely become one if I'd received any type of customer service at all. Unfortunately for this arrogant owner, he seems to believe that it's good business sense to alienate people for attempting to patronize his business. I will never, ever go back.
4 ||| Jason and Timothy came today to clean my ducts and discovered possible growth on the inside of furnace.  They  referred me for remediation to investigate the problem.  Thorough and professional.  Took time to explain the issue and how to proceed.  Also, went out of their way to reach my 2nd floor unit from the back.  Great, professional service!\n\nLast week I had the carpet cleaned and again, a great job.   Kudos to Charlotte Stanley Steemer!\n\nJEB
1 ||| Their food is pretty good, but I'm giving them two stars for their service. I know, chinese restaurants like these are not know for their service. But the servers here don't know anything about serving. This place automatically charges you 15% gratuity for a party of SIX! and the don't even deserve it. they'll actually write it down themselves on the check you're supposed to sign. I know there are no rules about giving tips but don't be afraid telling them that you intend to give less.
4 ||| Mr. K's is awesome!  Growing up in Charlotte on the south side, we always went here right after the dentist (weird, I know!).  It's always been a twice a year thing since we never really went to this side of town, but I've always enjoyed it.  \n\nLunch can be pretty crowded, but it still seems to move quickly.  Although finding a parking space can be a pain!  It's just a giant lot and people just park where they can.  \n\nBesides the basic burger and fries, they have my favorite kind of ice.  I know you don't go places for ice, but it's the really good crushed kind instead of giant cubes.  A huge plus in my book!
4 ||| I cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. The chips are to die for, the salads and tortilla soup were awesome. To top it off, the service by our waitress TJ (Tammy J) was excellent as she made us feel like guests in her own home. We'll go back again anytime we visit Phoenix.
4 ||| I go here once a year for a friend's birthday dinner (his chosen tradition). The food is very good with authentic choices for those actual Germans who accompany us on this pilgrimage. The service is friendly and attentive if a little unpredictable (you never know what type of beer the waitress who has apparently worked there for 25 years will bring you - ha!). Definitely worth a visit if you are in this area. The pepper steak with spaetzle is really delicious.
0 ||| WHYYYYY I am still hungry after eating here.....\n\nWaiter (Tall goofy kid, maybe the son?)  seemed very put off by having us there. was repeatedly rude to us and rolled his eyes several times (which is JUST about enough to make me commit homicide.)\n\nHe told us we needed to order because they \"had a lot of big parties coming soon\"\n we had a large party and too much food to grill at table, so we asked him (tall goofy son) to take two dishes back into kitchen, and he again groaned, rolled his eyes, and said \"I told you this would happen if you didn't order soon\"  WTF?\n\nplace was clean.  dishes were reasonable at about $10 each. food was bland but acceptable.  Once goofy son left us completely alone, ignoring us and placing us into refill-hell for about 20 minutes, we caught his attention and asked for extra plates to cut a birthday cake we brought..... he groaned and we never saw him again,  a younger son took over our table and service was excellent after that.\nwe won't be back. I'd rather be strapped to a board and be forced to stare directly into a One Direction concert than be treated like shit by a snot-nosed teenage Nickelback fan.  DIRRRRRR....
4 ||| This place has the best chicken wings in town. Hands down. Also the homemade potato chips are a must for when you come to watch whatever game you want. One of the waitresses, Brianna I think is her name, always greets with a cheshire smile and a cold budweiser!
3 ||| This location closed mid December 2011.  They have directed members to the LA Fitness at University & Stapley.  LA Fitness purchased a large number of Bally's, and are closing them/consolidating them to LA locations.
4 ||| Went on Mother's Day with wife and family.\nSteaks were average for the price. Very good service. Chocolate cake very good, but overpriced. Good middle level family steakhouse.
4 ||| I frequent Harris Grill quite often. Whenever we need a place in walking distance I always pick them over all the other high priced or mediocre Shadyside restaurant/bars. Their menu changes seasonally and is always hilarious (more so than Mad Mex, which they poke fun at along with other local restaurants). They're surprisingly vegetarian friendly for the amount of meat they have on their menu. I have not had anything here that wasn't delicious; favorites will come and go, but I'm a fan of their HUGE salads and the eggplant lasagna (noodle free). \n\nAbsolutely go for brunch - Sundays 10 to 2. It will either be a buffet or a menu for a fixed price of $13. VERY meat heavy, but I'm sure there is always something veggie-friendly, but never expect vegan-friendly. They include two drinks and a fresh fruit plate - one of the drinks can be a bloody mary (which we got and regretted, it was very unpalatable) or a frozen mimosa (get that instead). \n\nWhat I really love, aside from the fantastic food, is the creative cocktails. These drinks are going to be on the $8.50 side, some are worth it and some aren't, but The $3 Frozen Cosmo happy hour is the best deal on Ellsworth. Even if you're a manly man, this very pink booze slushie is amazing. Go with a big group and ask for the lounge upstairs or a window booth. Service is usually either chipper and delightful or just barely okay. We don't come here for the service or the dim lights - we go for a good meal and you should too.
4 ||| Busiest Chick Fil A in Charlotte? Maybe, but Beckie and her staff do a great job ushering everyone through with a smile and good service. Food is good, just like every other Chick Fil A and this location does a lot of the CHick Fil A promotion specials (i.e. free fry day, free spicy chicken biscuit, etc).
3 ||| I am not a coffee person, at all - still, I have to admit, this place has a nice feel to it and is so cheap that it's probably just a step or two below nirvana for coffee drinkers.\n\nTwo things make me remember a shop where I can't drink 99% of what's sold. One, the people who work here are really nice; I hadn't visited this shop in months and they still gave me a big hello when they saw my face again recently. Two, I can appreciate a nice set-up when I see one, too, and the entire shop is just filled to the brim with shelves and shelves of jars and more jars, each filled with another kind of coffee bean - needless to say, coffee lovers, give yourself time to browse!\n\nBut I already said I'm not a coffee person - so what in the world am I even doing in this place, you ask? Well, the shop also carries a couple candy and chocolate options, has a mini-fridge with cold beverages, and has a(n admittedly small, especially compared to the rest of the shop) selection of tea available behind the main register.\n\nI wouldn't say it's my favorite place in the world; my cup of tea seemed pretty weak compared to other places I've visited. \n\nStill, it was far, far cheaper than other places, so I guess I can honestly say I got what I paid for: nothing spectacular but nothing awful, either.
2 ||| Yes, better than Subway.  But have our bars really sunk that low?\n\nI hate writing negative reviews, but the sandwiches here are bland.  They might slice the meat and cheese in front of you, but the bread isn't exactly fresh.\n\nI was going to give it two stars, but then I remembered the cookies.  Yum.  Cookies.
1 ||| Some friends and I were staying at the Hilton Charlotte University Place just on the other side of the lake and walked over to Zapata's for dinner on a Saturday night, around 8 PM. The restaurant was busy, but there was an empty table right inside the back door. I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat.\n\nFast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.\n\nFood-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine. That said, if I was to end up back in this area, I doubt I'd return to this restaurant.
2 ||| Let me start by saying that the food isn't bad at all.  But, when you are asked to pay the amount that Morton's charging, then your standard is elevated.  For the price that I paid, I expect to be wowed, and sadly that wasn't the experience.  First, the staff and service was very adequate, not too intrusive, just the right balance, and they were friendly, we were asked by different staff members if everything was fine, which it was, but it wasn't great.  The meal consisted of a Morton Salad, Mashed Potatoes and an 8 oz Fillet Mignon.  The salad was large enough for 2 people, but  unfortunately, it was poor.  It was basically, Romaine Lettuce, chopped eggs and blue cheese dressing.  That's\"s it!  Not  tomatoes, no cucumbers, no onions,  not even lowly croutons.  Tasty, but very average.  The mashed potatoes were good, tasty,  had a slight taste of sour cream and chives. Not bad.  The steak, the entire reason I'm here.  It was not bad.  I ordered medium rare, the marinade seemed a little a sweet for my taste, and I want to say, might have a hint of teriyaki, but I'm not a 100 percent certain.  Not my favorite combination, but it wasn't horrible either.  When I pay 40 plus dollars for a piece of steak, I expect it to be so tender, that the knife goes through it without much resistance.  The first couple bites were almost perfect, but the more I got to the center of  it, the chewier and tougher the steak got.  This steak should be tender throughout.  That was the most disappointing.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but based on other similar steakhouses that I've eaten at, this should have been better.
3 ||| It may be not one thing different except the blue color but I found the new signage confusing this morning at an airport I'm well familiar with.  Mind you it was 5:30 A.M. and at that hour I find much of the world confusing.   Good dining options abound, varying from terminal to terminal. Having to board shuttle bus rather than some sleek automated rail between terminals seems a bit of a throwback, but all in all, it's big, clean, attractive, a bit spread out, a pleasant place to fly to and through and easily accessible (and quick trip) from Central Phoenix.
0 ||| By far the worst McDonald's in the world.  Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct.  Ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity.  I've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my Big Mac.  Save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here.
4 ||| I'm a huge fan of this place.  It's an actual sports bar, in a part of town choking to death on crappy franchise restaurants.  Expect efficient, friendly staff, seriously good pizza and wings, and good drink specials.  It's a busy bar, so if you're looking for a sub-2 minute greet on a Friday night, go to Chili's.  The service at Picasso's is good, but it's not A) a family restaurant, B) a frozen drink/flair/appletini bar, or C) a 'College' bar.  It's a sports bar, so tip well, enjoy the food, and get ready for the bartenders to know your name and your drink the next time you come in.
4 ||| Fast Signs were so accomodating and very quick each time I needed to order something. Within hours, I received an estimate and the customer service was top notch! Ask for Karen! She is the best!! Thank You Fast Signs for helping to get my new business going as quickly as you did!!
3 ||| I'm so conflicted! On one hand, we were able to get seated in under five minutes of arriving. On the other hand, the food didn't sing to me, but rather just hummed along to a common theme. \n\nEvidently, not drinking alcohol has either effected my taste buds or my perception of food, because I cannot honestly say I was impressed with last night's meal. The Boom Dip appetizer was okay, after adding red pepper flakes. But the Alfredo The Dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me. Was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta? The cheese wasn't melted, and I couldn't find any alfredo sauce in my pasta bowl. Par for the course, I ended up getting full and bringing about half of the dish home. If, at lunch, I decide this was a good meal and I was just misguided by not having alcohol with my food, I shall update my review.
0 ||| UGH. I don't know why Pittsburgh has allowed Giant Eagle to basically have a monopoly on groceries in this city. Yeah, sure, we have some smaller niche grocers and a few low-cost players that have moved into town recently, but let's face it -- in the all-encompassing big supermarket space, there really is no true competition. The market pretty much belongs to Giant Eagle. What I wouldn't give for Wegman's to expand into the Burgh...but I digress.\n\nLimited competition means that Giant Eagle stores can be consistently subpar and people will shop there anyway. Ok, so to be fair, this Giant Eagle isn't among the worst locations as far as Giant Eagles are concerned -- the South Side and Squirrel Hill locations that I used to frequent take that honor. So I'll give this location an extra star for not being the suckiest of a sucky chain of stores. But even this supposed 'nicer' Giant Eagle still doesn't cut it in the grand scheme of supermarkets.\n\nMy main beefs? First and foremost (and this applies to all GEagles) -- the prices. The prices are downright insulting. Yeah, yeah, sometimes they have sales (oh boy, how nice of them!), which take their sky-high prices and bring them down to what most other grocery stores would charge on a normal day. So I hope that your shopping list contains nothing but items on \"sale,\" because otherwise you're out of luck. \n\nSecond, this location seems to consistently be out of stock of basic items every time I come in here. Just yesterday I went in for two things -- baby spinach and sandwich wraps. Two things. And BOTH items were out of stock. I'm sorry, I know that it's the weekend and it's busy, but how about you try to keep up with demand? Is that too much to ask? This is not the first time I've gone in for just a few items and have left without them because the shelves were empty. For a store the size of Giant Eagle, I expect more.\n\nThird, I've personally had issues with meat quality here. Specifically, I've found their Nature's Basket chicken breast to be consistently tough and stringy -- almost inedible. The first time, I thought maybe I just got a bad batch. The second time, I started to get suspicious about the quality. And the third time (several weeks later) when it still had the nasty texture issues, I vowed to never buy chicken there again (and I haven't). As a dubious ex-president once said, \"Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\"\n\nLastly, I've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location. For example, the latest instance came about a month ago. When we went to check out, my hubby put his basket on the conveyor belt without emptying it. Now I used to work at a grocery store when I was a teenager, and I would get frustrated when people were too lazy to put their items on the belt. It's annoying, I get it. I really do. But my hubby didn't know any better. And when this would happen to me as a cashier (which was often), I would smile and take the items out of the basket one by one and scan them (albeit secretly cursing the customer in my head). But Kayla, our cashier? She gave a pissed-off sigh, rolled her eyes....and then literally took the basket, held it pointedly up about a foot or two over the belt, and deliberately dumped it upside down so everything came crashing down at once. We had some fragile things in there (strawberries, blueberries, and eggs) that were damaged from the impact. Completely unacceptable!\n\nSigh. I have countless additional stories about how awful Giant Eagle is, but my fingers are getting tired, and if Yelp doesn't already have a word limit, they would probably consider putting one into place if I keep going.  :)  \n\nOk, one last thing, and then I'm outta here, I swear. They are currently renovating this location to be a Market District (slated to open in early 2015), so we can all look forward to that. Sorry, GEagle, but you ain't foolin' anyone -- you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. \n\nAll right, now I'm really done.  :)
4 ||| Love Goldie's we always have a wonderful time and great service. They have great weekday deals and their Goldieritas can't be beat! Wouldn't go anywhere else to get my sports fix and great food.
2 ||| My steak was cooked as ordered. Service was attentive but not overbearing. The food was fine. Still, when my bourbon was $13 and no steak was under $30, I expected more. I am in town on business. When I spend $100 on dinner for two, Morton's would blow these guys away. I can't complain- it was really nice but not worth the expense. For the money, you could go better. But since this is my first visit to Madison, I don't know what else this town has to offer
4 ||| My friend Leung's uncle own this place and that is not the reason I am biased! It is good food. It is small restaurant but they are fast!
2 ||| I have eaten here on several occasions for lunch, and I have mixed reviews about the place.  It's not horrible, but its not the greatest either.\n\nFor starters, they are tucked away in a really weird spot.  Its in the ASU center, and if you did not know it was there, I really don't know how you would find it.  It's also a rather small location, so there is actually no seating inside the place.  All you can really do is place an order, and take it to go.\n\nThe few times I have been in there, the service has been pleasant, but not great.  There is a guy who has waited on me before, and I believe he is either the owner, or a manager.  He's friendly and nice, but always involved in a conversation with someone else.  It seemed like the people that he was talking to were his friends, and I had to wait for him to finish talking to them before I could get any service.  Plus, its not like hes neccesarily \"waiting\" on them.  He's \"shooting the breeze\" so to say.  Can you say annoying?  Im on lunch hour here people, I don't have time to play games.  I just want to eat my lunch and be done with it, ya know?\n\nAnyways, they seem to have a decent menu of items, but the prices are ridiculously expensive.  I can't believe how much this guy charges for his sandwiches.  like $7 for a cheapo sandwich.  The food is good, and the portions are good, but I just find that its not worth the $7-$10 at all...plus you have no seating, and you ignore me when I come in?  yyyeeeaaa.
4 ||| I've been eating here for about 12 years now and I keep going back. My wife and I, while dating in high school, went here every Friday night for a few years straight.\n\nThe pizza's are all very good whether you order something from their \"speciality\" menu or build one yourself. Their \"Italian dinners\" aren't quite as good and seem to take a backseat to their pizza in many regards.\n\nThe food feels like it's got some roots. A lot of the flavors taste homemade and seem like they've been around for a while, passed down from some previous generation.\n\nThey've got a good beer selection, on draft or bottled too, lots of good choices to go with their pizza. I haven't tried their wine or any mixed drinks.\n\nFinally, they seem to have a pretty consistent group of waiters and managers. The guy who was the busboy when I was going there in high school is now the manager and we see a lot of the same waitresses who come back on a seasonal basis, so that says something about how the place is run, seems very family oriented.
2 ||| A fast casual Chinese concept that seems a little less chain-ish than Pei Wei... My friend Allyson B introduced me to this place.  I love that it's around the corner from the dog park - it's perfect because I can take Minnie to the dog park to play and call my order in as I'm leaving and it's usually ready when i arrive.\n\nI've been a handful of times and always done take-out.  It's really not the type of place you want to stay and hang out.  There is no atmosphere and it's located in a strip-mall.  Since the tag line is \"A Healthy Food Bistro,\" I feel like it's healthier for me than other Chinese in the valley... but I think that's just in my head!  Still, I tell them 'light oil' whenever I order.  I feel less guilty that way!\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the protein options.  First time around, I ordered shrimp with veggies - the shrimp did not taste fresh so I picked around it and ate the veggies and brown rice.  I went with chicken the next few times, and when I saw that they have eggplant (my fave) on the menu, I started requesting a combo of eggplant, mixed veggies, and chicken. Still, the chicken tastes almost processed - Once again, I eat the veggies and rice.  Maybe the key is to order beef or tofu... I'll keep trying until I get it right, or maybe I'll just have to find an alternative.  \n\nEither way, China Lite gets 3 stars from me.  If you go, get the eggplant - that's the only item I can really recommend!
1 ||| I visited the Vision Center at this location to have an eye exam.\n\nThe staff was a bit disorganized. There are a few front-facing people who handle people who are checking out or buying glasses. I had to interrupt one of them, since there was no indication of what to do to check in for an appointment. That lady was irritated that no one in the back was helping people to their appointments. In the back, there were two assistants (a.k.a. high school students) that helped with appointment paper work and the basic eye tests that come before every eye exam. I had to do one of the tests over, because the assistant didn't tell me that I had to take out my contacts. She was more interested in going out to lunch with her friend. She actually booked out of the place after improperly administering the tests and the other assistant had to help me. The optometrist was irritated that the assistants could not properly administer the tests. \n\nThe facility is definitely what you would expect of a doctor's office set up in a Walmart. It had only basic equipment and was pretty plain, though it seemed at least decently clean. \n\nThe good thing about the process was that it was pretty fast and simple. They didn't have me sitting around for an hour like most medical offices. The tests and visit with the doctor were the same as I've had elsewhere. Unfortunately, the price was the same as any eye exam I've had at about $75 (additional $20 fee if you want your pupils dilated). It would be nice to save more than time considering the staff and facilities are not up to par with typical offices.\n\nAnother good thing is that Walmart is partnered with 1800contacts. This makes it easy to send in your prescription and order contacts online. I do recommend buying your contacts from 1800contacts, since they are typically about 50% the price of buying them in person at the optometrist's office.
2 ||| Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.\n\nFor dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).\n\nPino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  My friend and I were the only males there.  If cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in Pino's jungle safari!
3 ||| A nice little Asian store that has a bunch of Asian stuff for those wanting to have some Asian flavor in their life. I was able to find the green tea that I was craving here.
1 ||| All I can is MEH.  For the price point, I thinking the food to die for.  But I can't express how average it was for me.  First, the place was deserted, like two other parties in the whole joint. Huh....interesting. \n\nWe went to Morton's to celebrate a friends birthday. They did it right with personalized menus and confetti on the table.  Hands down it was awesome. The gesture is pretty awesome since most places don't come close to that.  \n\nI ordered a salad and the filet mignon tacos. I was that hungry.  The salad was cool.  The tacos you get more of everything else but filet, and should be called tacos of condiments hahahaha. The filet looked like beef jerk or barbacoa.  For me the best was the berries and cream.  Absolutely amazing!  \n\nJust overall not impressed with the price and selection.  Maybe I partial to my favorites.
4 ||| I love this place.  There was a time when I ate here twice a week.  The food is amazing and very true to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home, Southern cuisine.  Everything is fresh, delicious, and remarkably low-priced.
0 ||| Sure enough Just like the other reviewers said, they will try to over charge for everything and upgrade you the insurance without your approval. Read your contract before you agree to it. Thieves!
4 ||| I hate bad haircuts so much that I refuse to get my hair cut for months after I move to a new city.  I finally broke down after almost a year of not cutting my hair.  I had a wedding to go to and did not want to look like a cave dweller. \n\nI walked into Veraldi on an impulse, and ran smack into Susan, the owner.  She was on her way out, as they were closing for the day.  All of the sudden, though I'd waited months to consider a haircut, I felt panicked.  I begged her to stay another few minutes, promising her that my hair would be so easy and so quick to cut.  \n\nIt wasn't.\n\nAfter she agreed to stay to cut my hair, she continued working on it for the next half hour.  It needed major help, and we both knew it.  I winced as she finished, wondering what the damage would be, and then nearly hugged her when she told me.  I walked out of Veraldi having only paid 35 dollars (student discount off of 38!) for one of the best haircuts of my life.\n\nI looked so fabulous at the wedding.  Susan, you are a genius and a lifesaver, and I'm NEVER going to anyone else in this city.
4 ||| Great tasting food all made  from scratch and you can literary taste the love and care that goes into each dish.
4 ||| Speedy quick delivery. Able to order completely on the iPad. Good Chinese comfort food for a sick patient in the hospital.
3 ||| Im really torn on this one....they do a fantastic job....and one of the few places in the valley that will polish white golf shoes....here is my issue....took multiple shoes including golf shoes there about once a month for 6-7 months....i was in a huge hurry when i picked them up and wasn't paying attention....they normally charged $8 a pair for regular shoes and around $10 for golf shoes,...they charged me $50 for 2 pair of golf shoes....i was shocked....i should have called and complained but I'm more the type to just go elsewhere....which admittedly is dumb on my part because they did do a great job polishing my shoes.
1 ||| i dunno man. \n\nthis place is practically walking distance from my house, but for some reason i've never made it here.  after reading all the good reviews, i figured i'd drive through for some late snacks. \n\nfirst, the woman working the drive through didn't speak any english, so it took an unnecessarily long time to order.  \n\nnext, i only ordered two things-a california burrito and a horchata. i paid with a card and she's didn't say how much the food was when i gave it to her.  when i got home i looked at the receipt and saw i was charged SIXTEEN DOLLARS for these two items! i didn't look at the cost of the burrito, but i did notice a large horchata was something like $3 on their menu.  no way that burrito could have cost $13, so i must have been charged for two. ugh! \n\nafter reading all the reviews about how ~amazing~ their aqua frescas are, i could not believe how awful the horchata was.  it was extremely watery and obviously made with a powder mix as i could taste the graininess in the drink.  the actual flavor was very weird as well, it didn't taste like any horchata i've ever had (and i've had a lot). \n\nthe california burrito was the saving grace and was actually really delicious.  unfortunately since the rest of the experience was so annoying and i was overcharged, i think i'm going to stick with bertos or vaquero for my late night fat snacks.
2 ||| OK, it's not as bad as all of these reviews are making it out to be. In fact I hear they have a lovely brunch which is somewhat famous. However, I did order the steak and lobster and was still hungry when I had cleaned my plate. And I am a pretty small girl. The salads were good, hubby's osso bucco was great, but honestly if I order the most expensive damn thing on the menu, I expect to leave full which I did not. Best Cosmo I've ever had. We would probably go back except now that I have seen all of these reviews I am afraid we just got lucky.... or they expected that we'd be big tippers.
2 ||| Not even close to the Original Floridinos (the one on Alma school and chandler).   To be honest, the only reason we go to this place out is to tease our taste buds, and save some gas being in Gilbert and all.  Food and meh at best, and a little pricey.  We just need more itailian restaurent in Gilbert,
1 ||| Not only does this place smells, but also I went and got a couple of sides on a small bowl I mean just a little bit ( no entrees just plain fried rice on a bowl)  for my sons lunch they charged me $5 bucks. ( not being a cheapy but I thought that was a lot for a couple so scoops without an entree.).The Panda Express on stephanie is the way to go. Super clean and have wonderful people working there. Sigh! I have been having a bad experience on all the businesses in this plaza except for the great  dog grooming place next door! Yayyyy! Go for real Chinese food! :)
4 ||| Love the location of this Cosco, really clean, nice store, Overall really good experience here compared to mine in Ohio, \n\nDownside, the lines are usually pretty long, especially when picking up contacts. They must have a busy optical department. \n\nWorkers are extremely friendly though!
0 ||| The epitome of a crap chain.  Why did I get talked into going here?  Because I am a tool.  Crowded, loud, mediocre food, slow service, and on this particular occasion a strange man two tables down and across the aisle staring at me and not his dining companion, during the entire meal.  I should have just yelled, \"watch my head spin\" and vomited there at the table.
3 ||| Been here enough including several times since I started reviewing on yelp but have held back...today, I'm busting it out.\n\nI have a lifetime of eating in various Jewish deli's in Chicago, Florida and Arizona and Scott's is typical, not exceptional but certainly a restaurant where food is decent, portions are excessive and pricing is never a bargain.\n\nSo I have no particular gripes and I would recommend the place to others who are looking for good chicken noodle/matzah ball soup or a massive corned beef or pastrami sandwich. For this you cannot go wrong here.
0 ||| Sooo blacked out here that\nWe heckled the guitarist.\nNot sorry. He sucked.
0 ||| It is much overpriced, and in my opinion the flavor and texture of the food was similar to what I would expect from any drive thru 'berto establishment. I don't mind that type of food when I'm paying 4 dollars and expecting to throw away a bunch of styrofoam.  But 40 dollars for two people for lunch and one drink each was money that could have been spent buying taco bell and a six pack of bottled margaritas, with money leftover for a tank of gas.  The layout of the establishment is also really weird. (And I'm coming to notice that I have an issue with weirdly laid out restaurants, but I digress.)  You're practically knocking people's food over to get to a table in the back. But this isn't a place you'd want that kind of attention.  This place gets a star for the drink being huge (and for the price, it should be) and giving me a cool buzz on a Saturday afternoon.
0 ||| We went here for lunch the other day.  It was busy, and seemed like a lot of business people came here for lunch. I took that as a good sign, since they chose to come to Portofino's over several good options pretty close by.  Unfortunately, I don't agree with their choice.  Our waiter was friendly enough, kind of a low talker, but otherwise the service was fine. We had the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for an appetizer.  It was good, though I would have real issues with a restaurant that could mess THAT up.  For lunch, I ordered the Ravioli special, my husband had a chicken parmesan sub and my mom-in-law had a salad with salmon and their house dressing.  \n\nMy meal bordered on gross.  It looked like they had taken all of the different ravioli left over from dinner the night before, put them on a plate, then smothered them in a creamy basil sauce with way too many olives and roasted red peppers, so that they were unrecognizable.  There was way too much going on on that plate.  I like all of the things separately, but together, none of the flavors were distinguishable when it was all together.  There were heart-shaped mushroom ravioli, huge round meat-pie ravioli, smaller round cheese ravioli, and square sausage ravioli.  Doesn't that sound like whatever they had left over was what went on the plate?  The sauce was really gross looking: vomit-like in color and texture.  \n\nThe salad looked fresh, and got reviews of \"good.\"  Jim's sandwich was good as well, though he said he would get something else next time.  The table next to us ordered pizza, which looked good.  I'll probably try that if we go back.\n\nThe other thing about Portofino's that I didn't like, was the noise level.  Normally in a restaurant, even a busy one, I can concentrate on our conversation and not hear others (unless I was trying :) ).  But this was a very loud lunchtime service, so I wouldn't recommend going there for a business meeting that you would like to pay attention to, or an intimate lunchtime date.
1 ||| Can't say I agree with the \"authentic\" claims that other people have made for this place.  While it has some of the more palatable Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh so far, it was not a meal that I felt satisfied the unbearable ache I've been feeling in my stomach for good Chinese food that I've had since moving here from California.\n\nFor one thing, no authentic Taiwanese breakfast.  \n\nFor another thing, ma po tofu, in my recollection, involves not only tofu but also minced pork.  We got some tofu floating in a sea of thick sauce that was... not... ma po... tofu...\n\nCurry over rice was pretty good.  Again, I'm not saying that place is bad.  But seriously folks.  This isn't authentic Chinese food.
1 ||| Spent 5 hours at the pool with friends. 3pm till 8:pm. I  was not impressed. It was dirty and unkept. Trash blowing all over cups and garbage in the pool. Towels on chairs all over with no people using them. The outside pool bar closed at 7:. Food was ok winged were meh, fried pickles had little flavor (but moist), Curley fries were soggy. Drinks weren't bad, $10 for red bull vodka isn't horrible.
0 ||| Don't come here for pizza. I looked at reviews to find a pizza place in Casa Grande to get a slice or personal pizza and thought that this place wouldn't be bad based on reviews. I was wrong.\n\nI ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza barely had any cheese on it in the first place, but neither the sausage nor the mushrooms were actually baked INTO the pizza. It was obvious that they had pre-made cheese slices that they warmed up on the stove top and just sprinkled the ingredients on. The crust was a decent thin crust, but the mushrooms were greasy and rubbery, the taste of the sausage was indescribable and gross (seriously, if you insist on getting pizza here, don't get the sausage).
4 ||| For a moment I didn't feel as though I was still in Vegas... What an awesome little place! We sat at the bar and watched the chefs make the meals. That was fun! They also have an area where shoes aren't allowed! The atmosphere was fast paced and loud and I loved it. \n\nWe ordered a sushi roll, a yellow tail tar tar, and beef tataki. All were absolutely fresh and phenomenal. \n\nWe had a bottle of sake as well. It was super yummy! \n\nI Can't wait to go back!
4 ||| I am from Chicago & I must say the book gallery compared to others I have seen back home really is amazing. The owner was incredibly nice. \nWhen I walked in I was in awe of all the old books many still on great condition. As an avid book lover this store stole my hearts \n\nThis store has a wide range of mystery, sci-fi, literature, children's books, occult, religious, jane austen, classic, westerns, archeology  & Egyptians which was my favorite sections. Only thing this store doesn't carry is romance, which my mom was looking for but wasn't able to get. \n\nNext time I am in town, I will make sure to stop by the book gallery.
2 ||| Girasole is a small Italian restaurant off Walnut Street that serves up decent Italian food.  I've only been to Girasole during dinnertime, with my last visit being last night.  Most patrons appear to be late 20's/early 30's to older patrons in the late 40's/early 50's as well as some college students here and there.  The restaurant itself is pretty cramped and ridiculously loud.  Tables are close together and patrons are all basically shouting to talk to each other or awkwardly sitting in silence.  I'm a loud guy who's at college and loud noises typically don't bother me, but something about the acoustics of the room... noises just bounce around instead of getting absorbed and the metal tables don't help either.  Anyways, on with the food.\n\nTheir menu is seasonal with slight changes in their pasta throughout the year.  Everyday they have a fresh poultry, a fresh fish, and a fresh meat of the day.  Their fresh fish was a grilled mako shark, but alas they were out for the night already (we got there before 6:30 PM).  All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad.  I ended up ordering their house ribeye medium rare along with a cup of their wedding soup.\n\nWhile we waited, we munched on bread from their bread basket.  Butter comes with the bread, but they also have balsamic and olive oil at each table too.\n\nThe wedding soup was pretty good; it wasn't overly salty and there was a reasonably amount of sausage.  I picked soup over their salad because my past experience with their salads are that they are swimming in dressing and I don't like my salads soggy.\n\nThe ribeye came topped with a pesto, diced tomatoes and served with roasted potatoes.  It was cooked to medium as opposed to medium rare, but for a steak under $30 bucks I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.  The pesto was flavorful but the roasted potatoes were a bit overcooked.  The steak itself had a beautiful char and cooked well as a medium steak.\n\nI've had their pasta in the past and they're of pretty good quality and cooked perfectly, but the portions have gotten smaller over time and I don't think the $3-5 dollar upcharge from the lunch menu is really worth it for dinner anymore.\n\nI would probably recommend Lydia's over Girasole, but it might be worth a shot for lunch when it won't be as loud and there probably wouldn't be a wait either.
2 ||| I found Pasqual's to be...average in nearly every way. Not bad, not excellent, just somewhere in the middle. \n\nFood was OK, portions were big but the flavor was missing something. I had a burrito with the bean mash and it reminded me of the frozen mushy stuff in the frozen microwave burritos. Chips were good though, did enjoy those before the meal and my margarita was nicely made.\n\nThe atmosphere doesn't factor into my review because I was seated next to a couple children who sounded like a cow trying to chew through a concrete block and being noisy little buttheads. I hate being sat next to children but if I choose to go to a restaurant that's kid-friendly there's really no choice but to deal with it (and I know full good and well the staff are expressly forbidden from saying something to obnoxious kids or their equally obnoxious parents.) One of these obnoxious uncontrolled children ran into a server with a full tray of food and was knocked over...I'll admit that made me happy.\n\nI wouldn't say no to a return trip here if somebody suggested it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it either. The food is OK, drinks are good, but it doesn't really stick out in my mind as a place to frequent.
3 ||| I enjoyed our meal here. I'm a big fan of the teppanyaki experience, and wasn't disappointed. It was a little pricier than I expected, but not TOO outrageous. The chef was talented, and our food was tasty. I might try some other places like this, just to compare, but we'll probably be back.
2 ||| way too expensive.  i bought my 8 weave leather couch here.  my wooden desk, my 50\" tv and my 2 end tables here.  it was across the street from where i lived, tho.  service was nice.  Alot of people in line for returns and delivery stuff.  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE PRICE.  and i bought my comfy desk jaguar chair here
3 ||| I have lived here since 09 in two different apartments.  The first one by the park and the second by the desert preserve.  The bottom line is this, if you have kids you will want to live as close to the park as possible so the kids have a place to play and so you can keep an eye on them.  If you don't have kids the best place to live is in an apartment facing the preserve or if your patio faces the preserve that's even better.  These apartments tend to be a little more quiet.  Overall the office staff is very nice and helpful and the apartments are clean.  The biggest negative about the apartments is parking.  If you have guests or a second car there is simply no place to park unless you like walking.
0 ||| Had a few bad experiences unfortunately in just one visit. The associates had no intention on being courteous, they even seemed to run away or roll their eyes to avoid me. I had to walk to the cashier to ask for help,  she willingly helped me,  answered my questions.  When I was about to walk out, the alarm went off and I was NOT even close to the door, one of the associates quickly pointed me out,  and loudly said \"Can you come here I gotta check if their is anything in THERE\"  meaning my bag.  He gave me his back the whole time, and didn't even look at me to say I was good to go. He just said your fine. That's it. So rude.
1 ||| Just another mediocre chain restaurant..
2 ||| The pizza would be a 3 star in my pizza rankings, but the friendly staff, great prices, and homey atmosphere earn this place a star bump. I was pretty disappointed in my lunch special pizza. I've been to NYC quite a bit, eaten a LOT of NY pizza and folks this aint it ! I did love the family vibe, and they treated me so well - I just wish the pizza was better. It was like warmed over mall food court type stuff. It *does* remind me of the food court pizzas I've eaten while in the city (Villa pizza in NYC comes to mind), but nothing special. I need to make it over there again beacuse clearly I caught them on a bad day, but unfortunately it's been a month and I still can't bring myself to go back !
0 ||| Worst counter service I've ever had...anywhere and for anything.  I rented a luxury car 2 months ahead of time. After reading reviews warning against budget carriers, I booked with Hertz ... thinking that paying for the name would be worth it.  I arrived exactly when I said I would and they told me (rudely) that I would need to wait 45 minutes for my car. So I watch these two idiots with attitudes make fun of customers, check out every woman who came near the counter and display the worst customer service I've ever seen. When I finally did get my car, they tried to put me in a Toyota Camry at the same price of a Cadillac.  He CHANGED my car type to a multi-level downgrade withour even saying anything!  So, he was going to try to just slip me into a different car at the same premium price on a two month old reservation...after waiting 40 minutes.\n\nThere was one shining star in this experience.  Liz (or Lisa?) in the loading area saw our distress and made it right.  She was wonderful.  The two losers at the counter should be fired. I wish I took the names so I could put them on here.   Liz (or Lisa?) should be running the place.\n\nStay away... at least until someone gets rid of the meatheads at the counter.
3 ||| My 101 review and the first for the new year!  I love this place I love it so much I kind of hate it at the same time.  \n\nI do not get to come here often so it is a guilty pleasure of mine to indulge and go a bit overboard.  \n1.  Nigori, a must have in my house.  It is an unfiltered Sake' a sweet wine.  It is unfiltered it is cloudy from being unfiltered and oh so good an amazing a sweet blend with the rice and alcohol good cup of adult bliss.\n2.  Yellow Tail Tartar a good staple of this place.  Always good and consistent.\n3.  Black Cod Miso a second must have for me!  Soft buttery flavor that never quits!\n4.  Takana fried rice a 3rd must have for me.  Stir fried rice with pickled veggies =you unknowing people trust me and give it a try! \n5.  Uni!  Well, you love it or you hate it I love it here the most!\n6.  Onigiri an awesome reminder of our trip to Tokyo.  It is wrapped rice (like Sushi) only with good stuff hidden inside like pork,salmon, act...\n7.  A few random skewers like gizzard (not my fave 8/) Chicken meat balls, Mmmm...\n8.  Beef carpaccio another if I can have it I am getting it item!\n9.  We also got a special it was yellow tail, quail egg and avocado.  I theory sounds great in reality it is not.  To many flavors that blend together and mix all the same texture and nothing that gives it a pop.  In all actuality would drop a star for this one BAD dish but they don't deserve it.  Just not a WIN on my part...\n\nI love this place one of my favorites to take guests to while visiting.  However there is now a creepy old guy in front as mentioned before.  I believe he is running things but it makes the guests and the employees nervous I would prefer he would leave and we could go back to the money making fun from the past.\n\nIf you are new here ask your waitresses (that is how we found a lot of out favorites and don't be afraid to try the stuff on the walls it is the best stuff!) they will help you order or look around the room and see what others are ordering and say \"I want to try that, what is it?!\"  We had a couple across from us and I kept hearing them say \"wow, that looks good! We should just get what they get.\"  I felt flattered by that one.  Thanks Guys! :)\n\nAnyways thanks for being my 101 and first for the year to make it a good one!
2 ||| bought shoes and then exchanged them for diff ones.  pro tip:  clean them before you exchange them.  it'll save you a lot of hassle.
2 ||| I stopped by this Goodwill located on Southern Ave and Stewart on 9/23/2011 to donate some items and discovered that it was closed. They moved to 1046 S Country Club Dr. (480-844-0906). The new location is next to Bookman's on the NW corner of Southern Ave and Country Club Dr.
4 ||| Excellent service - fun atmosphere. And the pizza is about as close I've had to NY style as I've had outside of NY.  Wish I didn't live 800 miles away.
4 ||| I can't believe this place has not been reviewed yet.  If you live in beechview you already know about this place, but if you don't you need to try this place out if you are passing through.\n\nAt first glance, you will barely notice the bar/restaurant from the exterior.  Inside it is your typical Pittsburgh bar with a some additional seating in the back.  So you would think, why take the time to review this place.  Well they have a old-fashion popcorn machine which they offer free while you are drinking at the bar and this popcorn was phenomenal.  But it only gets better, happy hour pints for 90 cents.  So, delicious popcorn + beer= Great afternoon after work.  Well at this point, I was like wow, this little place well served its purpose for a cheap happy hour on my way home from work. \n\nAnd then: The Reuben.  Now I am not the connoisseur of Reubens but, this one was absolutely flavorful.\n\nAll in All- check this place out if you are in the area and need to grab a cold one.
4 ||| This is another one of our staples when we come to Vegas. After many Western meals in the hotel, we always need to venture off the strip and pick up some Ca Kho To and Canh Chua Ca. Put simply, it's just good food. They're open 24 hours and the Pho is pretty tasty too. We've been eating here with our family for years.
2 ||| OK not great.  Nothing that significant to say that was bad about the experience, but comparatively not as great as other orchards (e.g. Door Creek).
4 ||| I know it gets a lot of bad reviews, but since I've been going to this place since I was a kid, and sweet and sour pork is my favorite \"Chinese\" dish, I'm giving it 5 stars. I remember as a kid, all of the Chinese food buffets had a thin sweet and sour sauce on crispy bits of breaded fried pork, but every other buffet I go to now has a very thick, overly sweet sauce. It's not a desert, it shouldn't be so sweet, and Golden Coin has been making this dish the same for so long, it's an absolutely perfect blend of sweet and sour. No they don't have a big selection, but it's better to make a few great items than to make 1000 mediocre items.
2 ||| Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.  Is there REALLY even a Leonard that works there?  Leonard goes to work and then takes an 8 hour break.  I called Staples to follow up on a print order and he told me he was going to have to call me back because it was time for his break.  I then went to the store and ole Leonard was too busy on his cell phone to help me.  The only upside to this place is the nice female that works in the copy/print center.
1 ||| My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question.
3 ||| Top Notch Cardiovascular Care Here! A wonderful aspect of BBHH is the comfortable and spacious visitor waiting areas with coffee, TV and helpful volunteers. The gift shop on the main level is well stocked and if you are lucky, one of the volunteers will be playing the baby grand piano in the lobby! The cafe here is not that great, but for a short walk, you can enjoy the amazing cafeteria at BBMC which is adjacent to BBHH. Also, Dairy Queen and Starbuck's are across the street.
3 ||| OK, how do I put this best?\n\nI don't go to Taco Bell for Mexican food. I don't go to Subway for a gourmet sandwich.\n\nI don't go to Pete's for pub-worthy fish and chips.\n I go to Pete's because of what it is; cheap, easy and good for what it is. The fish is nowhere near as greasy as many places I have seen it - the bag isn't soaked through by the time I bring it back to work - a huge plus! The sauce is the true star for me, addicting indeed. \n\nLike I say, don't go in expecting a gourmet meal of fish and chips, dip everything in sauce, and perhaps you'll be addicted as well!
3 ||| My review might be a little biased because I'm sitting in Inside the Bungalow on a beautiful Tuesday afternoon in May.  There are maybe 4 people here so naturally it's nice and quiet.\n\nI used to come to Coffee Talk all the time when I was a pretentious high school student.  I recently moved back to the East Valley after a 6-year hiatus and I'm trying to find great new spots to rival the places I loved in the other places I've lived.  Inside the Bungalow is definitely an oldie but a goodie.\n\nGreat prices! I'm a bargain hunter and the drink prices are excellent.  This place has a ton of ambiance... Very funky and comfortable.  I just got an iced black tea for $2.16 (+free refills) and it's delicious. It doesn't taste like a normal black tea but has more of a peach flavor to it with no need for sugar.\n\nThey also have a great outdoor space and FREE wi-fi.  The only downside is they have a $4 minimum on credit/debit.\n\nI can't wait to come back to have lunch and try some of their coffee.  Their food prices are a bit pricey for me but considering how impressed by my drink I am, I think it will definitely be worth $8 for a sandwich.
4 ||| Lovely, Calm, Restful brunch.  Excellent food and good service.  We were visiting from NE for the Fiesta Bowl/New Year weekend.  We searched on Yelp! and decided to call at 11:00 for a 12:00 reservation. We we were greeted at the door and promptly seated.  Excellent OJ and Grapefruit juice.  Good coffee.  My daughter had the Veggie-licious skillet but added avocado  and said \"this is one of the best breakfast meals I've ever had\". My son had the pulled pork and green chile omelette and I had the Sonora potatoes and Chorizo hash (fairly spicy). We all cleaned our plates.  My wife had yogurt and fresh fruit with granola.  The waitress initially forgot to deliver the side order english muffin but she promptly brought it to the table.  We watched the owner greet other guests warmly and at one point he even placed a blanket on the back of chair to help make one of the older guests more comfortable.  We could have ordered from the lunch menu as well.   This little place is located in a quaint shopping plaza in nice neighborhood not crowded and we will definitely return when back to Scottsdale area.   Highly recommend for fresh, home cooked, comfort food with a SW twist.
2 ||| If you're looking for the same americhino fare that you had here in 1983, well, there it is.  Same menu, same recipes, same grease.\nThere's nothing too terrible about their greasy, fried: \n(rice, egg rolls, chicken, chicken wings, sesame chicken, onion rings, egg foo young, s&s pork, and jello).\nYes, even the jello was deep fried and greasy.  Not really.\nThere's just not much selection, and what you get is 'mbleh'.\n(that's half 'meh' and half 'blah')\nEveryone keeps saying \"well, at least it's only $6.\"  \nWell, for that price, I could pick from a half dozen gems within a mile radius of this nostalgic black hole boofay of yester-year.\nBut I'll generously round them up -  they're friendly, the food's tasty and filling, and fuggit it was only $6.
0 ||| This place is very lacking, to say the least. Our large party for a baseball tournament arrived to find our rooms had no phones, clock radios, missing remotes, tv's not working, no coffee, etc. The process just to turn the tv on was amazing! The furniture was dirty and at least 30 years old. Parking is an issue, especially if you have a large vehicle or truck. Spaces are extremely small and hard to get in and out of. The front desk service was not very good. Ladies were rude and not helpful. The grounds staff were nice though. Overall, for the price, this place is a huge disappointment. I would not stay here again.
2 ||| This place is solid for happy hour. It has a small dining area and a mom and pop feel to it. As others have mentioned, the food is good not great. However, I tend to also look at value for the money. The pizza has delicious thin crust due to the type of oven they have. Toppings are mediocre, they tend to put a lot of sauce and not enough cheese. That said, do you know a better slice of pizza for a buck? I don't. They have very good wings which are usually cooked perfectly and seasoned (sauced) likewise. Sliders are decent too. In this economy a dollar beer goes a long way in my book.\n    The servers have always been friendly to me, I guess I am usually in a good mood when I go out and it shows. I generally do not allow people to give me bad service. \n    The prices are unbelievable during happy hour. 40 cent wings, dollar drafts and tons of daily specials.\n     I would like to give 3.5 stars but will make up for the peron that said the same thing and lowered his to 3 by giving 4 stars. I'm an optimist.\n     See ya for happy hour @ Grimaldi's!
1 ||| Wife and I went on our Anniversary.  Reservations for 7pm.  Salad was dismal.  Took forever to get non alcoholic drinks.  Prime rib was dry and not a good cut.  Garlic mashed potatoes were a joke.  More like dry wall paste.  Never, ever again.  For the money we spent there are a LOT better options just right up the road.
3 ||| It's getting better as the new owners remodel and get in some new tenants.
4 ||| This is our favorite Indian restaurant in the city.  Very consistent and good.  Authentic decorations and music.  Be ready to search for parking during the college school year.
2 ||| This Giant Eagle truly is giant!  And believe me, that's about all it has going for it!  You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\n\nYou know that a trip to a large, \"one size fits all\" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.  You know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \n\nThat's what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo's or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill.
2 ||| I went this Wednesday for the $10 buffet and it was pretty good.  I knew where the place was so finding it wasn't hard and parking at a little before noon was easy.  Me and a coworker paid and went in, I like the stuffed chairs but it was a waste when I was sitting half out of it to eat.\n\nI don't know if the food changes but this week I saw boneless pork chops, fried chicken, buffalo shrimp, baked salmon and plenty of sides. Dessert bar had cheesecake, fruit, a variety of cookies and more. One note, drinks are not included and they don't tell you refills are charged the same, we ended up paying an additional $12 for that.\n\nThe only downsides were that the strippers were quite pushy trying to give overpriced dances ($25) and the dress code was not being enforced, plenty of shorts and tshirts. This will end up being a once a month kinda lunch for us.
2 ||| This is my favorite smoke shop to browse, but just not my favorite to shop in. The pieces here are amazing. So artful...many of them sold for hundreds of dollars, and looked more decorative than practical. In the back appears to be a little glassblowing shop where some of the more simple pipes and such are made. I totally approve of these trinkets being crafted on-sight.\n\nUnfortunately, the items that DO seem practical for use are nothing out of the ordinary. Also, the hookah tobacco (shisha) selection left quite a bit to be desired. In short, it's amazing to look at, but nothing seems worth buying unless you're a collector.
2 ||| TSA just ignore when I had a question and told me to ask someone else....wow really\n\nI want to know where I can mail out a postcard and this card just push me aside.  Now the trip is ending and I am over the fact that yes i am a freak of nature cause im asian...yea thats how i felt and i said it.  So all i want is to get an answer on where i can mail out a postcard, no harm no foul no bad intent.\n\nOther than that...this airport is a little dull, I have to admit that there are some very nice people but I just felt overall, this airport is a bit racist...
2 ||| decent, but serioualy whose going to tell at 7 in the morning after a long night of work =]
3 ||| So I tried Los Taqitos for the first time today after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives like so many others, and I'm always on the lookout for good Mexican places. So far this is the best one of it's kind that I've found in my 2 years of living in Phoenix. I got the 3 tacos, rice, and beans combo and it was really delicious. I got 2 carne asada and one chicken and although both were good the carne asada takes the cake. The tacos were fairly small but the plate was more than filling. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and he said the meat was kind of dry but the meat in my tacos tasted really good so that may just be a matter of personal preference. All in all 4 stars and I'd definitely go back!
4 ||| Cool environment, awesome service & the Mocha Especiale (I think that's how you spell it) is too die for!!!!
2 ||| It's an institution, and if you live in AZ you need to eat here.  The food is off the charts and you'll leave very full with lots of money left over.  It doesn't get better...
1 ||| This place gets 2 stars because of its proximity to DT Chandler and the staff was pretty nice. That's about all that's good.  We had a work party there and the food was pretty good. But the rooms are not so nice.  Had a funky smell and the bed sheets, we noticed when we woke up the next day, were not clean. So that was disturbing.  I mean the place isn't terrible but I don't think I'll stay again unless I absolutely have to.
2 ||| Appetizers were good and at a fair price. Those of us that had hibachi for dinner found that the quality was fine but it was way overpriced!\n\nFor a starter of dumplings and a main dish of chicken and shrimp hibachi, my tab was $40. \n\nI might return to this place if it was half that price.
3 ||| Ample portions for breakfast special, but pancakes were dense.  Big bakery and seems to be popular with locals.
4 ||| BF went here years ago, and ever since we moved back, he's mentioned it every time we go out for Thai. We finally made it in this evening for dinner.\n\nThough it's located in a strip mall, the interior d\u00e9cor is quite nice, and the service was on point throughout our visit: attentive, polite, and professional. I was impressed before we even got to the food.\n\nStarted with the Fishcakes app- $8. Good portion for the price, cakes weren't too greasy and seemed meatier than others we've had. Herbs and seasonings were mixed into the patties, making them quite flavorful. The cucumber salad was also fresh and flavorful, perfectly complement to the cakes.\nShared the hotpot of tom kha kai soup- $12. Large hot pot serving is good for us, since we love this soup. First impression of the dish was that it was incredibly well balanced. The broth was super flavorful, and there was a good amount of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and cilantro in the soup itself.\nLastly, we split the duck curry entr\u00e9e- $14. As my BF put it, \"This is possibly the best curry I've ever had.\" The duck was perfectly cooked, the curry sauce was amazing, and the pineapple and peppers worked well to bring the dish together. Portion was a good size, and came with a small side of white rice. The only change I might make to this dish would possibly be to add more veggies to it.\n\nAll in all, dinner with tip was just over $40 for two on a Friday night. Service was impeccable, food was flavorful and well balanced, and this is definitely a place I'd go back to- Vegas has a lot of good Thai restaurants, but this one has all of the elements to make it stand out as great.
4 ||| Cool for watching planes especially with kids!  Solid breakfast and great atmosphere.
0 ||| Oh, I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.  R.I.L.F.\n\nI loved you when you were also The Crystal Palace.  I loved you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag us back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells. \n\nYou've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).\n\nThe Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable and awesome that I want to eat it constantly.  But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?  \n\nAnd what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.  \n\nOh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, because we've eaten so damned much of it. \n\nSo that's how I know that this isn't so run-of-the-mill.  That's why I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.  \n\nYou're totally still a cutie, even at your ripe old age.  R.I.L.F:  Restaraunt I'd Like t....nevermind.
3 ||| Cool place to come kill some time,I come here to buy my levis, cus they got the big sizes. Also ther is a place that sells Chicano rap CDs
3 ||| Just like having a water front meal on the coast of Mediterranean, except there is an apartment complex across water way.\n\nThis location is the most scenic of the chain with a water front patio. The menu is the same as the other locations. The really inconsistency of the items on the menu. One of my frequent items is the veggie wrap, Some days it is vibrant with canalized onions and a strong taste of garlic, other days I need to use a pint of siracha to give it flavor. \n\nAlternatively for a lighter, cheaper meal I opt for the falafel pita, the falafel itself is one of the better ones in Arizona but still far from the best I ever had in Haifa, The pita is chewy and fresh and there is ample tahini and salad to fill the pita. \n\nI recommend this place for a lunch, or dinner on the patio. Occasionally on weekends there is live music inside which can make conversation a bit difficult.   Parking in this strip mall can be a bit tight too.
0 ||| My husband and I checked this place out when our membership was up at Snap Fitness. We both wanted a larger club with more options.  This was close to our house.\n\nFirst impression:  Outside is very run down.  The entire center needs a rehab.  Chipped and missing concrete as you walk up.  The fountain just outside the entrance was barely on and had huge amounts of algae.  Interior seemed VERY 80's (can you say Miami Vice?)  Lots of glass block and older looking floors.  The waiting/seating areas and main desk looked second hand.  The place had a \"not very clean\" odor when we first walked in.\n\nThe first person we had contact with never did give us his name and did not have an ID on.  Yes, he had the Bally's red shirt, but no ID.\n\nWe told him we wanted to find out their package pricing and what the club included.  He immediately wanted us to fill out an \"insurance waiver\" so he could show us around.  My husband asked if this also gave them the right to call/email us and sell our email address/phone number/address to outside vendors and he said, \"Oh no.  Its just a waiver so we don't get sued if you get hurt while I show you around.\"\n\nWell, my husband read the small print and right there it stated that by signing the form you agree to allow Bally Total Fitness to sell/transfer all personal information to their partners and other interested companies!!!\n\nWhen we pointed this out and told him we weren't signing this, he said, \"Well I can't show you around then.\"\n\nWe left!  I don't do business with underhanded sales tactics!
0 ||| I had never gone to KFC before so I thought I would try it out for fun. Very blah tasting crispy chicken to be honest. Not crispy first off and barely any meat on the wing. Can't see myself ever going back.
4 ||| Manager is pretty GREAT! And Eva bartender pretty great too! First time stop because I was thirsty for margarita . They served well! Enjoyed time there!!!! I will be back for Molcajette !!!!!!
0 ||| Being a native east coaster, I was so excited to try this food. I had been out the entire day and hadn't had a chance to eat yet,  so my friend and I stopped in late night on New Years Eve to grab a bite. The gentleman working the counter was very personal and attentive, and the food tasted pretty good... but the entire next day I was puking and running to the bathroom. I figured, maybe I am just getting to old to eat the way I used to... but after drinking a bunch of pepto, and a few amodiums, I was still having issues. I decided after a day and a half of vomiting, and intense digestion upsets to go to our local walk in clinic. $150 dollars later, they deducted I have bacterial induced colitis... they ran some blood work on me and results are pending. Considering this was all I had eaten in the 24 hour period, it's highly unlikely it came from another source. Please review proper food handling procedures with your staff, and hand washing etiquette with your crew members, before you people kill some one. I sincerely hope that no one else gets as sick as I am right now. Antibiotics, missing two days off work, feeling miserable, and having to be stuck with needless, and $150 of doctors bills, was not worth eating at your establishment. I will not return, and will ensure I do not recommend your stores or food to anyone in the future.
0 ||| I would never recommend or refer ANYONE here.  They are rude, unprofessional, and do cheap work.  The manager is arrogant and condescending, to say the least.  They \"repaired\" one of my rings and actually made it worse.  Fail.
4 ||| Gaetano Palmeri is a bona fide professional.  Having dined at his place in Calabasas, CA years ago, he's not skipped a beat.  The menu will satisfy just about anyone seeking an Italian meal with a great range of starters, a variety of pastas, great seafood and meat selections.  We're fond of the warm cabbage salad, but tonight we opted for the special arugula with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette split.  My wife devoured the barramudi with chopped tomato and I coasted along with a risotto with chicken and asparagus.  Perfect mid-week meal.\n\nThe dining room is so comfortable in a refined way.  Murals and mirrors on the walls with soft but adequate lighting goes beyond inviting.  A full bar can start or end the meal and I'm told the desserts are special.  Can't say enough good things about Gaetano's.  We're not missing a repeat visit any time soon.
3 ||| One of my favorite restaurants. Service is not too bad on busy weekends, but it makes up for the excellent food they serve. The owner decided to put two teppanyaki grills and it wasn't a bad decision, at all. If you want to save a little money on the teppanyaki, go during lunch. Sushi (rolls, sashimi, nigiri) are always awesome.
0 ||| Don't trust the sales people they are completely useless. One gave me the wrong Mac adapter, even though I stressed I thought he was incorrect. Big shocker he was and I had to drive all the way back. Of course no one there cared. Not surprised they have under two stars.
1 ||| The two stars are for our bus boy and the one attempt our server made to help us. \n\nFOOD- was horrible. The chips were ok. Salsa was ok, beans were bland.  I ordered a combo plate, a pork tamale, and a chille rellano. The pork tamale had next to no meat.. I scraped most of it out and it was one bite. The chile rellano was slimy and salty. The beans and rice were bland.  I didn't eat much of it. \n\nMy fiance ordered a shrimp burrito. It was not as described to us when we asked and it smelled. Like rotten fish. Not only that but it was full of \"scallops\". Which turned out to be bat ray wing, not even real scallops, those were chewy. He sent the whole thing back because of the smell and the tortilla was soggy/mushy it had the consistency of mashed potatoes.  15 bucks for THAT? C'mon now. \n\nOur friends had a burrito and combo plate, they were not impressed either. \n\nSERVICE- We had to wait 20 minutes for a table when over half the restaurant was empty. We ended up with a crappy table.  \n\n The bus boy should have been our waiter. He was pleasant and came back promptly and frequently to ask if we needed anything and to refill our drinks.  Our waitress wasn't awful, but she was short, and acted like we were a huge inconvenience the second she walked up.  She did however look worn out and made an attempt to be pleasant about the burrito we sent back. It took a while to have our order taken, which would have been fine had they been even slightly busy. \n\nI tried to get a group of employees attention to take the check, I held it up and they just looked at me and went back to talking. \n\nOur friends and I were leaving when my fiance was stopped by the manager and asked how everything was. He told her he felt it was over priced for the quality, and some issues with the food. Like his mushy, smelly, burrito,  and my tamale having no meat. She got snotty and said \"you're wrong , I watched them make the tamales\". She then said \"well if you had a problem you should have said something before\" ( um hello, genius, we sent food back and told our waitress!)  This is what angered us the most. Don't ask people what they thought and be rude if you don't like the answer! Very unprofessional. We still paid our full bill so it's not like we don't have a right to complain when asked.  Change the garbage you serve and you won't have as many problems!  \n\nWe won't be back, over priced,  bad food, and so-so service.
4 ||| The burgers are amazing and ridiculously reasonable! The staff is friendly and attentive. The place is super clean! They do everything right at Players! Good drinks, great lunch specials and awesome service!
0 ||| I went to Postalmax for their passport photo services. I called prior to going in for my passport photo, and was warned by the store owner to never get a passport photo done at a Walgreens, Costo, SAMS etc... due to the fact that \"they were not a  professional \" as he claimed to be. He said  I should come here to Postalmax to get the photo taken because if I went elsewhere I would be risking the chance that my passport photo would not be accepted. His fees for the photo were $20  (higher than everywhere else). Because I did not want to risk the photo being unacceptable by the state, I went to Postalmax. I took my photo to the Post Office in Fountain Hills along with all of my appropriate documentation.  The postal worker, with whom you are required to make an appointment with just to get your passport mailed in, informed me that my passport photo taken by PostalMax was not acceptable. We had to re-take the photo  and I had to pay an additional $15. I called Postalmax and told him of his unacceptable passport photo and asked for a refund.  After a lengthy conversation, he would only refund $11.79. To me this is poor business. I should have received a full $20 refund. If his photography skills are that of a professional, which he claimed, then the passport photo should have been a decent photo, accepted by the State, However it was not.  His dimly lit back room of the postalmax store, where he takes the passport photos, should have been a red flag that he was not a professional!!! I trusted his age for experience! Don't waste your time or money with this guy! You are better off going to Walgreens Costco SAMS or the Post office!! Cheaper and Professional!!!
4 ||| The water park is the highlight of this resort.  3 great water slides, lazy river and a wave pool.  For the adults they have a great bar at the pool.  The park gets really busy on the weekend so if you go, get there early.\n\nThe fitness center was great for a resort.  It had several classes each day from spin to TRX to Cross-fit.  \n\nThe room on the other hand was very outdated.  The TV's looked like they where built in the 70's, for $300 a night they could at least put a flat screen in the room. There is also a $40/ day resort fee.  \n\nWI-FI was very slow\n\nStaff was friendly with everyone I encountered.
4 ||| The people are nice, they work with you for getting things done in the best manner possible and are usually pretty quick about it.  Getting cars fixed, costs money, that's how it is.
2 ||| Giving it 3 stars for the outdoor area.  The only food I've had is their spinach quesadilla which was okay.  Nice place to grab a drink and listen to some live music. outdoor on the lake.
4 ||| AMAZING !! make sure you get there on Tues or Thursday for the Tri Tip. Portion are HUGE and food is good
1 ||| Sorry, Mary Coyle, I am officially over you. I have been a few times since my last review and your portion sizes are too inconsistent with your prices. I have gotten either twice the amount or half the amount of sundae for approximately the same price over the last few times. Last night was the last straw. For a small scoop of mint choco chip ice cream over a brownie, some whipped cream, and hot fudge, I paid $8.47. I gave you two stars because the sundae tasted good but I am not willing to come back and pay those prices for something I can get a couple of dollars less down the street. See ya...
3 ||| Great place in Stonecrest Shopping Center to stop in for a quick  bite when you aren't in the mood to cook.  This casual eatery offers pizza by the slice or made to order pizzas, salads, and a good selection of pasta and Italian favorites such as Eggplant Parmesan.
3 ||| Damn good pizza! A little spendy (hence why I didnt give them 5 stars) for what you get but regardless, the pizza is pretty damn good. The wings are decent, I think there baked instead of fried and the sauce seems a little weak. They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food.
0 ||| The main thing that needs to be said: this place naming itself after the famous Pasqual's cafe in Santa Fe is a hideous joke, and probably legally actionable.  The food at these two Madison stores is bland, dry and generic, and does not even vaguely resemble even the most mediocre New Mexican food available in NM and CO, not only in quality and taste, but in basic style.  \n\nIn fact, the green chile burritos wrapped in foil in the hot cases at virtually any convenience store down there are a large cut above this.  It's hard to call this food even a poor imitation of New Mexican food in general, much less the world-renowned creations of the chef at the real Pasqual's.  Boo!  \n\nIf you even remotely like this, or any other so-called Mexican food available in Madison, do yourself a favor and buy a cheap plane ticket to Albuquerque... you may not even make the return trip.
0 ||| I used to like this Mcdonald's location. But recently getting really disgusting. A lot of flies are flying around. Their floor is sticky. Tables and chairs are always nasty. It's really turned me off. I didn't get anything there!
0 ||| Strong kimchi and banchan game. Asked the lady if they had kimchi and she goes, \"kimchi? who taught you?\" Cause I'm white. That's racial profiling, lady!\n\nvery small shop but the kimchi and other house-made items are reason enough to go.
4 ||| Delicious Mexican food. Complimentary salsa dip kept coming. Well worth a visit
0 ||| I don't even know how they can call this pizza! The thin crust is like eating cardboard... disgusting
0 ||| 103 degrees, 50% humidity.  No, the weather is not their fault. I was willing to brave the elements because I was told this place was awesome.  1 1/2 hours later... I kept finding Granite but everyone I found was sold.  My complaint is that there were no \"sold\" tags on the slabs.  I've never been so hot, miserable and so frustrated.   I will not go there again and will tell everyone else about this experience.  Horrible.
0 ||| My friend that flew in form Seattle and my wife ate there at lunch time. The first time any of us had every been at Joes Crab Shack, and I was really excited to go there for the fist time. But OMG what a disappointment, the food was the worst I we have ever had. It's like they never cooked the food. It all came in a bag, both our Lobsters was so tough never ate it, the Corn wasn't cooked didn't eat that, the shrimp really not deveined WTF. The Sausage was um not even fit for a dog. The money we spent was way over $150.00. WOW sloppy service and please don't waste your money. I will be going to Red lobster in the future I suggest every one do the same. Its not that hard to cook seafood.  I lived in Seattle and just moved here even the worst hole seafood place wasn't this bad something needs to be done.
0 ||| After receiving coupons for so long, we finally decided to try this place. DO NOT waste your money!!!!  It is the WORST place I have ever eaten!!!  Nasty!!!  No flavor, small bits of fatty boiled chicken and way over cooked rice.  I mean it's SO BAD that I wouldn't even have my dogs eat it!!!  Because the place was empty I'm sure the food was not fresh.  I picked up my orders.  I called to inquire why it was so bad but the guy would not speak to me even I was very calm and polite.  Nobody would call me back.  I've seen the other reviews on bad food & lousy customer service.  No wonder they give out so many coupons.  Save your money & go to PF Changs for the same price and get quality!!!  These people are a rip off & don't deserve to be in business!!
1 ||| I think my wife summed it up when she remarked something to the effect of, \"Why would anyone want to go in that dive and buy overpriced, mediocre pasta?\"\n\nYeah, it was pretty mediocre.  Little more than edible, The pasta really didn't make the prospect of returning very attractive.  The marinara had so much oregano in it that it probably doubled as the pizza sauce.  The minestrone was okay, but the bread roll was a tasteless ball masquerading as sourdough.  Service was friendly enough, but that's not going to save this place.  \n\nI love me some pasta, but I don't love me Red Devil.  Pass.
4 ||| The food here is wonderful!!! We stopped here after a less then stellar experience at the MGM on our way to Mammoth CA by car. We loved the service. They are extremely accommodating. We purchased breakfast and were even able to purchase food for the road. Our waitress Lauren was so personable and knowledgable. She was able to provide us with great suggestions on food to take on the road and even refilled all of our water bottles. A very positive experience!!!
4 ||| First time at Toms..... Loved it! Ask to sit in Briannas section.  She is the very best! Tell her the crazy lady from denver that loves her red glassed sent you!
4 ||| I wish there were half as many Fausto's around town as there are Roberto's. \n\nWalking into Fausto's you will see an almost identical menu to Roberto's, but IMO Fausto's has them beat hands down on taste.\n\nI love their carne asada and their carne asada taco platter is the best I've had. Hearty portions of high quality food. Excellent Spanish rice too.\n\nThe California burrito with the carne asada and french fries inside is pretty awesome too.\n\nThe service at this location has always been fast and friendly. The guys in the back are usually singing along with the Mexican music and look like they are enjoying their work. When you open the meal box it looks like they actually care about making it look good and don't just throw it all together as quickly as possible like some other places.\n\nIMO they have the best fast Mexican food in town. Just wish there were more locations.
2 ||| First of, I really love Buca's food. It's really good and a favorite of mine and my roommate's is the Baked Ziti. We love the atmosphere of it and we honestly have a good time(usually) when we go but recently...the past few visits haven't been so great.\n\n(03/13)Starting off with last night(Wednesday), my roommate and I planned to go  after I got off work for their National Raviolli day coupon. We got there at 9:20, 40 minutes before they closed. I know it's a little late but we can normally get done within that time frame. But when we walked in, we waited for a few minutes before the hostess finally walked into the waiting area...with her purse over her shoulder.\n\nShe told us they had already closed and after mentioning that we thought they didn't close until 10(we checked the website before going), she reluctantly took us to a table...in a room where everyone else was. It was a little awkward for us and after waiting for maybe 5 minutes while discussing whether we should stay or not, we left. The impression we got upon arriving, although late, left a sour note. We're both very disappointed and ended up settling for pizza(which is no where near as good as their food). I was really looked forward to it all day until I showed up.\n\n(02/13)The time before that I went with my roommate again and a friend. We arrived an hour before close(again late I know) but this time we had no problem getting seats. Our problem was with the service. Our actual waitress didn't start serving us until AFTER our food had arrived. A waitress from a different section noticed us and helped us out until our waitress finally showed up. We didn't get refills until we had to stop someone to ask for them which shouldn't have been that hard when there honestly weren't more than four other groups there at the time. Again, it was disappointing.\n\n(01/13)The time before that experience I went with my parents and three friends. It was a busy Friday night but we didn't have to wait long to get a table. The service was great but the annoying part was that every table but ours in the room claimed to be having a birthday. Literally every table. So we had to listen to their birthday song five times just in that one room while it went on in several other rooms. It ended up being very irritating and I honestly don't believe that everyone having a birthday in Charlotte that night would all go to Buca.\n\nOverall I really love Buca Di Beppo's food but the service has increasingly gone downhill since our first try in early 2012. Now when I go I see more problems than good experiences and honestly, I think the only way I'll be getting their food from now on is if I go with a large group early on in the day or through take out(which is usually cheaper).\n\nSorry Buca...but I think you deserve this one.
4 ||| Although I generally see Dr. Erdos at the Scottsdale location, I get my allergy shots at this location.  Occasionally, when I don't feel like schlepping to two different offices, I'll see a doctor at this location.  I saw Dr. Ching last week and she was fantastic.  Extremely knowledgeable, thorough, and recognized a recommendation from my ENT was in my file and addressed it with me because it's a specialty of hers.  \n\nMuch like Dr. Erdos, she provided an excellent level of care and I would not hesitate to see her again.
2 ||| I had lunch here with Rand H. I started with the Mexican soup which was very good for a Chinese buffet. The main dishes were all OK ,with nothing really screaming YUMMMM. but the grand re opening special of $4.99 it was a great value. To many better Chinese buffets close by. I think they will struggle here.I give them 6 months and it will close again.
0 ||| I was pretty nervous after reading all of these negative reviews, but I called, was picked up promptly, and taken where I needed to go safely. Got pretty great service at 4:30am.
4 ||| I always have pretty good experiences here.  And I almost always take my car here for service, with the Pep Boys Rewards, it definitely makes it worth it.  I've found the mechanics here to be honest about what service is needed, they don't try to rake you over the coals and get you to do a bunch of unnecessary stuff.  And there are usually good coupons online for whatever you need done that make the prices reasonable.
4 ||| Went for a romantic dinner with my wife. Excellent food. Chose the 5 course selection. Delightful service, knowledgeable waiters, amazing food. We decided to pair cocktails with our pre, main and dessert courses. It was a wonderful choice. I highly recommend the duck and salmon. In fact, I recommend everything they have. Will definitely be returning. If you can, take a quick tour of the house, it is beautiful. Although, the classical music playing is somewhat cliche of a 1980s movie scene where a ragamuffin walks in and every turns and looks at them, it is very classy. All in all, please make this restaurant your choice for a celebration; let it be an anniversary or a birthday. If you have any questions, the staff will be more than glad to assist you.
1 ||| The best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere. My husband and I went here during restaurant week & left feeling disappointed. Our waiter was not very attentive. The bread they bring out is good but the bean topping to go with it was overpowered with onions. We both got the seafood salad as an appetizer and it was just ok. Nothing spectacular. We both also had the lamb as an entree. It was cooked perfectly to medium & was very tender but it lacked seasoning. It would have been wonderful with some seasoning. For dessert I had the panna cotta. It was not impressive. The presentation was nice but it had no flavor. My husband had the chocolate cake which tasted like a frozen cake you get from the supermarket. The manager insisted it is made fresh in house but I'm not sure if I believe that. Overall we were very disappointed, especially with the good reviews we had read. We will not go back.
3 ||| My family of six ate at Network's after traveling. The waitress was very friendly and patient. We shared meals and she split them up for us without asking. Food was alright. The sweet potato friends were amazing. It was a little pricey, which is why we split, but that's not any different than any other hotel grills.
1 ||| I've never been a fan of Phoenix's Sky Harbor. Seems liek I always have to switch concourses or at least the wing of the concourse and my flights usually get delayed.\n\nNot sure what the reasons are, but it makes me want to take measures to avoid this airport and I fly ALOT!
2 ||| It wasn't a very big coffee shop. My boyfriend and I met a small group of friends around 2 pm on a Saturday. The place was crowded with people stopping in. There was only one person to run the counter so the service was pretty slow. I told the woman I found the place on Yelp because it said to mention that for a .50 off per drink discount. She didn't give us the correct discount. I guess I should've spelled it out so she understood what I was wanting. I ordered the Mocha Especiale. It was alright, but it tasted a little gritty to me. So, overall I wasn't that impressed and it's a place I can live without.
1 ||| This store has a lot of toys.   Apparently toy shopping is so important these days that the store has to be open at 9pm on Thanksgiving day.   I am completely in awe at the depths of stupidity this nation has fallen to and this store is leading the way.   We shop here when looking for children's gifts.   It isn't the best store for atmosphere and so not the most fun place to shop in the first place.  Anyway, we won't be going here ever again since they are opening on a holiday.  If they didn't have this policy I would give them three stars with one star being for keeping their store hours away from the holiday out of respect for their employees.  If they treat their employees this way imagine how much they care about their customers.
0 ||| This place is pretty dumpy.\n\nWork sent me to Phoenix for a couple of days.  I had a suite, but it was not very sweet.  The bathroom door didn't shut, and swung open into the middle of the room.  When I got up to go to the bathroom at night, I ran into the door.  I can only blame Country Inn and Suite for the first night, the second night when I bumped into the bathroom door in the dark, I blamed only myself.\n\nThe bed smelled like my old roommate's closet... musty and dirty.  Two of my towels were stained with something yellow, I am hoping coffee and not urine...\n\nI didn't really expect better, but that's my review.
4 ||| I showed up at 5:40PM with a closing time for them of 6PM with an almost flat tire (perpetrator? You ask - screw!). I felt bad & told the guy they could just patch & I would come back in the morning - he said we don't care what time it is, we take customers until closing, no matter what the problem! I was already impressed (even though I'm smart enough to realize it's about business & the almighty dollar & bottom line). They didn't have to see me & I was grateful that they did! Unbeknownst to me, I was riding on 4 bald tires - clear to see - and I needed replacements. They handled it with efficiency & precision, getting it done by 6:30pm. I had already called my husband who was on his way to meet for dinner because I thought surely it would take longer, but alas the Cardinal game was on & they know how to get it done to get home to their personal lives. Needless to say we went for dinner at one our other fav's, Guru Palace across the street, so it all worked out! Now me and my car are riding like a dream thanks to them! Cody & Preston? & whoever the guy was who put my tires on were courteous & fun & now have my business in the future. Great job guys!\nThanks =)
4 ||| Customer service is always top notch - returns always easy, greeters always helpful.  \n\nI have never had a problem using 2,3, 4 or even 5 coupons for 20% off or their $5 off discounts either.  \n\nGreat clearnace, good end of season sales, amazing selection of colors for bedroom or bathoom.  Excellent space savers & container suggestions for clutter.\n\nLove their glassware like Ridel & Elisch & Mikasa stemware.
2 ||| I've been a longtime member of Bally's and later LA Fitness among various fitness clubs over the past decade.  Since relocating to the Phx area, I took up membership at LA's Chandler (S. Tempe) location.  Having enjoyed the Chandler locations cleanliness, crowd and excellent pilates and other core group classes, I never felt in-sync or a genuine interest from the training/management staff.  Infact, just the opposite, I have experienced curt, condescending and rude behavior if unwilling to partake in paid training sessions or agree with fitness \"facts\" taken out of context.  In due time, I moved 3mi north of Dobson Rd., and was never pleased with the state of the Tempe location nor the student athletes which frequent it.  Still, simply wanting a workout, I would frequent Tempe for quick workouts close to home and Chandler for classes.  Fortunate for the Chandler location, it's great classes and cleanliness keep members returning despite a few of it's arrogant and condescending staff trainers.
1 ||| Quality of food has taken a beating. It used to be so good - I'm talking about the Macadamia nut chicken. We probably won't go back.
2 ||| I am a consulting engineer that frequently stays at the La Quinta near this pub.  The food is decent and the drinks weak.  This review would be considerably higher if the prices advertised on their happy hour menu were accurate.  I am constantly over charged at this place to accommodate the under charging of locals.  Not to mention the female bartender is constantly complaining to the locals about her life and ignoring the rest of the bar.   While this is going on the obviously over served locals begin to throw things at her that end up hitting me.  If this place was managed correctly it would be a decent establishment.
2 ||| I got to try this last Friday about 8:30pm (didn't realize they close at 9pm).\n\nThe food was above average, and the prices are low, but the atmosphere is woefully out of date and dilapidated. \n\nI appreciate the longevity and family-run aspects, but come on guys it's time for a remodel (at least some fresh paint and better lighting). A few booths would be a huge upgrade from the wobbly tables, and I'm also not a huge fan of paper plates...\n\nThis would be a better choice for a quick lunch on the cheap, or take out.
4 ||| After years of worrying about our pup being stuck in a crate at the groomers, we finally decided to try a mobile groomer whose entire attention would be on our girl. Linda from Galloping Groomers was the perfect solution! She was extremely loving to our dog and groomed her exactly the way we like...the process really could not have been easier or more positive! I highly recommend this reliable company. We won't be going anywhere else for future grooming appointments!
3 ||| My little one and I stopped in for a sweet treat the other day I let her choose. We had the chocolate mousse cups and my bad I didnt take pics because I couldnt wait to dig in. Working from top to bottom it was in layers. It had a huge fresh strawberry on top it was garnished w some thick chocolate slivers then there was the cream so light and fluffy I mixed it with the mousse at the very bottom there was a small layer of choc cake  and the whole thing was in a flower petal shaped cup made completely of choc. The little one could not eat all of hers and it was hard to waste such goodness but I didnt want to overdose. Mental note next time one to share is good. I also bought a few of there decorated pretzels they are such pretty little works of art I want to    recreate them and put them on my kitchen walls! The staff is always pleasant here AJ's has always been a fav of mine I like their catered dessert trays they are always a hit!
2 ||| 3x. So far so good.
4 ||| I will put this as simply and in as few words as possible.  If you don't eat here every wednesday and thursday you are an idiot.\n\nwed- 99 cent fish tacos, 1.50 corona\nthurs- 1.25 assorted tacos, 99 cent margarita\n\nsee you there
4 ||| I like this airport. It's small but once you get past security all gates are accessible from a central space, which means you don't have to say good-bye to friends flying on a different airline. This airport also has some decent stores and restaurants. \n\nI love the cool white rocking chairs but they are very popular. Grab one if you can! Also, of you land in the day time look out the window to enjoy the view of hills, trees and pretty buildings.
3 ||| we go here at least once a month for the tavarua fish tacos with honey-wasabi sauce-- worth the wait, or you can call ahead and pick them up to-go.
3 ||| My second time at Macayo's, menu seems to be hit-or-miss. I ordered the lunch special chicken taco, chicken enchelada, and beans. Enchelada was fine, but the taco was deep fried with too much cheese. Last visit was better, but can't remember the entree.
1 ||| I have been going to this Sam's club for many years. I like coming here. I like most of the people working here except one. There is one person who flies under the radar. It's Peter the Greeter. More like Peter the Dirty Old Man. When he first started working there in 2010 he saw me and took my card out of my hand and turned it over to read my name thereby forcing me to engage in polite conversation with him for about a mntue. He thought I was interested in him; he is old enough to be my father or older. He then for a few months would touch my shoulder every time I came in and left the store forcing me to look up a him. Then one night when no one was leaving the exit he moved from the entrance to the exit to catch me leaving to check my receipt and quickly put his arms around me before I had time to brace myself and gave me a squeeze. I called the manager the next morning crying. It has been 4 years now and Peter has now gotten bolder towards me when he checks my ticket he gets close to my face with his angry look and says \"Have a nice day ma'am\" as I walk out the door. \nHe does this while his coworkers aren't around. Other times he behaves and won't act like that to me. \n\nI hope Peter has a nice day too! It has been 4 years and he still has a bruised ego.\n\nI have never had a problem with anyone in this store before like this. What a weirdo.
0 ||| Spare your expense account. The steaks aren't hot. The veggies aren't fresh. The service is the kind that sticks their fingers in glasses to carry them. The steak knives are old and dull. The clientele has no qualms about putting their feet up on chairs in the dining room. Granted, I wasn't expecting even Ruth's Chris, but a steakhouse this is not. I can cook a $9 strip on my Weber and it comes out better than their $38 16 oz strip. Their parking lot is full of rental cars, but there must be better options. Spare your expense account.
0 ||| Cabo I really wanted to like you... I have given you a few tries before writing this review. \nYou do have a few things going for you.\n1. Great location\n2. Interesting Tex-Mex decor \n3. A really nice outdoor seating area\n\nLet's start with the staff, the bartender gave me the wrong change ( not just keeping a buck or two for a tip- maybe it was a mistake) and fought with me for about 5 minutes before I had to show him the price of my drink in the menu. I think my waitress hated me or just hated life.\n The salsa is corn based- okay, I can get that you want to be different, but the salsa is bland and simply tastes like canned corn. Our chips were stale. The queso would have been okay, but it was cold, which made it form into solid cheese- not very good on stale chips. \nI decided to get fish tacos- I figured with a place called ' fish taco' I couldn't go wrong. My shrimp tacos were really boring. It seemed like the kitchen ran out of ingredients  I think they were beer battered, to be honest I couldn't really tell. My whole tables meals came out at different times and our sides to our meals were incorrect. \nI would have told my waitress that our food was incorrect, but I couldn't find her for the rest of the night, until our checks came.... $12.00 for two bland and skimpy tacos. No thank you! \nI really don't like to give bad reviews, but I can't find a reason to return to Cabo Fish Taco.
4 ||| I went to the mesa location a few months ago but don't remember ever coming to this location. We had an in-service day at work so we had an extra long lunch. So me and some coworkers decided to head over here. Great choice. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but their chimis are great. I got the shredded beef one this time. So good. I love them. There is a reason it is their specialty. If you go to a steak house you don't order the chicken or go to a sushi place and order a hamburger. So if it the specialty why get anything else.\nMy girlfriend loves Macayo's too so we will definitely be back. So will my coworkers if we have another long lunch.
4 ||| The food here is yummy for the money :) I tried the Birria de Chivo (lamb in a tomato type of gravy), came with Rice and Beans as well as a stack of small, thick flour tortillas...all for $6.75. The lamb was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth....totally delicious and definitely ethnic Mexican cuisine at it's best!
1 ||| Had a water, and possible mold emergency on Friday night, I called them very early Saturday morning explaining the situation, and after four days, I still haven't got a call back from their project manager to set up a time for them to come out.  I'm going with another company.  I wish they'd told me 4 days ago they were too busy to come.
0 ||| Sadly I tell you that I moved my friend away from Huger.  It is really a matter of what works for the individual and this wasn't the correct place for Norma.  They don't provide some of the amenities which are essential for her such as having a private bathroom for each room;  also, a nicer dining area and great room.  I also think they just didn't have enough outside activities for her.\n\nHuger was not the right place for my friend.  Doesn't mean its bad just health care in any case is such an individual thing.   It is no different for dementia care.
2 ||| Like the food but the overall experience here isn't as good as the one in Columbia, SC.  I think a little upgrading and decor touches could help, the food is really more like 3.5 approaching 4 star -- depending on the menu item.  Outdoor seating in season.  Location is convenient to South Park folks, and plentiful.
4 ||| OMG!! Had A Blast! Scarowind is soo fun (However I don't get scare, it was still awesome!! The people who work there ( trying to scare people) were soo friendly and funny! Gotta say, I had the best night of my life with my friends ( and scarowind buddies XD) ! Obviously I went at 6pm and left at 12 am means it was awesome! So I can't wait for next year Scarowind! Love love this theme park!!!
4 ||| This was the church I went to because it was the closest one to me while I was living in Chandler. It somehow felt strange to me at first because I was used to the old churches in Mexico. After going a few times, getting involved, and meeting the community, I knew this was \"home.\" Now I live almost 1/2 hour away, and I still go to St. Andrew the Apostle Church.\nI especially love the garden- peaceful, refreshing, and welcoming.
0 ||| Despite being a Marriott-brand hotel, Courtyard Pittsburgh Downtown's service and room qualities were not up to par with the Marriott standard but still charged Marriott price.\n\nI had a bad impression of this hotel before I even entered. I made a two-night reservation for a business trip, but I was stranded in an airport overnight because of cancelled flights. I called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to change my reservation, but the receptionist was not having it. She was completely unsympathetic to my plight and insisted me to pay for the night that I'm not staying. Eventually, I had to get my project manager to resolve this issue. \n\nBoth the room and the lobby were not spacious, although that's understandable given that the hotel was in downtown. What's not understandable was the creaking floor throughout the hotel floor, which amplified no matter how light my steps were. Good thing that I was not living below night owls, but that would not matter because the AC unit was too loud to get a good sleep anyway. Why would a Marriott hotel have an AC unit that's louder than my grandma's AC unit from the 1980s is completely beyond me.\n\nSeriously reconsider if you decide to live here. Aside from sub-par room and service that are unusually low by the Marriott standard, note that the only available parking nearby will escalate the unjust price that you have to pay to stay in this hotel.
3 ||| Despite the fact that since the day I learned to drive I was coming downtown for baseball games and now I live in downtown, I had no idea that Coach and Willie's is downtown!  Was I missing a lot?  Not really.  It is pretty decent though.\n\nI have no idea why we decided to come here, but I remember reading a lot of great things about the lobster bisque, and it was cold outside, so it sounded wonderful.  When we walked inside, a girl asked us what game we were there to watch.  She gave us the weirdest look when we told her we were just there to eat.  We seated ourselves and perused the menus for a good 10 minutes before she came back around.\n\nI ordered a cup of the lobster bisque and the crab cobb salad.  I guess I was going for a shellfish theme there.  The bisque came out first and was not what I expected.  I was thinking a smooth, fairly thin but creamy soup.  What I got was pretty thick and hot a lot of chunks of peppers and some good sized pieces of lobster.  It was good, but it must have been at the end of the pot, because it was just really strangely thick and it had a bit of a skin.  As a side note, I had a fresher serving of it at the State of Downtown Event and it was really fantastic.  My salad was pretty standard, but it was very large and filling.  I would possibly get it again.\n\nI may come back here again, but who knows.  They have lots of great TV's so it would be an awesome place to watch any game.  If they start playing MLS games, we may frequent this place a lot more in the future.
3 ||| You'd think that between hole-in-the-wall Sultan's Grill and a more established-place like Paymon's, the bigger restaurant would win.  I've gotta say, I really like some of Sultan Grill's foods better.  Their taboule has a better flavor than the taboule at Paymon's and is fresh and fluffy rather than heavy, dense and weighed down with olive oil (like Whole Foods' is).\n\nSome people have complained about the gyros, and I do wish they used only lamb rather than beef and lamb for their gyros and entrees. I don't order gyros from them because I've had better meat elsewhere.  Their falafel is pretty awful (hey, that rhymes!).  \n\nTheir baba ganoush is garlicky heaven. The hummus has a nice, creamy texture and tastes great. I even like the rice they serve on the side. The french fries are flavorful.  But I order from them because I love the salads, like the fatoush- YUM!   \n\nThe ambience is definitely dive-level. Rickety tables and cheap chairs. No decor to speak of.  But I usually don' t eat there since they deliver and do carry out (love the delivery guy! Hi, if you're reading this, delivery guy!)  \n\nI know a few people have left poor reviews that seem to be related to the gyros/meat. Sultan's Grill should improve that to attract more people. My four stars are for the hummus, baba ganoush, generous pita portions, the salads, the friendly service, and the delivery.
0 ||| That might be the last time I use the YELP search to try and satisfy my sweet tooth... No ring pops or bottle caps here folks!!! But since I was already there I decided to stop in and much to my surprise there was a solid vending machine next to the restrooms.. The $5 cover seemed a little steep just to peruse the vending machine selection... The young ladies working  the establishment seemed to be enjoying the surroundings.. A dimly lit ambiance in which to enjoy a \"Big Hunk.\" Music bumping, fists pumping, and scantily clad women swinging around the red vines flashing their skittles around freely for the taking. Decided to leave a short time afterwards, before I was tempted to get a Milky Way. Top notch establishment, will visit again! Probably going to need another dentist visit after satisfying that sweet tooth.
4 ||| came out from San Diego and looking for a real good medetranian place out here to start going to. When we drove by Gyro's House, we wanted to try it out. The food was AMAZING and the service was soo good, that it reminded me of a place back in california. I really like this spot and am going to keep coming back here very often. The people working here were so nice and funny. You can tell its a family business and not just another chain. The portions were really good and fulling. Great place!
1 ||| While I LOVE Whole Foods, this location has some of the worst customer service.  Not sure why they have such an attitude, but I avoid this store if possible.\nThe cashier didn't say Hello, or thank you or Good Bye...it was very strange!!
2 ||| easy to drop off ink cartridge for recycling but they don't offer battery recycling. kind of a bummer.
3 ||| Been living in Arizona for almost 4 years now finally went too this place they have the best Reuben sandwich and also there potatoes salad and can't forget there awesome dessert . Great place
4 ||| I've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant for almost 3 years since I moved from SF bay area. I had a dim sum lunch today and my tummy is happy, happy. It's a good sign that restaurant was crowded and I saw many Asian customers. I've been dreaming about eating dim sum for a long time. I had sticky rice, shumai, har gow, gailan and sesame balls. I love them all, can't wait to go there again. The price is very reasonable and very authentic. No more P.F Chang or Panda Express, lol
0 ||| Sorry, but our pizza was cold.  All nine cuts of it.  And the garlic wings didn't taste like garlic.  Maybe it was an off night?
1 ||| After shopping at Cost Plus I was pretty hungry and this was right next door so I thought I would give it a try.\nIt was 10 bucks with a drink since I did not have a coupon. Its a very small salad bar. Everything looked fresh enough but there was not the variety you get @ Sweet Tomatoes. They only had 3 kinds of soup plus chili. The baked breads were pretty empty and looked less than fresh.\nThe highlight was the sponge cake and strawberries & whipped cream. I love strawberry shortcake!\nI dont think I will be coming back anytime soon.
2 ||| This place is a hit or miss, sometimes their food comes out very good but sometimes it comes out burned and/or thrown together quick.
1 ||| The food is okay, the salsa is amazing, the prices are high.\n\nThis used to be my favorite restaurant, but it's hard to support a place that doesn't bother to fix their website when it lapses. Sure, it may just be an oversight, but it's the little things that make a difference and El Zocalo doesn't do them.\n\nAlso, I just received a possible fraud text from my bank asking about a charge from El Zocalo a few days ago. I replied, then called Customer Service as I watch 9 charges overdraft my bank account.\n\nI'm not saying El Zocalo did anything wrong, but that's too much to solely be a coincidence.\n\nLittle things, right?\n\nI won't be going here again, but I'll miss the carne asada plate.
1 ||| Not terribly impressed. The atmosphere was a cute, slightly dated diner, which I like. I will say the bathrooms were nasty, which is never a good sign in a restaurant. The food was underpar. I could tell the eggs for the omelet were the fake ones, and the hash (if that's what you can call it) was stringy and mushy, I also felt like it tasted a little too old. The veggies seemed fresh, and the toast was okay. For $10 after tip I will probably never be back. If you like places like Denny's I would go as far as to say this is better than that, but with so many more options in this area I personally don't think it can compete. I would recommend The Acacia Cafe or Berthas up on Indian School.
2 ||| Went on a Sunday at yelp's recommendation and was pleased with the food, but my overall experience wasn't great. The douche who took my order told me ten minutes and when I arrived exactly ten minutes later, he says, \"That was fast!  I just put your order in right now!\"  I was thinking this food better be damn good you knucklehead... \nI ordered the 222 Breakfast with 2 Pancakes, 2 Sausage and 2 Eggs.  The eggs were perfectly fluffy and seasoned to perfection and traveled well for a pick up order.  The breakfast sausage was really good and I am very picky about good breakfast sausage.  It was fresh and cooked very well.  I ordered a side order and demolished them also.  The pancakes were thick and fluffy, very very good pancakes!\n\nMy wife ordered the cinnamon french toast and while she just thought it was good, I thought they were the best I'd ever had!  I almost had to pull the car over in the middle of traffic on my way home to take a bite.  The smell was intoxicating and literally almost drove me insane on my short drive home.\n\nOverall very good food, but the guy who took my order was not with it.  The only redeeming quality of the customer service was the nice young lady who handed me my food with a smile.\n\nOh and did anyone mention it's behind the Home Depot? hahah\n\nPS - No wait on Sunday at 9am, got right in.  Plenty of seats, but it was starting to fill up at about 9:30am
2 ||| Beyond the fact that I like their green milk tea and rose milk tea, I have nothing good to say about this place.  Service, as everyone else on here seems to agree, is HORRIBLE!! I don't know why I even bother tipping (when eat in) anymore.  I usually tip a very small % because the service is THAT bad.  Now that I think about it, they charge over $6 for a large drink (!!!!) and add so much ice, I shouldn't have to tip.  If I ever go back and actually sit down to enjoy my drink, I will not be leaving a tip. \n\nAnd another thing that have intrigued me for a long time is that, every time we go get a beverage to go (I order the same thing every time), they charge me differently.  I don't get it.  How can the same drink be priced differently each time?  My boyfriend thinks it's because he's non-Asian and they think they can rip him off because he's white.  I don't know how true that is but it is quite strange, don't you think?
3 ||| The Elbow Room exceeded my expectations.  The Novemburger was creative and flavor full.  Lunch time on a Saturday seemed quiet though, and the ambiance seemed to be lacking a certain something.
0 ||| We just made the mistake of signing up for the \"Whole Home DVR\" - at a cost of $79.99 for installation plus two hours of my time waiting while the tech completed the install.  Cox's TV commercial proudly touts \"record up to 16 shows at once!\" - what they don't tell you (except in very fine print on the cox website) is that each DVR can only record TWO shows at once, with a maximum of 8 DVR's available per household (hence the 16 shows recording at once).  However, just as with the previous DVR's we had, you can't watch anything on live TV if you're recording two shows - you either have to watch one of the shows you're recording or cancel a recording in order to watch live TV.   The only \"new\" feature of the Whole Home DVR is that you can watch a recorded program on any TV that features a DVR box.\n\nSo, in essence, I just paid $80 to have \"new\" DVR boxes installed that do the absolute same thing that my previous DVR boxes did.  The only difference is that now my mother-in-law can watch the same soft core porn my husband and I record on Cinemax!! \n\nIn other words, don't bother with Cox's Whole Home DVR - it's a ripoff!
3 ||| Good Food....The Part-Time Hostess Is Awesome....
4 ||| I traveled from Michigan, seeking the best team of dentists to remove a failing implant and replace a front tooth that had to be extracted in 2009. I am fortunate in that I can travel for what I have researched and feel is the best dental care possible.\nI have had three procedures completed in Dr. Day's office since September 2012. I've been in his office possibly seven times in the last 15 months. Every time I've been in his office I was always greeted cordially by his staff. My appointment times that were scheduled never were late. Dr. Day's office is on time. Offices I had been to in Michigan sometimes let me sit and wait for over 60 minutes beyond the scheduled appointment time. Dr. Day himself always greets his patients. Once when I was waiting to see him, I could hear his assistant begin to brief him on my case and he quickly replied that he knew my case history clearly. Dr. Day prepares for his patients.   \nHe truly cares about his patients' comfort level while undergoing a procedure. I never was in any pain or discomfort during any of the procedures in Dr. Day's office. \nEvery time I've had a procedure completed, (implant removed, implant placed, gum adjustment) the healing has gone smoothly. I have never left his office and subsequently gotten an infection or had any other complications post-surgery. \nI am a musician and I look forward to getting back to playing my flute, piccolo and oboe. These lifelong activities would not be possible, if it wasn't for Dr. Day's skill as a surgeon and his complete attention to detail. \nEach time I have been in Dr. Day's office I get the feeling that Dr. Day and his staff truly function as a team; one that is friendly and caring. Dr. Day and his staff are 100% professional, confident and sincere. \nUnfortunately, I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I can't recommend him to too many friends and family due to the 2,000 miles between his office and my home, but I have let the dozen or so friends I have in Phoenix know he is the oral surgeon to see.  Dr. Day and his colleague Dr. Chal have ended nearly six years of dental misery and for that I am forever grateful. \nSusan S.
4 ||| My girlfriend had been going here for over a year so I decided to stop in and give it a try. What I quickly discovered was that Kabob Grill has one of the best chicken kabobs i've ever had the pleasure of stuffing in my face, thanks guys!
2 ||| .My family has eaten at the Cactus Rd. Red Lobster periodically for over 15 years. Mostly the food has been good. Two weeks ago we attempted to have lunch a little after 12:40PM. The couple in front of us was seated immediately but we were told it would be a ten minute. When I inquired as to why the wait,  hostess lied, and said that there were no tables or booths that were ready. This was interesting as I could see two booths that were obviously ready. This is clearly a management decision to not utilize part of the dining room as they do not want to fully staff even during the busiest lunch hour. Forcing the hostess to lie to customers is deplorable. Years ago I ran into this same thing at the neighboring Olive Garden. I stopped eating at that location just as I have now stopped eating at this particular Red Lobster. Restaurants are a service business and there is no reason to eat at a place that does something like this.
2 ||| This place is great for happy hour. As one review noted, the staff is very friendly, and if it's a little past 6:30, they'll let you squeeze one more drink in!  Appetizers are so-so, small portions, but cheap during happy hour, so why not! \n\nGreat for a get-together. Great service. Good happy hour menu. I've never tried dinner here, and never really thought to!
0 ||| Pharmacy is terrible. The are slow and disorganized with poor customer service. I use them rarely, but each time has been a terrible experience.
0 ||| I found this monogramming place in Dilworth and, although I don't need anything monogrammed at the moment, I wanted to check it out for the future. You walk in and are basically on top of everything; there is a pathway cleared amongst all the items and 2 counters that forces you in and around the store even if you don't want to go. I was immediately looked at as if I were in the wrong place as I had nothing in my hands to be monogrammed, and was quickly and snottily asked if I was dropping anything off. I was stuck behind a gaggle of women debating which Kate Spade purse they wanted done as I desperately tried to get out but could hardly make my way around them. I may try again when I actually have the need for some monogramming, and I will try to overlook the pretentiousness of the employees and clientele.
3 ||| I has a much better experience the second time I came in.  The guys were helpful and informative.  And cheerful.  They didn't have the car we needed but gave us lots of good info.
0 ||| Disorganized lines at check-in. Old plane seats that reminded me of times when I flew with family when I was like 8 years old. Bored-looking flight attendants.\n\nHere's a story: I've never been so frightened by an airline associate in my life. While I was up getting checked in, a TSA officer approached the associate helping me, a tired looking older Asian lady, with a customer whose son had booked the wrong flight for him. The TSA officer explained the situation and asked the associate to help fix the problem. My associate claimed it wasn't her fault. The two proceeded to bicker back and forth with increasing volume and attitude until everyone in the general vicinity had stopped to listen to them yell at each other about good customer service and yadayada. When the TSA officer stormed off and the associate turned back to me, I thought she was going to bite my head off.\n\nAnywho, luckily none of my flights were delayed or rudely handled like some of the over reviewers I see here, so extra gold star. But I will avoid US Airways from now on.
2 ||| Very good service, food was pretty good, liked the atmosphere as well. Doesn't stand out that much, as far as being exceptional food or anything unique or different, hence the 3 star rating. Would go back again... in a year.
4 ||| I've driven past this place hundreds of times and wondered - who would need to go here for a battery? Drug stores sell them, Target, OfficeMax, BestBuy, and on and on. Why them?\n\nThen the battery in my car's key fob died. It's important to note that my car doesn't have a real key; the fob transmits to the car and it lets me unlock the door by touching the handle, it sets the seat/mirrors up the way I like them and, oh yeah - it lets me start the car by touching a button. There's an emergency key but I have no idea how it works.\n\nSounds like an easy fix - just put in a new battery right? True, IF you can find the ^*(@#^% battery.  Walgreens - no, Target - no, BestBuy - hell no, OfficeMax - nope.  Batteries Plus - Yep!\n\nWhile I was there the clerk helped two other people. The first guy had a battery from an ATV. The clerk checked it out and told the guy the battery was shot but it was only a year old so he should go back to the dealer and see if he could get it replaced under warranty.  \n\nThe second guy had a battery from a WaveRunner. The clerk checked it out and said it was OK but it just needed a charge because it's been sitting around.  He suggested the guy buy a Battery Tender so it wouldn't happen again. When the guy said no, he offered to charge the battery for him at no cost but it would take a few hours.\n\nTwo potential sales and he let them off the hook for free. I'm sure the $6 I spent made the day!\n\nNo, you wouldn't go here for A, AA, AAA or D's but anything else - yes!
1 ||| The hostess sat us at a table that is designed to expand to the table adjacent to us for larger groups. We sat maybe 20 inches from total strangers with his toddler. Both were quiet but just too close. Made me uncomfortable for the whole duration. Food was quick and I'm a fan of Denny's anyhow (pancakes). The carpet was quite dirty which makes the whole place seem dirty. Just an observation
4 ||| This is a great casual family diner, everything a diner should be. Incredibly fast service, super friendly attitude, wholesome delicious food, variety galore and reasonable prices. I really enjoyed eating breakfast here and would recommend it without hesitation. And where else could you try gourmet corn mush infused with bacon and other goodies?! Go Hoosiers!!
0 ||| This company is a complete sham! \"Jessica\" told me that the compressor for the a/c unit would be covered, they could not get anyone out there for 2 more days (never mind that it was 103 degrees outside when I called). After much frustration and finally having to get the local sales rep involved, they scheduled repair for the next day. Only, they would not cover the compressor repair. They have only one repair company that they work with for EVERYTHING and refuse to extend beyond that one company when it is  too busy. Stay away from this warranty company and go with a larger company if you feel you must have a home warranty.
4 ||| My first time going to this place. It wasn't to crowed when we got there, but once it reached a certain time (past 10pm) the atmosphere changed. Which I didn't mind, because I'm from NY which means I'm a city girl.\n\nThe service was good also. Even though it was getting busy the waiter kept coming and asking if we needed anything. I will definitely go back.
0 ||| I went in on 6-19-13 to take care of a customer service problem (I got charged for 4 pairs of shoes when I only purchased 3!).  The lady at the front desk was a young girl (she had a manager in training badge on) and she was not very nice.  She kept saying I don't want to get in trouble (like 5 or so times) and then she had to make a phone call to another store and she kept saying out loud to the person on the other end of the phone how her customer was getting upset at her and I was standing right there (how rude!!!).  Bottom line is she was super unprofessional and not very smart or helpful.  I can't believe that they would hire someone like that and then to potentially put them in a manager in training program is such a joke.  :-(  Go somewhere else for shoes!  There is an Omega shoes and sports store in the same shopping center that is super helpful and nice....definitely go there instead!  :-)
0 ||| Closed on Sundays? Automatic low rating.   Some people have to work weekends, and it's frustrating to walk up to a place while you're hungry and have to turn around.  If the company doesn't have a national policy of being closed on Sundays,  then you should be open.
1 ||| I don't know where to start, the biscuit I keep hearing about is tasteless flat and dry, the chicken is soaked in oil. The cajun beans weren't bad though. Its just not my thing.
4 ||| This is the kind of gem that's off the beaten path and overlooked, but my wife and I had a great meal on the cheap, despite the late hour.
0 ||| DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  They were dispatched to my 5 year old condo TWICE in the last six weeks, and now the AIR CONDITIONER has mysteriously  BROKE again.  Naturally,  they want to charge me again for a 3rd repair in six weeks.  I don't think so!
1 ||| Clean, easy to navigate, and uncrowded.  However, you should plan on LOTS of walking when switching terminals!
4 ||| Freshest ingredients, authentic recipes and reasonably priced!!
4 ||| Been religiously coming here for 7 Years and refuse to go anywhere else for my Pedicures Manicures and waxing!!
3 ||| Hidden jewel since it's underground, it has somewhat of a romantic feel (all exclusive and what not). But what I will tell you is that their food is pretty good. I ordered some samosas as an appetizer. Normally I am picky with Samosas since I feel like they are under stuffed . BUT NOT HERE ! \n\nThe waitress recommended me Dorowot. Nice and spicy :) Just how I like my food ! \n\nAmazing service ! -- The waitress I had is such a cutie !\n\nPs. Madison's food options are scarce . Eat here . It's actually good ! Don't do decent .
0 ||| Garcia's has typical Mexican food, perhaps a bit better than Macayo's. Not authentic Mexican food, but adapted to what the typical American might like. At this location of Garcia's, the food was OK, but the service was not good at all. \n\nThe waitress couldn't give us guidance on drinks because she doesn't drink alcohol. The drink menu doesn't have any prices on it, so I asked her how much some of the drinks were, and she didn't know that either. She just gave me a price range of $5.95 \"on up\". I'm not interested in ordering a drink with no price, only to find out later that it cost more than my meal itself. I didn't take any chances that night. \n\nShe couldn't guide us on what to order on most of the dishes because she doesn't eat meat. With all the people looking for work, I'm surprised they couldn't find someone appropriate to wait tables here. Anyway, some of the drinks got there quickly, but the manager ran drinks over to the table about 5 minutes afterwards (perhaps she forgot about us). \n\nLater on at 845pm, they were running a noisy vacuum cleaner in the dining room on the other side of the room divider. This went on for several minutes, and I thought perhaps they had closed down that dining room for the night. But no! There was a still a table of people eating there. If it was annoying for us, imagine how they felt! \n\nJust overall a disappointing experience and I won't go back to this particular Garcia's again. There were plenty of empty tables on a Saturday night at 730pm, so perhaps others have decided the same?
0 ||| Don't eat here. 16 min stuck in drive through and once there is a car or two behind you your stuck for the whole crazy trip. 16 min two combos, I left with three large fries and a horrible tasting Chibatta burger, could not eat it. Also ordered a hamburger with no cheese and only ketchup.  I asked them to check to see if it had cheese on it and it did. So they replaced it with a large fries. Stay away. No big deal just pass this place.
1 ||| I ordered fish. Friend had brisket. It was uninspiring. And not much food. And pricey for that little food.
0 ||| Do you like it hot??\n\nI dont. Well lemme say, I like certain sandwiches warm and toasty but not one with avocado. We came here a while ago because I LOVE deli sandwiches. I have never been here so I was EXCITED. Like a virgins first lay I was let down : (\n\nI love any sandwich with avocado, alas its an add on so it more expensive so I opted for the turkey bacon club with avocado. They ask what size I want. So I pick the medium bc the small looked itty bitty, I opted for the combo but was kinda irritated when it was almost 9$! I think paying as much as a small steak dinner for a deli sandwich is preposterous! \n\nWe sat and waited for our meals, it took a little time (which was weird bc they werent even busy!) but our food finally came out . I grabbed my sandwich and felt it was warm and was like \"wtf?\" Im not a fan. The sandwich was meh and I was just over this place. I felt like I was eating a turkey burger bc of the round bun also, weird!!\n\n\nI will not come back, too expensive and the food wasnt worth the price!
0 ||| The best place for an artic swirl. :)
0 ||| Yelp kinda let me down on this one. I was not impressed with this place. The service wasn't that bad but could have been much much better. The silverware and glasses were super dirty and it kinda turned me off to the rest of the mess. The food wasn't bad, in fact it was exactly what I expected from the appearance. It was really greasy and not all that satisfying. In their defense I feel like I should have purchased the Alaskan Cod or a steak but I couldn't take the chance of it being shitty.
4 ||| Went here for the first time and had breakfast. The hashbrowns and pancakes were awesome. Can't wait to go back for lunch sometime.
3 ||| I am so hungry for one right now. I think they have some sort of deal where you can buy multiple dogs and sides for a deal. But it's a toss up what you get. I recommend buying a  Matt's Chicago Dog. Don't leave it up to chance.
0 ||| Left them a message to make an appointment--no return call. Went to the Tempe office instead, which was awesome!
0 ||| Really, really, really, ridiculously good pupusas.  Those of you who have never tried one before, for the love of all that is holy man try one! \n\nTip- rough neighborhood, may want to strap on a bulletproof vest before coming down. \nTip- entrance is in the back
4 ||| A neighborhood ethnic place in yet another ubiquitous strip mall. I thought the food was good and the owners charming. I had the lamb shank with vegetables and cous cous. I thought is was good not great. It needed more seasoning and I relied on some red spicy sauce we all passed around to give it dimension. If I am ever in that neck of the woods again, I would definitely try one of the tangines. \nWe need to support places like this and enjoy the diversity in our neighborhoods!
0 ||| Me and my partner has been bringing our adorable dog here since she was a pup and every time it has been pleasent except for today.......... Usually one of the nice girls cleans and trims our dog's nails and never once has there been an issue, but today some guy done her grooming and when we got in the car her nails look like they were butchered and she still smells the same........just for future reference they have lost my business
1 ||| My pasta tasted like rubber, I think they might have served me the display.  The crowd here was pretty rowdy and entertaining, but my dinner was no good.  I guess I don't enjoy mainstream bars like this one.  There are a lot of attractive people around, but I really didn't have a lot in common with the other patrons.  If you like kind of preppy establishments, you would enjoy this place..  It just isn't up my alley though.  I do have to say that it was clean and all of the employees know what they are doing though.
0 ||| Beware!  it seemed to me that most of the employees here didn't want to be here and one triage nurse was so rude and uncaring it was shocking.  Why would a person work in the health care field if they didn't want to help people?  I was told this is a training hospital.  We met a few nurses who were very nice and helpful, but they were few and far between.  One nurse was bragging how happy he was to be leaving in a week.  Once admitted we never even saw a doctor and had to sign an APA form before they would let us leave.  We were so happy to just get out of there.  When we received the bills a week later they were so expensive we thought maybe we had stayed at Johns Hopkins Hospital!  In my opinion, if you have a choice go somewhere else.
4 ||| Love this place! Tina for pedi and Te for nails and wax. I am a regular and they are  always pleasant , quick, and clean. Give them a try!
3 ||| I love Hooters for drinks. They are all kind of the same on food. The wings are good. The waitresses are the real reason to go. This one has really good looking ones for the most part. There are a few fat ones, but that's how it goes. They seem to keep them on the day shift and let the talent work at nights.\n\nCheck them out on Wednesdays for 32oz Coors Lights for only 3 bucks. The Smothered Chicken sandwich is delicious. As Hooters restaurants go this one is slightly above average.
4 ||| Came in. My car died.\n\nThey jumped it.\n\nI accidentally turned it off. Looked like an idiot.\n\nGot the battery replaced at AutoZone, came back here.\n\nThey were still as friendly as ever.\n\nI always feel like anything car related --sales, repair, accessories-- is just a big opportunity to be scammed. It's like my lack of knowledge intimidates me. But at Sounds Good to Me, the crew was just awesome. Friendly every step of the way. Repaired my feedback issue with the head unit, and they did it at a great price. Especially considering I tried doing it myself and it's like someone attacked Jumanji with electric tape.\n\nSuper friendly. Great prices. Will come back for my other car audio needs.
3 ||| I always love Red Robin... Their crispy chicken salad is definitely my favorite, and their burgers will never, ever let you down. This particular location was alright-- large, clean, nice service, but nothing special.
4 ||| I love me some Home Depot!!!!  I can always find what I am looking for, and if I can't, someone is always 2 steps away and can help me!! \n\nThe store layout is easy to navigate. It's as clean as a Home Depot can be. Employees are awesome. I prefer to come here vs Lowes. Ugh.. Hate that place. \n\nFind me here at least once a week - usually withy iPod blasting as I breeze through the store finding what I need.\n\nEvery first Saturday of the month is a cool kids building mornings. It's free - again, where Lowes fails, they charge!
4 ||| So, I was hanging out with a friend on this side of town and we decided to grab some food, and we ended up here, at Chili's on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor starters, the place wasn't to busy, which was greati. After reviewing the menu, I realized they had happy hour specials all day long in Sunday. Bonus!  They had a nice but small selection of alcoholic beverages to choose from, but since I was driving, I had to pass on those. Notated that in the future, I can come here any given sunday and get some food and booze for cheap!\n\nI went with the buffalo wings and the free happy hour chips, and my friend got the triple plate where you could sample a few things, which he liked. It actually looked really good!  Drinks were always topped off and full, along with the few other requests that we had, like extra ranch dressing and some napkins.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, but I felt a bit rushed at the end.  The server was polite and all, but he asked us like 3 times of we were done. Um, yes, and no, I don't want my food cleared right away! He gave us our bill and we sat there for a bit. I mean, it wasn't busy so there wasn't a wait or anything and I don't know what his hurry was. \n\nSince I'm stuffed beyond words, I would say it was actually a really nice experience overall.  They had a few different games on the TV's throughout the bar, so that was a nice distraction during our lunch/dinner.\n\nOverall, not a half bad experience. What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and I really enjoyed my time here.
3 ||| This lady's showin' her age.  For a Hilton, it doesn't measure up.  The rooms are decent, the desk was friendly, the bathroom is clean and updated but it's really not much more than a Hampton.  As a Diamond HHonors member, I'm on the Executive level which helps, but not much.  The breakfast is mediocre, but free. \n\nAt $200/night (non-corporate rate), keep driving.\n\nIf it matters, I stayed at the Crown Plaza at 44th and Washington and had a very similar impression.
1 ||| Took the kid to spend some quality time and avoid dishes.  He loves pizza so I figured we would try this place.  Walk in around 5:30pm and its empty on a Saturday night (not a great sign). The host invites us to alert our own table. There was a bartender chatting with patrons. The host brought us our menu and drinks then two more people came in.  She got them drinks and a menu. 1 person came in for his order out pizza and she helped him with that.  A second person walked in for their order out pizza.  She then came to us and got our order. I got chicken noodle soup and the kid got a kids pizza. I also ordered the pizza rolls because a friend told me once they were very good.  I helped Gio with his pizza and find that the crust was hard to cut. It was a gummy texture.  I felt bad for him, but luckily he's just a kid and doesn't realize his pizza was no good. Soup was good.  They brought this big circle loaf thing of bread. Didn't touch it. Seems like a waste. The rolls were good, they had ham slices in there. I took them to my mom to enjoy. Won't be back. Not worth it.
0 ||| While my dogs looked and smelled awesome and they did the cuts exactly how I wanted, my yorkie came home with 3 small cuts on her (one on top of each wrist and one on her stomach).  I know she can squirm, but I was not made aware of these injuries and the one on her stomach is obvious! I'm really disappointed because this groomer was close to my house and the staff was wonderful.   Needless to say by omitting that this happened,  I will not return.
4 ||| I have been meaning to get my hair cut for a while but I've been apprehensive.  I used to have a great stylist in Glendale an was wanting the same pride in workmanship.  I went to a different salon on this side of town but didn't like it very much. The shop was really nice it's just that my stylist didn't listen to what I asked for.  I decided to try Pure Elements because it was new and the reviews are really good.  I called to see if there were any openings and the had one for thirty minutes after I called.  I took an appointment with Lexi.  I hope that's how you spell her name.  But she was awesome!  A real joy to talk to and she did everything I asked with my hair.  Ben when she was finished she asked how I liked it and I had a minor change but she took care of it immediately.  I absolutely love my hair cut!!!!
4 ||| Sweet Tomatoes is the buffet for anybody who is trying to work at eating healthier (or not).  Though it's primarily a salad bar, and you can get all your veggies fresh and well-presented, the wealth of other items enables you to come with a differently-motivated companion, even a carnivore.\n\nYou can be good with a selection of three prepared chopped salads, and/or create your own with spinach, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, jicama, carrots, kidney beans, chick peas, sweet peas, corn, hard-boiled egg, radishes, raisins, crumbled blue cheese, shredded cheese, tomatoes, dill pickles, sweet pickles, onions, sprouts, bell peppers, chili peppers, croutons, bacon bits, sweet raisin broccoli salad, and a dozen different dressings.\n\nOr, you can be not so good with mac-and-cheese, or stir fried pasta and vegetables, or a baked white or sweet potato, or eight different soups such as cream of broccoli, navy bean, mushroom, clam chowder or big chunk chicken so loaded with chicken that the meat eaters can fill a bowl just with white meat.\n\nOr, you can be really bad with garlic asiago focaccia bread, or four cheese pizza or pepperoni pizza or muffins, and corn bread.\n\nFinally test your will power with tapioca pudding, frozen yogurt, brownies, hot fudge and caramel sauce, or fruit and jello.\n\nI go because it makes me think I'm being good, then give in to 2000 calories of temptations every time.
4 ||| Can I say anything bad about phat burrito? No I can't. Nothing beats a bbq chicken burrito. The food is fresh and flavorful. The salsa bar has a great variety and the service is chill and laid back. Just found out they are serving breakfast now too. \nOnly advice I have is try to avoid this place during peak hours. Other than that you're always in for a treat.
4 ||| Mining Camp was an annual tradition growing up in Apache Junction. Though I live in Los Angeles now, I try to make it back to Mining Camp once every year or two.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the main all-you-can-eat family-style meal is exactly the same as it was when I first ate there 25+ years ago. The beef ribs are excellent. They're the kind of ribs that are slathered in barbecue sauce, so if you're looking for more of a Texas-style smoked rib, you won't find it here. The sauce is delicious, though, and the ribs are perfectly moist and tasty. Other meats include chicken with gravy and stuffing, and ham with a pineapple glaze. Both are good, but the real attraction for me is the ribs.\n\nSides offered with the meal are abundant: potato wedges, green beans, baked beans, rolls and raisin bread. All are good, but my favorites are the giant fluffy rolls and the baked beans. The meal used to include drinks-- I think it was just tea, lemonade, water and coffee. The last time I went, though, drinks were an extra $2.50, and they also offered soda and alcohol. I'm guessing this is thanks to the recent opening of Dutchman's Hideout next door, where they have a full bar.\n\nThey also offer steaks, a couple seafood options and even a veggie plate as alternatives to the classic family-style meal. These are not offered all the time, so be sure to check ahead with the restaurant if you plan on ordering one of those. For a while, I would order a steak when I came here, and they were pretty good, but I think from now on, I'll be back to the ribs, etc.\n\nAll I've been talking about so far is the food, but another major draw of the restaurant is its ambiance. Situated in the foothills of the majestic Superstition Mountains and featuring a fun theme and occasional live music, the restaurant is perfect for everyone: young, old, couples, families. Locals, tourists and winter visitors all frequent the place, and have been keeping it in business for 50-odd years.\n\nBe aware that the restaurant is seasonal, closing for the hot summer months. Make sure it's open before you go!
4 ||| There's something about going to a club that ALWAYS has people (both women and men) that find you hot.... hehehe.\n\nSo Club 5 gets TOP STARS in my vote.\n\nThe drinks are HELLA cheap, and LOADED (and not with gasoline quality vodka like everywhere in State Street).\n\nThere's PLENTY of dancing area, you dont' have to bump with the person next door.\n\nAnd they play PLENTY of oldies like Madonna and Cher and Tina (isn't it sad that I'm calling Madonna old?  That means I'M old... Well.. Old School that is...\n\nThis is NOT for the prude and conservative (*cough*WIers*cough) as it's a gay club.  But if you want good drinks, good dance, and be able to hang out with MANY of your friends at the same time, this is the place...
2 ||| Add me to the chorus of people who do not understand the effusive praise this place receives from the majority of Yelp reviewers.\n\nI've been here twice. Both times, the food was solid, but nothing special. I tried the flautas the first time, and a combo plate with chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and beef taco on the second visit. They do give you a lot of food absolutely smothered in cheese, and the prices are moderate. (Doubtful you're getting out of here for under $10/person after tax and tip.) The margaritas are $1.75, but of course very small and full of ice...I wouldn't expect anything different at that price. The horchata is delicious and made with real milk.\n\nSo the food is okay, maybe slightly above average. The service seems to be hit-or-miss. The first time I went, I sat at the bar and the service was great and friendly. The second time, however, I brought my girlfriend and we sat at a table. The server couldn't have been much more rude - he was extremely short with us. He basically acted like we were wasting his time and was not friendly at all. The younger guys did come around and keep our chips and salsa well-stocked, but it couldn't make up for the attitude we got from the server in my mind. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but you shouldn't take that out on your customers in any circumstance.\n\nAverage food and hit-or-miss service makes Mi Patio a 3-star locale...I really can't imagine rating them any higher.
2 ||| I have not been there in years, but we had a family get together and pizza won.  We got our table and the server took a few minutes to get there. No big deal.\n\nProblem - I went to the rest room and almost gagged.  The WORST smelling restroom I had ever been in; it smelled like a port-a-john in July.  Ugh, so bad.  \n\nThe waiter was nice guy, he joked with the kids and kept the drinks full.  Not unusual, but I noticed he did not write anything down when the 10 of us were giving our orders.  I've had plenty of servers in the past who have just taken our order by memory.  The key is, ya gotta remember that order correctly.  Clearly he did not as the veggie pizza had 3 meats on it.  oops.  \n\nThat being said, the pizzas were fantastic and the beers were cheap.  $2 for domestic and $3 for craft beers; ya cant beat that.\n\nI'd go back again. I just would not use their restroom again....ever!
2 ||| Thin walls. Rooms with no tubs - just showers. ...Small TV - with no pay -per-view options. ...My room was clean and staff was efficient.
2 ||| I've flown out of this airport for quite a while now, since I have lived in Phoenix for several years, and I have to say, its quite a nice airport.  Sky Harbor has three Terminals, (terminal 2, 3 and 4) but it seems that most people fly out of Terminal 3 and 4...well, at least I have.  Plus, since I've had several family members and friends come in and out, I've had really positive experiences picking them up as well.\n\nMy most recent visit was to Terminal 3, and it was really fun and easy getting in and out of here. I was dropped off by a friend, went inside and checked my luggage.  Security was easy, and off to my flight I went.  Plenty of places to eat and hang out in here, plus you get free wifi at the airport!  I hate running down my battery, so I try to plug it in when and where I can.  More challanging to find a plug if the airports busy, but its big enough to find one if you really scour.\n\nI also like that theres plenty of places to eat in AND out of the security area.  Makes waiting for a flight much easier, because if I want a cup of coffee, bagel, or something more substantial, I don't have to go through security to get it.  I've taken a few friends to the airport, parked the car, and gone in and had a quick bite to eat with them before their flight takes off.  I've also helped my mom navigate this place as well for when she gets into town so she knows where shes going.  My dad? not so much.  He prefers to navigate his own way.  LOL.\n\nThere's also rental car counters in here as well, who will help you get into a vehicle when you arrive.  love it!\n\nBaggage claim here is quick.  I mean, its FAST.  Be prepared to get off your flight and go directly to get your bags, otherwise your gonna be late getting them!  Also, there's plenty of ground transportation here, so you can grab a taxi, super shuttle or what not to get a ride home in case you do not have one.  \n\nEven though I have never used it, there's also plenty of on and off site parking here as well.  Off site is obviously cheaper, and most of the spots have coupons along with regular shuttles to and from the lots to the terminals.  I also like how the light rail connects to Sky Harbor as well.\n\nLove you sky harbor, keep up the good work!
0 ||| I was not pleased with the service that I received and I was not satisfied with the value. I highly prefer the Pineville location.
4 ||| Just like a good man, a good tailor is hard to find. But, I've heard such good things about Anna's Alterations that I just had to bring in a need-to-be-altered item and see what they were all about. \n\nRight off of Park Rd, Anna's is a spacious, airy shop with sky blue walls and tons of dressing & alterations areas. When I walked in with my way too long dress in hand, they promptly greeted me and asked me if I needed to try the dress on. Indeed I did and I hopped into a dressing room. 15 minutes later after expert pinning and a bit of friendly discussion regarding the length I was looking for, I was out the door with a claim ticket in hand. The dress I brought in needed to be taken up about 6 inches and the bottom band needed to be shortened and reattached. It would be ready in 5 days and when I asked the cost, they checked in the back (with the tailors, I assume) and replied it would be around $16. \n\nFast forward 5 days and the dress fits perfectly. Elation aside, $16 for that perfectly done alteration is a great deal. And since Anna's is so conveniently located next to J Major's Bridal and some great consignment stores (Monarch, JT Posh) it's the perfect stop to get all of your clothes fitting just right.
4 ||| Excellent and interesting Chinese food! Its not fancy, but has a nice Asian ambiance,  and is inexpensive for sure. I've only been a handful of times and everything has always been delicious but this last time on New Years Day I had the szechuan prawns. Omg. Amazing!!!! Huge portion and the sauce was spicy tangy sweet and perfect.
3 ||| I've been here three times now, and have zero complaints about the food. People are right when they say the chicken noodle soup here is amazing! When I've come for lunch I've ordered half a sandwich and soup - the portions are huge! It's a great value. The waiter always seems to recommend Challah bread, so that is what I've gotten and it has been really good. Also, I had some sort of brisket eggs benedict - again, the portions are huge, I think I took almost half of it home. And the brisket was very tasty and tender - exactly what you'd expect from a delicatessen. \n\nThe downside is that there can be a wait and they don't seem to keep a list. You just have to stand around at the door until they get to you. And people aren't really standing in a straight line because there is limited space. It would make things much easier if they just took down names and let people wait outside. (I guess you could always order your food at the take out counter.)\n\nSpeaking of outside, when the weather is nice they serve at the outdoor tables too. So this place is dog friendly! Just beware, you still have to wait your turn in that line to get an outdoor table.
4 ||| Great setting. Big restaurant but great service. Mediterranean. Halibut was killer - in a soup.  Major dipping action.  A gem!
4 ||| I'm a sucker for charming places and this is one of them. It's a perfect place for a date, girls lunch or dinner with mom. I live and work near here and can't believe I didn't try it until Spring Restaurant Week! \n\nI loved loved loved everything I ate. I had the ceasar salad and the filet Mignon which was glazed with a delicate wine port sauce - so good that I ate every bite! And I'm super picky about ceasar salads and this was the best one I've ever had. I had the creme brulee for dessert which I didn't love, but everything else made up for it. \n\nI looked at their menu recently since I've been wanting to come back and these items don't appear to be on there - I guess they were a special for Restaurant Week. Kind of a bummer but definitely won't stop me from returning. \n\nWith the charming atmosphere, delish dinner and BYOB option - this place has it all!
0 ||| When people say, \"The Cheesecake Factory\", what I hear is \"The Diarrhea Refinery\".
1 ||| We were the unfortunate recipients of $200 in Romano's gift cards, so we've eaten there a few times recently. The birthday dinner we had was ok. We started with some of their new appetizers. Pass on them. The pesto bean bruschetta lacked flavor (where was the pesto??) and should have been served warm. The peppers were ok. The stuffed mushrooms were just boring. Our entrees came next. I had a pumpkin ravioli, which was quite good. Hubby got the trio and didn't even bring the spaghetti home. He said it was terrible. Birthday dessert was chocolate cake--it was so bland it went uneaten. The canoli weren't worth it, either.\n\nWe went back on a Saturday night. Was told there was a 45 minute wait. After 45 minutes they started seating people who ARRIVED AFTER US. When I complained, she said they had a reservation. I call bullsh-t on that. Then they seated ANOTHER group that arrived after us. Then she said there were 7 more parties before us. I told her to look around--there weren't 7 parties left to be seated. I was pissed. There was no apology. And no one over the age of 35 to complain too.\n\nOur waiter was Aaron. it took him 8 minutes to greet us. We asked him three times for water for the table. We never received the promised plate to share our woefully under-dressed salad. I had the salmon entree and hubby had the porkchop. Both were cooked beautifully (and I had asked for the salmon pretty rare)--really perfect. Too bad they had NO FLAVOR. It was such a shame. It was a terrible dinner, over all...\n\nF--- me, I still have $40 to spend. Hubby and I went several years ago and loved it. What happened??
2 ||| I ordered sweet and sour chicken along with sasame chicken to go. . The food was alright but nothing to brag about.\nThe crab puffs were pretty good. Spent over $33 for those three items. I expected more for the price.
2 ||| We sat outside since it was a nice night. There was a party of 10 outside that immediately started doing shots. Add that to the fact that 5 of them were smoking and it took away from the experience. Our server did his best but was a bit overwhelmed from the large party. And was asked to take photos by 3 different tables. Tacky on the patrons part. He was clearly struggling as it was. The food was good, even though one of our orders was wrong. We chalked it up and took it. It was close. Fajita chimmichonga instead of just chicken. Still was good. Would definitely go back.
1 ||| No tacos!!!! without the tacos...... I won't be back but loved the tacos.......I used to rate it 5 stars... The taco sauce was great too... You could still taste them four hours later.  the line out the door unless you show up before 11 am. the lack of parking. cash only. nasty falling apart tables with zero shade unless you want to sit under that tree on fresh bird shit. No more tacos. No more Ritos. I had this stupid friend from New Hampshire  who tried to go at night and a cop asked him what the hell was he thinking? The cop said get the hell out of here! It was testament to how good the tacos were though.
0 ||| I came here very excited to order my favorite vietnamese soup called Hu Tieu..  I asked them to include meatballs and the server told me \"No, does not come with meatball\" .. Ok.. not the end of the world. The soup came, it was delicious and I was almost done when suddenly I saw a very bright blue, thin, rubber band swimming in my noodles!  YUM! :-(  My husband got the waiters attention and we showed him the rubber band. He did not apologize, but reacted upset and immediately started speaking loudly to the other staff and then looked to my husband and asked if I wanted a new bowl. I did NOT want a new bowl.. I had immediately lost my appetite. But to my surprise when we went to check out, they did not give us the soup for a discount or even offer a slight apology! Later, when I told the story to my friends.. I was informed a similar situation had happened to them also, except I should be glad It was only a rubber band, because they found a cigarette in their soup!
0 ||| I DO NOT recommend getting an oil change here.  My wife has taken our car here two times. Each time she has been tricked into buying services that are unneeded. \n\nJust last week, she took our car there for an oil change. While there, our car would not start so the employees gave her a jump start. When she brought the car home I noticed that there was acid seeping out of the top of the battery. The employees did not mention this and we could see where they had attached the cables to the acid burned part of the battery. \n\nI also noticed that the coolant tank was completely empty. WTF?\n\nWoodman's East is a much better place to get an honest oil change.
0 ||| I used to find Guy Fieri of \"Diners Drive-Ins and Dives\" mildly amusing, but when I discovered that he is promoting a place like Thee Pitts Again and bypassing true local gems like LoLo's and Welcome Diner, I decided he needs a palate check. \n\nHubby and I actually went after seeing it on the show, in spite of the piggy kitsch factor. The zucchini app was mushy on the inside and crispy on the outside (due to too much greasy tempura, in my opinion). My pulled pork was acceptable, but the ribs were scant on meat and drowning in sauce. I got the waiter to spill the beans on the mashed potatoes- 1/2 real and 1/2 instant, and they were so garlicky they were acrid. Hubby got the only moderately tasty thing we ordered- the pork tenderloin. Two HUGE pieces breaded in the same tempura as the zucchini- very moist, somewhat bland, and definitely a heart attack waiting to happen. We took the second piece home and split it for dinner the next day. Hubby liked his potato salad well enough, and the cornbread was OK in taste but very crumbly and therefore hard to eat.\n\nNo need for us to return.
0 ||| This company put the wrong size fan motor in our air conditioner because he didn't want to drive across town to get the correct one. Lazy, crooked and awful. I would never do business with these people again!
0 ||| Slowest service I've ever had in my life. Took 20 minute for a waitress to come to our table. It wasn't even a waitress... The hostess was the one who helped us. Took 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered. Spent 2 hours in the place... Wasn't even crowded. Food was good that is about it.  We asked for a discount and what did we get... 10%. We saved 2 dollars after spending 2 hours of our time there.  Was awesome to be sitting next to the mom who had a shirt that said I run so I don't kill people as she made her kid cry by force feeding him broccoli at 10pm.
0 ||| Desperate for something healthy in the area, I thought KFC might have some decent grilled chicken. They did not have grilled chicken off the bone, but had the grilled version on the bone. It was decent, maybe supermarket quality, but that is not what they are know for making best obviously. Cole slaw and biscuit do not need a review, but the staff is kinda dumb at this location. My two piece white meal ended up including a thigh and breast. I was in a rush and I would not have eaten the wing anyway, but I thought it was two piece white is two breasts. Oh well, i left my personal message on the table in protest in the form of overturned slaw cup, immature, but effective in teaching a non-verbal lesson.
2 ||| Good overall\n\nI'm torn about our convention center here in Phoenix. Lots of positives and negatives, frankly.\n\nPros: Wide open and soaring spaces; Upstairs areas have good views of the city; A/C keeps you uber cool; A few good restaurants in reasonable walking distance (during cooler seasons); Relatively nice staff; Pretty nice architecture\n\nCons: Inside eateries are expensive for middling-quality food; Parking can be fairly expensive, especially if you are there for a multi-day event; Parking can be far, which means sweating through your attire in hotter seasons; Downtown Phoenix is mid-way through developing a nice downtown atmosphere and lacks nice areas to relax or draw your interest; Odd spread of convention facilities means finding the north versus south buildings BEFORE you park, so you don't have a long hike\n\nOnce downtown develops draws that keep families and young professionals in downtown, there will be more to make the Convention Center's setting more appealing.  Then just solve the parking trek + cost issue and this place is exceptional
1 ||| Very personable staff, but slow. Their cellphones are very important to them.  The food wasn't anything to write home about, overly greasy and not at all fresh. \n\nI have never had a problem with their fries, but today they were not crispy, but super soggy. NOT good. I had a sandwich, and my meal-mate had wings. Neither of us were happy and will not be back.
4 ||| Day 2 of Az Restaurant week fared sooo much better! We made reservations at Top of the Rock. We had been there about five years ago for some occasion....birthday or something. We remembered it being good and the view to be fabulous...and we were not disappointed once again. We were seated immediately and our server (Rod) was friendly and had a good sense of humor. He was thrilled we were there for Restaurant week (good start!) \nMy husband started with the seared Ahi and I had the Gnocchi. Both tasted fabulous and the presentation was lovely! Our main courses (he had lamb, I had salmon) were also terrific. My salmon was perfectly cooked with an interesting chutney like topping and asparagus. Yum. And for desert we had bananas foster and the molten lava chocolate cake! Now THIS was a fabulous menu and so worth the price! Obviously Top of the Rock was showcasing their wares and wanted us to come back! And we will!
2 ||| I was recently in Phoenix with my husband for business. Although our hotel had a workout facility, I prefer classes over treadmills. We love our YMCA so I thought I would find a local YMCA near our hotel. Chris town YMCA was the closest and I could visit 5 times for free. I got a copy of their class schedule. Total Body Conditioning was listed! Perfect! At home, this is a 45 class that whips my butt weekly. We work every muscle group plus add cardio and by the time class is over, I am dripping wet. But I've learned that not all YMCA's are alike- nor are the classes- even though they are called the same thing. I realize now that Phoenix is a huge retirement community. I was the youngest by far of anyone in the class. It didn't start on time, it lasted 1 hour and when it was over, I did not need a shower! We did a lot of work on our balance- which is important I suppose in your 70's. I'm not trying to be rude- the people were very friendly and kind. It just wasn't the experience I was expecting. Needless to say, I did not go back. If you are 50 or under, fit and active and looking for a place to work-out while in the area, look elsewhere.
3 ||| Charlie's is not my favorite place, but I go a lot because I have a ton of friends who like to go.  There is something going on at Charlie's.  Whether it be strippers on Monday nights or Pussy LeHoot and friends on Sunday.  \n\nThe bartenders pour a strong beverage, so be ready!  Drinks are three for one on Sunday afternoons, and two for one on Thursday evenings.\n\nThere are three other Charlie's locations too.  Las Vegas, Denver, and Chicago.  I have also been to Charlie's Denver.  I believe that Phoenix has the biggest one of the four.  Huge dance floor, plenty of space inside. Out back the patio is colossal! There is a volleyball court back there too!\n\nOne of my favorite things about Charlie's is the taco stand!  They have the best tacos and burritos ever!  Tacos are small and only a buck each...perfect for a snack.  the burrito is five bucks and worth it!  You can get food inside the back patio or directly from Camelback.\n\nI recommend coming on a Sunday night.  Have a taco or burrito and see Pussy LeHoot!
4 ||| 20% off of the entire purchase for Black Friday. The specials were only 6 AM to noon though. I can say I love it that the managers always let you know that there is a 100% quality guarantee or you may exchange at any time.
0 ||| Please arrowhead mall stop filling up the bottom floor like its Tijuana. I hate going to this mall now because every few feet I have people yelling at me trying to get my attention to buy their goods at their kiosk. I have 4 hair straighteners already! I do not need you to straighten my hair. No I don't want your diamond makeup! I am not interested in a time share or phone case. Please leave me alone! My whole shopping experience is ruined and I would rather just go to Amazon.
2 ||| The atmosphere is great. The prices are right. The wine-a-ritas are different, tasty but just ok. The local wines are a bit light, I prefer CA wines but they were still good, a bit over priced. I would have bought the pinot grigio but didn't think it was worth $25. I would go again and definitly will order the flight for $6. Pick any 6 for $6. whatta deal!
3 ||| Great bartenders, always has a crowd at night. Thursday nights are 50cent drafts, but you have to be sure to get there before it runs out. Definitely a JWU hangout on Thursdays. Also a great place to head after alive after five
4 ||| Thank you for bringing some REAL African culture to the Queen City.  Shame on you Queen City for not knowing about this hidden gem...props to Mama Africa...mother of ALL civilization.  I loved the atmosphere, danced to African drums playing from a radio in the background, chatted with the sister about Juneteenth and burning sage to eliminate negative energy.  My husband loves the chewing sticks, I love my earrings...We will frequent this place as often as possible...
0 ||| They no longer have a flower shop.  I went in looking for a BIG \"vase\" to hold a big bunch of flowers.  After poking around for a couple minutes I asked an employee for such.  He walked me over to another woman who repeated my request a couple times (a vase?  a VASE?).  Ok, wft woman, I have a bunch of flowers for my dad's memorial service, I've got 10 minutes to find something to put them in before I shove them up your a$$.  Yes, I was a little stressed.  She went in to this long thing about how they didn't have a flower shop any more and they might have a few in the back but they weren't priced to sell.  I interrupted her and said, \"So the answer is no?\"  I asked twice.  She wouldn't give me an answer.  I started walking out.  There were a bunch of, forgive me, \"Hurricane glasses\" which would suit my needs just marvy.  I picked one up and started looking around for something better.  Bitch woman saw me and said, \"Oh, well, we DO have CANDLEHOLDERS\".  Didn't offer to help me anymore.  I made a point of picking up just about every single one I could find.  Apparently, \"vase\" is a technical term reserved for something very special.\nAnyway, I bought something and ended up returning it the next day because the same thing at Cost Plus was $9 rather than $27.\nPoor service, high prices, crappy selection.  Fail.
0 ||| Very fancy and somewhat spookey!
0 ||| This place is small, run down, and smells like rotting dog poop (seriously, even the bed sheets reeked)! We stayed here because a friend hooked us up with two free rooms for the weekend. It wasn't all that bad but that's mainly because we didn't spend too much time in our room as it was. \n\nWhile we never made it down to the pool I'd say that's probably their only redeeming quality. (Cool fire pits, water falls and lighted pools at night). \n\nThe room service was fast but the food was barely edible. The freezer burned fries were nuked in the microwave for about two minutes and arrived floppy and cold. The chicken was smothered with melted Kraft singles cheese and the bread was stale and tasteless. \n\nGreat that this stay was free but I'd never in a million years pay to stay here!
0 ||| **BEWARE THIS CAR WASH**\nI recently visited this car wash and it caused $300.00 of damage to my car through its \"touchless wash\".\nActually broke my windshield! I immediately drove my car around the building to show the attendant the damage. He agreed the vehicle was damaged and stated \"it definately could have been done in the wash\". He said i needed to call the owner of the wash to discuss the damage. I called the \"owner\" of the car wash \"David\", which so happens to be the first Yelp comment on here???? Hmmm.\nAnyway David was very unprofessional and immediately went on the defense stating there was \"no way his car wash could cause damage\". He was very un-pleasent, and un-ruley, and unreasonable to say the very least! He would not listen to any issues one of \"his\" customers legitimately had!\nNot to mention (that it matters at this point) it was a horrible wash, leaving your car still dirty anyway..\nBottom line folks.... This low-dollar, ghetto car wash will leave you very unsatisfied, and certainly all on your own if you should (god forbid) ever have an issue there!\nIt cost me a car wash and $300.00 out of my very own pocket to fix his car washes mistake and malfunction! \nThey take ZERO liability and ZERO responsibility for their own fault even with 100% of fact its their fault.\nTheir lucky it was only a windshield or else this Yelp comment would have been linked to the civil lawsuit filed!\n\nThink before visiting any of the \"Wash Around The Clock Car Washes\"! Save your money and visit a differant wash that actually CARES FOR IT CUSTOMERS!\n\nThank you for listening folks and God Bless.
0 ||| Why I even bothered to return to this mess hall for breakfast is beyond me.  First of all, I take back about what I said about their breakfast.  I ordered the country breakfast, two eggs, two sausages, 2 pieces of bacon and two pancakes.  The pancakes were horrid, they were so hard you can play baseball with them.  Needless to say, the help has turned into an I don't know what.  One of the waitresses apparently just gave birth, good, I am happy for her.  So the owner is waiting on tables.  Without warning, she approaches our table all giggly and laughing, \"Sara just had her baby.\"  Then she goes from table to table, \"Sara just had her baby, it's a girl, c-section.\"  Oh please.  First of all, I did not ask about a baby or someone's pregnancy or child birth.  I came to your diner to eat not to hear about some woman's labor and delivery experience.  Diner beware, the owner is nuts.  Most people do not want to hear about childbirth over a meal.
0 ||| This place is hella ghetto and nasty. I order a burger with NO onions and they put onions, the bad thing is that i told them about it so they could fix it but all they did was pick the onions off. Never going back again
0 ||| Bamboo Club Asian Bistro is a corporate chain of about 10 restaurants, most in AZ, trying to capitalize on the success of that other AZ HQ chain, PF Chang's. The formula is provide Panda Express food in an upscale \"Bistro\" environment, add table service and a bar, so you can charge more to ignorant Americans who love their sweet and sour pork in a CPK like atmosphere, then expand to locations and sales to eventually go public and cash out before the trend fades. Someone took me to the upscale Biltmore Shopping Center one in Phoenix. I could do better in any Chinatown.
4 ||| I started going to this place in 1984 when I was in 3rd grade. It was a reward for getting good grades. I remember getting cheeseburger gyros and thinking they were the best thing ever. Sadly the cheeseburger is long gone.  Then I left for college and made sure to hit gyro time every timer I made it home for holidays.   And now as an adult I make sure to stop in every now and then.\n\nI now order the gyro with no onions, add feta cheese, and throw some hot sauce on it.  Delicious every time...\n\nThe guy who I think is the owner is in there  about half the time I'm there. He is a nice guy who is alway willing to have a conversation and seems to enjoy being there.... I have tried the Cheyenne location (way closer to my house) but it just isn't the same for some reason...   I am going to chalk that up to childhood memories.....\n\nAll and all this is a good place to grab lunch and take a stroll down memory lane for me....   I can't wait to take my daughter there one day when they bring back the cheeseburger gyro and she earns a trip there with her good grades....
0 ||| I have been an advocate of Banker Insulation since 2007 when they did some insulation work for my Garage in Surprise. Did a great job and couldn't be happier. In 2011, they did it again to our home in Goodyear. Great job again. Decided to use them at our business location in Goodyear, why wouldn't we. The actual job of removing the old insulation and installing the new looks great. But prior to the insulation job, we had the epoxy floors done so keeping them nice was critical. The sales manager suggested some boots for the lift so that the lift didn't cause issues with the floor. Sounds great to me. After the job was done, the floors were scraped and scratched and it did not look like either of the lifts had any boots on them. I do not know how they got scraped up, whether is what the lifts supports, staples on the floors and turning on them, I really don't care what did it. I just wanted them to be exactly how they were. Come to find out, that boots/diapers are for the bottom of the lifts, not for the tires, so that the lifts do not leak oil on the floors. That was not made known until after we were trying to come to problem solving answer. My $10,000+ epoxy floors don't look like $10,000+ floors any longer. They would rather say that it was not their fault when no one else is in the shop while they are working then keep a continued customer happy. $750 out of a $6000+ invoice, It is really sad. Am I an advocate now? I can't. If they come back and offer to fix the floor, I would say that they did the right thing and would become an advocate for them again.
4 ||| Postino is one of my FAVORITE restaurants I have ever been to.  I always make sure to be very hungry when I go.  I can't say enough good things about it so I will try to be as concise as possible.\n\nMy friends and I usually go on Friday and Saturday nights and it is understandably busy.  We all usually grab a delicious glass of wine and don't mind the short wait at all.  I cannot say enough nice things about the staff here.  They are always very polite, friendly, and conscious of getting us seated as soon as possible.\n\nWe always order one or two planks of bruschetta to start out.  I have had them all and love them equally.  To follow that I usually order the prosciutto and brie panini.  All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious (I have to admit I am picky about bread, coming from San Francisco sourdough land) I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well.\n\nThe food is amazing.  The service could not be better.  The ambiance is nice and casual. The price is more than reasonable.  I have no criticisms for this restaurant and encourage everyone to go!
4 ||| If you're looking to hit the patron train wreck jackpot- stop in to Irene's any day of the week.  I will definitely be back to watch mistresses and first dates happen.\n\nThe bartenders are charismatic and actually know what it means to be a bartender. They have multiple locations, but I've only been to this one.
0 ||| This review is for \"The Tower\"...the Wigwam's poolside bar. We ordered drinks and food throughout the day for 4 days.  3 out of the 4 days they would add items to my tab or charge us incorrectly for more expensive items (i.e. we ordered 2 hamburgers one day- bill said 4 hamburgers, first day there we ordered and they first brought us guacamole and chips so we thought it comes with the meal- nope they just added that onto the bill even though no one ordered them. We paid for the chips even though we didn't order them. One day we ordered 2 shots of their house tequila- they charged us for the nicer tequila).  When we would point it out to them at the end of the day they would correct it, but it was pretty shady that this kept happening.  My aunt didn't even check her bill to make sure it was correct- so they could do it to people and just get more money out of them.  3 out of 4 days on my bill....seems like a scam of some sort to me.
2 ||| A bit out of the way and a super casual place. All of that doesn't bother us but rating is reduced due to overall lack of friendliness and guest service by those working. It wasn't very busy and we basically were ignored while we tried to figure out where to order, how to find utensils, etc. We never found the barbeque sauce either which might have also improved the rating.  \n\nOn to the food, we split a three meat combo with brisket, ribs, and pulled pork with the cornbread, baked beans and potato salad. We ate there at the covered tables near the misters and even at 3 pm and 100 degrees, it really was very bearable to eat.  The ribs were well flavored but only one was super tasty, tender. That one definitely earned rave reviews. The brisket was tender and meaty but no real smoke or barbeque seasoning. Maybe sauce would have changed our minds but least favorite item on the plate.  The pulled pork was great, small amount of sauce mixed in and was tender and flavorful. As for the sides, cornbread was good, slight sweet; potato salad was mild and creamy and tasted good, best side however was the beans, slightly sweet with good amount of sauce and meat. \n\nThe food is good enough for us to go back again but would love to see a bit more friendly atmosphere.
1 ||| Server not intuitive but friendly and courteous.   Table side guacamole was blah, no flavor.   My son did not like the chicjen tenders on the kids menu.  I think the batter was the same as you would use on fush sticjs.  We added more jalapeno and it didn't help.  My salmon was dry snd overly lemon flavored.   Watermelon Cooler was good.
2 ||| This is a relatively big, warehouse-y looking place that has decent prices but average sushi.  Good location in the University area is probably the main reason it does a good amount of lunch business.  \n\nI had the Deluxe Sushi Platter and it was filling because the rice balls were HUGE!  The pieces of fish topping them were also large which required quite the mouth calisthenics to maneuver them (especially the more chewy pieces like the octopus).  I say make the pieces smaller so they're easier to eat and add another one to the platter to make up for the lost volume.  The rice was appropriately sticky but flavorless and a the temperature wasn't quite right.  It was just okay, but it'll do when jonesing for raw fish.\n\nThe three star average rating of this place is pretty much spot on.
2 ||| A resident of the Charlotte Metro Area for over 9 years, yet I had never seen the Panthers live until now.  It's definitely a different experience than watching from your couch!  I'd recommend everyone go to a game at least once.  There's a tier of excitement that one cannot experience on TV.  The buzz of the crowd is unyielding.  You get to see all of the action without pesky commercials and you have the backdrop of the city skyline to boot.\n\nThe stadium is pretty much what you'd expect.  Typical food, fanfare, and gear available for purchase.  Get your hotdog, beer, jersey, etc. while in route to the bathroom or back to your seat.  The club level offers a more exclusive lounge area with somewhat shorter concession lines, but don't expect any gourmet pretzels.  Of course the pricing is insane and the selections are limited.  The only Gatorade offered is \"Ice Blue,\" as it most closely resembles the team color.\n\nIf you don't like crowds, brace yourself.  The security checkins are elbow to elbow and are required for entry.  Dump the contents of your pockets and get waved by the magic wand before making your way to your seat(s).  \n\nAnother plus here is the people watching factor.  You're sure to see all types of people at any game.  I'll leave it at that and let you see for yourself.  Prepare to be potentially smacked in the face by someone's swirling fan towel or have your chair kicked numerous times by the bratty 8 year old in the seat behind you.  Don't get me wrong, it's all part of the experience.
0 ||| It's Rubio's. 'Nuff said.
4 ||| We love this Dillard's!  All of the departments that we frequent have awesome personnel that consistently greet us and take good care of us (men's, big and tall. juniors, women's, kids, shoes, housewares, lingerie).  Returns are quite simple as long as you pay attention to timeframes (some clearance items have a 3-day limit).  Throughout the year they have big sales that allow an additional 30-40% off already marked down items.  Can't beat it!
3 ||| I really enjoyed the old pharmacy feel of the place with the decoration.  I just like anything with an old timey theme to it.  If you can avoid the lunch rush do so, it can get kind of crazy at times.  But other than that it's a nice little place.  The chicken salad is great and the selection of ice cream and shakes can provide endless fun.
3 ||| We went there for the room and the food and gambling. The penny slots were 'generous', the food was good, but the beds left something to be desired. I am a bit 'fluffy' and so if that was a stress to the springs... They need to upgrade the mattresses. \n\nConvenient and clean place otherwise. Smelled clean, not smokey, even tho its an older casino.
4 ||| I love Barro's pizza but there are none by my house which is sad.  I was in the area so I stopped in for a pie and decided to try something new.  I ordered the wing pizza which is wing sauce cheese and chicken and it was pretty good.  Barro's always has a great pie and if there was one by my house I would order delivery way too often and probably be 100lbs bigger.
4 ||| Came here looking for meat and nothing but.  Ended leaving with 3 bags of really fresh vegetables, 5- 1 inch thick porterhouse, 2 flank steaks and 3 Delmonico cutes.\n\nTo start off, the vegetables were beautiful and fresh.  I picked up some bell peppers, poblano peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and asparagus.  All thrown into a hobo pack which turned out to be one of my top 10.\n\nThe meat was the star.  They had a decent selection.  Its not nearly as diverse as Pino's in NYC.  I wanted to get a solid necktie but they were out of skirt.  This is my one main point of contention with this place.  Its Friday afternoon, have the #1 griller available.  To compensate I took home the flank.  Good, but no skirt.  I went with the porterhouse too as its a crowd pleaser without breaking the bank.  The steaks were thick, juicy and perfect for the bbq.  \n\nMcGinnis Sisters did have a fine looking poultry and fish section, along with pork and lamb, but I was dead set on the beef.  Good job, McGinnis.
4 ||| Daisy and Debbie have been cutting my children's hair for the past two years. The service has always been excellent and the staff very friendly.
4 ||| Love this place...cool vibe, fresh breads, and unique options. So good.
0 ||| I have been going here for years, and sadly in the last couple of years the customer service has gone down hill tremendously.\n\nI love the Dental assistants- best cleaning I have ever gotten.  But that does not make up for the horrible front desk help, or the lack of care I got when they totally botched my root canal. It took 3 days of work on my one tooth, and at 5pm on the final day ( as I was leaving town for 2 weeks the next day) the dentists realized that both of them where in way over their heads and wanted to send me home with a half done root canal.  Not cool!!   When I called back with issues I was having- I was told I would have to wait from a Thurs to Tues to see the dentist that screwed it all up.  \n\nWe have since moved to a different dentist- and have had a horrible time trying to get records from this dentist.  \n\nI would think twice!!
1 ||| Any other casino but gosh dang it!  I hate that \"jackpot hand pay\" in slot machine is $200 and up. It takes them long time to come pay \"jackpot\" $200 and they always give me seven $20 and two $10s wait around for $5-$10 tip for slowly bringing \"jackpot\" $200. Lol \n\nHonestly what casino makes 200$ jackpot ? And expect any tip for it? Most people lose $200 in 10 min on slots. \n\nI wish other casino was closer to me at least their \"jackpot handpay\" is the standard above 1200  just feel like they r finding way to rip even more money off.... No one want to tip on 200$ when it takes $300 to get it . Make it more convenient and people will happily tip more I'm sure .   Some of the slot people are sooo rude too.   People are losing tons of money daily so it's very bad to be rude ....  \n\nOther than that table games are fine, slot selections are okay, regular staff is okay, it's normal casino.  Please fix the hand pay system.
4 ||| Piper's is really a one-of-a-kind pub in the heart of South Side. It's the only place that you'll find open at 7 AM on a Saturday for the earliest soccer games. It's the confluence of family-friendly atmosphere, young professional hangout, punk attitude, and rowdy soccer fandom.\n\nDon't be fooled by the pub's unassuming looks. The food at Piper's is tops in the South Side...and I'm not just talking bar food. From Sunday brunches to Tuesday night vegan specials, Piper's takes all of it's food seriously, and you taste the quality.\n\nFor my money, this is where you'll find the best fish and chips in Pittsburgh. Some of my Irish friends would argue this with me, but I'm sticking to it. It's a great place for hearty meals like Guinness stew and Shepherd's Pie, but you'll also find filling and delicious items of slightly \"lighter\" fare. The hot pepper smoked turkey sandwich, housemade black bean burger, and the sweet potato po' boy are all some of my favorites, but nothing tops the brunch for me.\n\nStop in on Saturday or Sunday for an Irish boxty, and you'll be set for the day. If you haven't experienced a boxty, seriously give it a shot. Saturdays, they have special boxty and you'll often see Monday lunch specials using boxty, like a pulled pork boxty. Brilliant stuff. Sunday brunch also offers some excellent french toast.\n\nFrom typical bar food, to sandwiches and burgers, to full-on entr\u00e9es, Piper's does a solid job.\n\nAs for the beer, Piper's takes pride in picking out excellent choices of craft brews, supporting some of the more local breweries. Their selection of cask and draft beers are something worth paying attention to, as they don't last long. You also will be hard-pressed to find a better pint of Guinness in the area.\n\nIn the end, Piper's is a great, low-key place to catch your favorite soccer games (if you're a fan), get a great, reasonably-priced meal, and enjoy some quality beer. The scotch selection is serious, but as someone who's not into scotch, I'll leave that to the more knowledgeable. See you there!
4 ||| Love love love this place!! Everything in this store is awesome. They have everything from books to candles to crystals to jewelry. If they don't have what your looking for, they will be more than happy to find it for you and order it! The staff is amazing, I love them. They are so helpful!
3 ||| I was pretty excited about this place, since I saw it mentioned multiple times in the \"best breakfast in Vegas\" thread. I figured if it was referenced more than once this place must be the real deal!\n\nI was pretty unimpressed. My girlfriend and I usually have breakfast once a weekend, and we have been rotating around new places every week, and so far I think Babystacks was our favorite place.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my girlfriend got the white chocolate chip pancakes here and they were GREAT! I really liked those. However, I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was pretty... Meh. The country potatoes were alright, not great. The burrito itself had ok flavor, but being that it was pretty big and literally coated it sauce, I had to eat it with fork and knife. I was just really not psyched about it. I wish I had ordered something else. \n\nOne of the off putting things for me was the menu. As another review mentioned, he thought Cheesecake Factory was bad, but wow this place has too big of a menu. I hate when restaurants throw every possible option in the world at you. It makes it very difficult to make decisions, it puts more stress on the kitchen, and instead of deciding between a handful of great options like Babystacks, I was choosing between Mexican style breakfast or not haha it was overwhelming. I prefer a restaurant to put out what it does best. Keeps it simple, keeps the food good. \n\nThe prices also were good but not great. If it was cheaper I would have been less upset with my meal. My girlfriends pancake special though was a good deal, 7.99 for pancakes and sausage and eggs. Wish I had done that! \n\nOverall just not very impressed. Maybe will be back, but only if I get tired of other places.
3 ||| Think old style diner, and you get this place.  The atmosphere and decor is kitschy, funky, and interesting, and the food is generally tasty, but in an old style way.  For example, if you order a shake, you get milk and ice cream that isn't all that thoroughly mixed, just like you used to make at home.  It was awesome and nostalgic.  Ultimately, it is as serviceable as any Denny's substitute with better prices and some really outstanding service.  The other reviews on that score surprised me, but we were there later at night, so maybe during the day the staff gets overwhelmed.  All I can say is that the guy who waited on us (whose name I can't remember, but he was a young bald guy) was an outstanding example of customer service.  I wish I could clone him and put him in every restaurant in America.  Go here.  It's not haute cuisine, but you'll enjoy yourself.
0 ||| Rachel Ray says if you see a restaurant with a line, it's a good sign the food is good. Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting; I gave my name (table for 1) and was told maybe 3 minutes. A couple of other people came in behind me and were added to the list. As I looked around between the row of tables on the right side of the restaurant, the main dining section, and the area on the left there were 8 empty tables I could see, plus half of the bar was empty. So what's with the wait? My 3 minutes turned into closer to 10. \n\nThe hostess sat me at a table and said the server would be right with me.  A few minutes later and he wasn't there yet, so she came back and took my drink order. She returned (still no server) and she asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the soup and she had to check (which is fine since she isn't a server and doesn't need to know what the soup of the day is currently). I ordered the soup and a salad - which normally would be the $6.99 lunch special, but only until 3pm. Finally the server showed up with the soup and he said he thought the salad was almost finished. It's a salad - the smallest one of the menu and shouldn't take that long. The soup and salad are also on the 13 minute lunch menu so it should be quick. He returned one other time with a refill on the drink\n\nI finished the soup and salad, yet the server was not around. The empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly 10 minutes. He when he came back I asked for the check and it was another wait. All in all it was an hour dining experience for a cup of soup and a small salad. As I left, the lobby was full with people waiting for a table - but once again there were several open tables. \n\nIt wasn't that busy, especially for a Saturday night, yet the lobby was full when there were plenty of seats available and the server was very slow.  The one redeeming factor was that it wasn't karaoke night. That usually is a horrible experience.
0 ||| Called for an arrangement for pickup, told the person who took my order that I would be able to pick the arrangement up at 5:30pm.  She asked if I could get there any earlier, I said I would try my best, but I work until 5pm, so maybe not.  She said ok.  \n\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I'd be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \n\nArrangement was just OK.  I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted.  \n\nEven though the location is convenient, I will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time.
0 ||| The staff here is very rude and uncaring. Tried to get  info on the phone and Donna wasted a lot of my time on hold or sending me to voicemail. Eventually she got very snappy and said if I didn't want to wait I should spend a small fortune going to the ER. When I finally got to my appointment the girl at reception wouldn't even bother to greet me but continued her conversation with coworkers. The first thing she said to me was a terse request for my co-payment. The doctors are fine but every time I go for an appointment I have waited an hour to two hours past the appointment time with no explanation or apology. These are just the latest examples of what happens every time for the last two years. I've had it and will now be looking for another medical group.
1 ||| Grease, grease, and more grease. \n\nI come here a lot because it's a 2 minute drive from my work. I always order the same thing, carne asada or lengua tacos, carne asada fries or nachos. Either or.\n\nI never, ever order over the phone. There's always a language barrier and they don't seem to get my order right.\n\nOther than, food comes out quick.
1 ||| Coffee is ok. The sandwich is mediocre like you can make it at home for $7? I don't think so. I expected more. Their employees don't have uniforms but they are way too sloppy eve looks dirty. On a tank top all sloppy it doesn't look professional. I know it's a coffee shop but it says a lot. I like how they have the different coffee beans decor on the wall. That's pretty cool. Prolly won't come back
4 ||| Walked in at 3:30PM on Friday to see if they could fix a failed network component external power supply that appeared to have bad capacitors.\n\nAfter the gentleman at the ERC front desk popped the cover open and looked at what they were dealing with I was quoted a reasonable price for them to try to fix it and asked if I wanted to leave it with them or wait. I decided to wait.\n\nERC fixed the power supply by replacing capacitors and had me back out the door in about 25 minutes on a Friday. I was able to get back to my office in time to install the repaired power supply on the network device without any interruption to the start of my weekend.\n\nI will definitely be giving ERC my business for these types of repairs in the future. If they can fix it it's cheaper, faster and easier than used/refurb parts from eBay or unknown internet vendors and hoping the item is as described.
0 ||| Fail burger,  13 $ for a burger fries and coke?, a 15 min wait only to find out they gave my order a way . a half hearted apology from the frycook who is either high or drunk. The manager and staff seem like they rather be somewhere else
0 ||| I have had good service and good food from this location.  last evening the service was so so and then there was a HAIR in the cheese which wasn't found until it was baked.  Called them and the \"manager\" Gustavo comment was, \"it must be the girl who works here because all the rest of us are guys and have short hair\"  He had no solution for the problem.  I asked for an Owner contact and he gives me the number for a Scott 480-510-6920.  A call to his number goes to voicemail and no return call.  This is very poor customer service....
3 ||| I was turned on to Macado's by the one in my college town, and that one (Boone, NC) is better than this one.  I think this location (Concord Mills) may be bigger, but the service is not better.  I seem to have service issues (slow!) nearly every time I come here but the food is good, so...  It's a good place to stop for a meal before seeing a movie.  If you're trying to make a specific movie time, though, don't stop in here expecting a quick in-and-out.
0 ||| It takes management several weeks to a month to finish or begin repair requests. When it does finally get done, it's sub-par. Children are very noisy and are allowed to go unattended. I don't know about the rest of the apartment complex but my neighbors are very rude and noisy. Several complaints have done no good. By account in any GOOD complex they would have been evicted a long time ago. It appears after only a few months of living here, that anyone can get away with anything here.\n\nPeople leave garbage around the complex, and the laundry room is terrible. Crummy washers and dryers, and they expect people to pay $1 each. Plus there are only 3 for the whole complex so sometimes you cannot get any laundry done. Walls are very thin. I know when living in apartments you are going to get some noise but this is ridiculous! Rent is high for these outdated (asbestos popcorn ceiling), old apartments. Which would explain the need for constant repairs. Bathroom is very tiny, allowing for very little movement. I don't know if they are trying to save money, but they are going about it the wrong way by cutting off the lights way too early so the complex is pitch black in the morning when I go to work. Arms outstretched is how big it is.\n\nRecently since I don't live here anymore, my brother and sister moved in and some pedophile tried to lure my sister back to his apartment! After calling the police it turns out he is related to the owners or some type of garbage like that.  We had extensive flood damage that destroyed thousands of dollars in furniture due to the upstairs neighbor having a washer when it is forbidden. Numerous times this happened where the water would come flooding down from the light alcove in the kitchen. Finally there was one huge flood where we had to move out for a couple of weeks until everything could dry and things could get put back into place and they FINALLY evicted the man after dealing with his crap for over a year. \n\nThe sauna does not work and the parking is extremely tiny with one one way in and out. Sometimes people will park in your space! The few things I liked were they were gay friendly apartments, behind Di Vito's restaurant, across the street from 7-Eleven and down the street from Savers. There is access to the Arcadia area but do yourself a favor and go a little bit further to rent, these apartments are a dump.
4 ||| The salsa...can I ever say enough good things about the salsa?  I could eat it with a spoon but instead I much on their thin, crispy chips that compliment the salsa perfectly.  \n\nTheir sangria is delicious and my hubby and I split a carafe every time we go there.  My only complaint is that you can't get the happy hour price if you are eating at the restaurant - which is just 5 feet away.\n\nWe love their enchiladas and there is a fish dish (whose name escapes me right now) that is amazing.\n\nService is always friendly and excellent.  By far, one of our favorite restaurants!
0 ||| I'm pissed. After not eating all day and coming from Drai's day club, the only thing on our minds all day was a nice warm bowl of pho. They wouldn't let us dine in because we weren't fully dressed. Not only that, they were so rude in the manner they were speaking to us. I'm extremely disappointed because I've heard nothing but good reviews about this place from my friends. There are plenty of pho restaurants in the area. I will not be returning.
4 ||| This is one of the cleaner and newer feeling Waffle Houses... other than it being really cold in there most of the time... I like it, girl doesn't :)\n\nFood is always good, ladies are always very nice. Typical waffle house... I have no issues here and have visited this location many many times and will continue to return.\n\noh and 24/7... hellz ya!
3 ||| Very simple, rustic fun. Everything was really clean and well kept. The tub was a little bit on the lukewarm side given the recent overnight low temps (but you can't change science). It's a little close to the highway, but you get over it and give into the experience. We brought drinks and a low volume boom box which was totally fine. The staff was very nice and welcoming. I'm excited to return for a camping trip.
0 ||| So, my wife received a $50 gift card for Olive Garden from her work for christmas. We decided to finally use it. We never really go here, we feel there are plenty of other better options. The breadsticks were not good. I remembered liking them in the past but they just tasted bad. I had the chicken parm and same thing. Just not good. My wife had a pasta dish and was not thrilled either. We both ate maybe half our plate. The check came out to like $28. We decided to leave our waitress a $22 tip, not because the service was great because it wasn't, but because we plan to NEVER return there. Too many other places to go that are good!
4 ||| Stopped by for breakfast with my Son before we went to work at Three Square Food Bank, which is around the corner.  We enjoyed a Big Cheeseburger and a Sausage Biscuit Sandwich.\n\nThe service was fast and accurate.  The food was delicious and fresh.\n\nWill I return?  When we work at Three Square, I'm sure we will.
0 ||| Yelpers, you let me down...\n\nI have been searching for good chinese, saw these reviews and decided to check it out. My girlfriend and I were literally the only people in the restaurant at 6pm on a week day. Not a single person came or left the 30 minutes we were there. \n\nI ordered a spicy chicken dish, asked no soy to be on it. Waitress confirmed, \"no soy, only spicy sauce\" and it was brought out at a spicy level of 0. Sigh. Half the reason I wanted asian food was for the spice. But I tried to eat it anyway.\n\nHowever the chicken was like gum. I literally chewed my first piece for about 2 minutes... I wanted to spit it out. Not to mention there were only about 7 pieces of chicken on the entire plate. I took about 5 bites and decided I was done. Ended up driving through taco bell on the way home, very irritated. \n\nAlso, they decided not to turn on the heat when it's about 30 degrees outside. It was barely warmer inside than out, and all the staff were wearing thick jackets. Just, what?... cmon. \n\nAbsolutely will not be back.
0 ||| They suck!! First of all not even 24 hours after I got acrylics one broke, then they painted on the french white tips which is fine, however they did such a poor job. When I came back to ask for a refund they were very rude about it and refused to help. I have gotten my nails done almost for a year and I have never seen such a poor job. DO NOT GO HERE.
4 ||| For my money this is the best place in Madison to get a gyro.  The place is a little shady and hasn't been updated since it was built, but you'll get a lot of good food for not a lot of cash and you will get it with a smile and that makes all the difference.  The gyros are essentially the same as Parthenon and, for that matter, 99% of all gyro places.  I go with the gyro dinner, however, which is double the meat and is absolutely glorious in all of its artery clogging goodness.  I've never tried any of their other items, but they have your usual deep fried fare if you are so inclined.  Also, the owner always seems to be there and in a friendly mood as opposed to the dour S.O.B.s downtown.
4 ||| My experience with Zimbrick Honda in general can be described as patient and thorough customer service, organized, and trustworthy. Bonus points to their Grand Canyon Service Center for being on my way to the mall, and next door to my at-the-moment Pho place in Madison. \n\nIn their waiting room there's free coffee, tea, water, diet soda, and in addition to cookies they often have other snacky options like granola bars, and I've seen goldfish crackers once. I like that I can make an appointment online at whatever hour I like and don't have to remember to call someone during business hours. It's the little things. \n\nMy favorite part is the waiting room, catered to the busy student or professional -  there are several partial cubicles and a free wifi area for people who want to work while they wait.
1 ||| The food was ok, not the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Service was ok, they were making fun of my wife because she was white.  Overall disappointed.
0 ||| Shittest place ever. When i walked into this bar, no one is answering me. They just let me stand over there and make me feel like stupid. Also the bar is quite small and smoky. Didnt like the experience at all.
1 ||| Best sushi I've eaten, bar none. A little pricey, and service was a tad slow, but the food made up for it.
4 ||| I'm not a golfer but I can fully appreciate a pretty, well run golf course and Cedarwood is just that. \n\nThe greens are nicely kept, the staff is very helpful and all the carts were in working order. In terms of the difficulty of the course, most of the folks I spoke to while assisting with a nonprofit golf tourney mentioned that Cedarwood is a great, mid-level course for all players. The club house is spacious and open and the food is pretty tasty. All factors are definitely important to take into consideration when planning a charity golf event! \n\nIf I were to golf, Cedarwood seems like a solid place to check out!
0 ||| I enrolled my son at this place to socialize and learn. However, I am disappointed with this school. In this review, I will share some incidents and facts\n\nIncidents:\n1. On 04/07/2014, at almost 3:30 PM, I went to pick up my three years old son. When I entered the classroom, I found Ms Sandy and Ms Blanca (teachers of the 2-3 years old class), both in the classroom with 1 student eating her snack. The rest of the class was playing in the playground alone and unsupervised. While asking Ms Sandy how my son's day was, I suddenly saw him running to me and crying from pain. His face was covered with dirt and his left eye was injured with some blood on his eyelid. I asked him to explain what happened. He took my hand and walked me to the playground where he showed me a small blue chair. His friends told me that he turned the chair over and he hurt his left outer eye lid and bumped his head. His left outer eye lid with scrap, he had a scratched bridge on his nose. Then I looked at Ms Blanca and I told her: \"can you explain what just happened?\". She said: \"I was cleaning, but the kids told me that my son turned the chair over and jumped through it\". When did the kids tell her if she was cleaning the classroom when I entered the class? That means that my son was injured and neglected without any care. They did not even feel sorry about that and they let me question all that without even thinking to clean his eye and face! his eye was injured and his face was full of dirt which might infect his injured eye! Blanca added that all kids do that and my son imitates them. I said: \"you should not let them do that in the first place. This is very dangerous\". That is not acceptable to leave 25 kids playing unsupervised. This is putting 25 kids in danger. She replied that I was speaking with Sandy and that is why nobody was supervising the kids!that is absurd and ridiculous! because when I entered both of them were in the classroom and the kids were outside. Sandy should send Blanca for a minute or 2 to supervise the kids while she was in classroom for their safety. Later, Ms Sandy cleaned my son's face and gave him an icepack after I confronted them. They lack complete children emergency process.(http://hsapps.azdhs.gov/ls/sod/Facility.aspx?FacId=CDC3824)\n\nBad Leadership: Stephanie, director, defended the teachers not to ruin the school's reputation! When my husband called to inform her about this incident and to express our anger, she did not handle the situation well. She was like \"What do you want?\"  \nThe owner of the place did not even call us to see what happened, to apologize or to sympathize  with us.\n\n2. Last month, I found two girls from the 4-5 years old class bathing my son with dirt. His hair, eyes and cloths were covered with dirt but he did not know that they were bullying him. Ms Blanca and the teacher of the 4-5 years class were supervising but they did not stop the girls from doing that. I confronted Ms Blanca and she said she was sorry and that will never happen again. \n\n3. One time I went and saw him wearing pullup without pants on and he was playing in the playground. They did not even think to  call me to ask me to bring more cloths.\n\n4. TV is tuned on everyday. Why is that? Are they short of academic activities?\n\n5. One day I went at 10:00 AM to see how my son was doing because he was newly enrolled, I was surprised to see the teacher of the 4-5 years old yelling at the students of the 2-3 years old because there was water on the floor!this teacher did not expect to see me in the classroom at that time.\n\n6. Another time I found my son digging a hole with his friend while putting his entire head in the dirt. His eyes were also covered with sand along with his nose and cheeks. When I asked Sandy and Blanca, they laughed!and they said that my son and his friend are trying to escape!how funny!?\n\n7. On March 24, 2014, I picked my son from school and I asked him how was his day and whether anyone hit him. He said that Ms Sandy did. So I asked some parents to collect information about this incident from their little ones. But all of them said that this incident did not happen. I also called Blanca who said that the only incident that she witnessed was hearing Sandy YELLING at my son because she thought that he was kicking the toy oven while trying to take a nap but then she figured out that it was not my son who was doing that.. The following day, I went to the school and asked Ms sandy what happened in front of the director. She said that she made him sit on his bottom but did not hit him. I believed her because I know how she treats her students. \n\n8. He was getting sick every week. \n\n9. Only 1 common bathroom with only two toilet tanks for both 3-4 and 4-5 classrooms\n10. When he was first enrolled, I was told that he will learn some new Spanish words. He actually did not learn any single Spanish word
2 ||| The wash was good but service moved way too slowly (I waited an hour for my car)
4 ||| I have been a customer at this music store not only for gear since I started playing drums, but also for 5 years of drum lessons. They have great staff who are all very knowledgeable about the gear they sell and I have yet to find better prices in any other music store. They treat customers like friends but they don't try to \"sell\" you things the way the big corporate stores do. If you need any kind of music gear, but it at N' Stuff Music.
4 ||| Great little farm store! I shop here often for my flock of chickens(also purchased here) living in my backyard. I bought 12 and only lost 1 when she was still very small. They carry organic feed, which can be hard to find. Love it! Place is kept clean and organized. You get in, order/pick-up what you need and get out. Most of the staff seems to be knowledgeable and friendly. Always willing to help you load the BIG stuff. They recently had a Spring open house type event just before Easter. It was great! The kids had fun and it wasn't crazy busy.
2 ||| Pretty good barbecue. Dark,1950's, Bonanza interior. Friendly servers. Expensive.
2 ||| Nice waitresses. Fun place for old people,  food isn't special.
4 ||| I stayed here during the past spring training season, and this is a great bargain for the price.  The resort is a dot away from Phoenix but it seems like you're in a country of your own!  By luck, the butte is surrounded by a freeway and Anaheim Angels stadium facility that barricades itself from the surrounding neighborhoods.  And so, it almost gives off an \"island feel\" to the resort.\n\nIt's a Marriot Tier 5 (i think) but could be bumped up, I think.
2 ||| I was looking for a middle eastern eatery so I found the other reviews to be helpful, & tried the place out. Yes, the owner is friendly, and the food was good, but here's what they didn't tell me... \n\nThis place isn't really a restaurant, its more like a fast food joint with tables. Sorry, I'm an adult- I don't do Styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. For dinner, we were the only people in the place. Wifey had a chicken plate, and I had 3 side dishes, all good, with diet Pepsi. Bill came to THIRTY-FRICKIN'-DOLLARS!!!!!!!!@#$%%#$@!&*^!!! For that kind of dough, I would have much preferred to go somewhere else.I'm not a cheap bastard, but I do expect to get what I pay for, like ceramic plates and metal silverware. I am still in search of a decent middle eastern RESTAURANT!
3 ||| Is this a fancy pants hotel with Aveda bath goods in the john?  No.  Do people who stay in those kinds of hotels usually call the restroom \"the john?\"  Probably not.  Well, I do.  \n\nThe boyfriend and I took a little jaunt to Madison, and we are not exactly high rollers.  We're more like the penny slots... anyway....\n\nThe Best Western got the job done with an adequate room, no scary stains, and friendly staff.  There was no free continental breakfast, but I apparently can't have it all.  \n\nThe winners at this place?  Pool and hot tub, and a generous AAA discount.
2 ||| I was not impressed.  We were here with a group of friends and the staff didn't seem to care if they waited on us or not.  When our server did come around, he was friendly and seemed to enjoy what he was doing, but honestly, I've had better service at other places
4 ||| I never thought that I could care so much about a tiny little dog! After finding our little Italian greyhound with the dreaded broken leg, we raced her to our regular trusted, veterinarian that we had been frequenting for years. It was near closing hours and they  splinted her, gave her some pain medication and informed us that they could do nothing else for her. They told us that they could not operate on her, nor could they manage her pain overnight. I put in a desperate call to Italian Greyhound Rescue and they reminded me that Alta Vista (right in my neighborhood) had extended hours. \n\nI was so concerned about getting her the best care. The front desk team and owner of the clinic greeted us and put us at ease right away. The vet technicians were very gentle and compassionate to her. We knew that they truly felt for how serious the situation was. I was a very complicated break and she would need a very good orthopedic surgeon. The doctor that read the X-rays to us explained everything in great detail. They helped us decide on the best options to keep her comfortable and calm overnight until we could find a surgeon. They even allowed my husband to go home and get her bed and blanket so she could feel less afraid. \n\nBecause she only weighs 6 pounds, we had some concerns over how much and what type of pain relief she would receive and again all of our concerns were addressed with lots of details to keep us informed. They even gave us a number to call into overnight to check on her well being.\n\nIn the morning when we went  to pick her up, she was alert and pain free. The team at Alta Vista kept the port for her IV in her other leg and even sent her pain management drip bag with her so that they would not have to poke her again at the surgeons office and we would not have to pay for another bag. \n\nIn a hectic and emotionally draining situation, the team at Alta Vista was a comforting, caring resource. We feel we got the best veterinary care in our Phoenix neighborhood at a very fair price for our treasured pet. Thank you so much guys!
4 ||| I have to say despite what you may hear about AAMCO Transmissions as a chain company this place is the exception to all that. Do an online search of AAMCO and you will be horrified how many people complain about their bad experiences. However, this place seems to be family operated by great people who actually care about the work they do. My Ford Explorer started having transmission problems so I did a quick search on yelp and found this gem. I was wary of taking my car here since I heard so many bad things about this company, but after reading so many great reviews of this particular store I was enticed! The staff are super friendly and were quick to answer all my questions. The turn around time took about a day to get it fixed and when I came to pick it up everything worked perfectly. They asked me to check in with them about a week to see if everything was working fine which it was. They also offer warranty for their work. Great shop and excellent service. 5 stars!!!!
3 ||| I ended up here because I thought my 10 year old brother would like it. Turns it these little cars are just as fun as I remember them as a kid! I didn't get a chance to drive the big cars (16 and older) but I was there to hang with my brother and we bought the hour pass; times a wasting.\n\nanyways, you have a multitude of options. We ended up paying the 20$ for the hour drive all you can. I can see this is a good deal if it's not real busy. Basically you can ride as much as you want and not wait in lines. You can also buy tickets for individual rides. The carnival rides were  a little weak for my tastes, but I had fun on them with the 10 year old.\n\nI recommend getting there early during the summer as things heat up real quick. Overall the place isn't going to win any awards for awesomeness, but it's a fun place to take a kid so be one yourself and rev that engine!
0 ||| WHAT A SCAM!!!\nSaw the weekly albertso s ad that listed \"rib roast\"4.97 lb.\nBut when i went there i was suprised to find that you have to buy 20 LBS TO GET THAT PRICE!\nI was not alone there were other shoppers demanding to see the manager.\nI WILL NEVER SHOP ALBERTSONS AGAIN!
3 ||| I got here 1 minute after 3:00pm -- 1 minute -- and she told me that they don't serve lunch anymore.  So I threatened to leave, thinking full well she would ask me to stay and say \"Okay, I'll let it slide this time...\" but she didn't.  Halfway to my car I realized I was hungry, so I returned and asked if I could look at the menu anyway.\n\nDammit.\n\nI got the small portion of orange chicken which ended up being about the same price anyway.  Despite the initial annoyance, I found it very tasty and scrumptious (did I just use the word scrumptious?), so I'm bumping my review up to a 4.  Just make sure to get there PLENTY OF TIME before lunch ends at 3.  Jeez.
4 ||| We are so happy with GVAH!! We just moved here and we're nervous finding a good place to bring our pups. They did by disappoint!! So friendly and the prices cannot be beat!!
3 ||| A very interesting boutique hotel. I've seen pictures on Hotels tonight and was very intrigued by them and wanted to go by and visit the hotel lobby on my next Vegas visit. Was not intending to stay there, but stayed 1 night because of the good deal on Hotels tonight. Did not know anything about the after-hours club, or the noise level. If I did I would have not chosen to stay here, as the music was overwhelming coming up thru the floors of the 4 story hotel.\nUpon check in the valet asked if we stayed here before or knew about the hotel. When we said no, he told us about the club going to 8am. Apparently the only nights they do not have the after-hours club is on Monday and Tuesday, so ask for a room that is not over the club. \nWe are not club people, so getting back into the hotel at night was like going thru security at the airport lol, had to speak to 2 different people to get into the lobby to get to the elevator to get to the room. \n\nThe noise level was loud, but it was because the walls were thin and we could hear the dog in the room next door yelp and bark, the traffic outside because of the thin glass window, and the people above us sounded like they were going to come thru the floor into our room when they walked since the squeaking was so bad.\nAlso the hallways are loud since the floor is tiled and not carpeted. Since this hotel is an old Travelodge, so are the rooms and I took that into consideration with the thin walls and floors. Unfortuantly our A/C didn't cool the room even tho is was on the coolest setting at 60 degrees, it only cooled the room down to about 75. \n\nLoved the chic goth style of the hotel, but it's better for more of a drink and not to stay unless maybe you're going to the after-hours party.\nThe check in gentleman was nice and helpful, but I thought the $150 \"deposit\" for 1 night was a little steep.
2 ||| This restaurant would have rated 4 stars but for our Server. I've heard about Church Brew for some time and had not set out to eat here, but the restaurant we originally planned had closed. The setting is very nice. The food we had (pork tacos verdes and pierogie saute) was excellent. Unlike the station next to ours, Anthony did not explain the beer list, despite our question about a sampler offering we'd seen on the way to our table and questions about the beer selection. He did not take time with our questions and was inattentive after someone else delivered our food. He never refilled our drinks or offered refills or dessert. I noticed the table next to ours asked for a dessert menu and he delivered it without comment or highlighting and no order was placed. We are normally generous tippers, but Anthony got the minimum 15%. I write this for the purpose of constructive comment. All of this cost our Server and the restaurant money. The Server next to us, on the other hand (blonde/white-haired female) took time with each of the two tables we watched to go over the menu and specials in great detail and regularly followed up with her patrons for questions or refills, etc. She also brought the dessert menu and highlighted a couple items which resulted in an order. The food was excellent and although some light background music and a tad more light would have been nice, I will return with visitors, but Anthony needs a slight tune-up and he will be rewarded for his efforts.
0 ||| This place is horrible! We ordered an order of fingers and the size was small they looked like they took frozen fingers and then deep fry them.  We also order fries it had no flavor and a calzone. 3 items totaled $27 with a 10 percent coupon what a rip off!!!
4 ||| We love Crackers & Co! So far we haven't had anything we didn't like! California eggs benny is one of our favorites. Next time we are going to try the pork skillet - our waitress said it's one of her favorites. This is getting to be a nice time of year to spend a Sunday morning on the patio....
4 ||| The Carolina's Aviation Museum is located adjacent to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. It is a rather small museum consisting of a variety of Military and Commercial Aircraft's housed in a single hanger. The centerpiece of the Museum is the US Airway Airbus A320 which was force to crash land in the Hudson River after striking a flock of birds which disabled both engines. Everyone on-board US Airways Flight 1549 survived what has been described as \"The Miracle on the Hudson.\"   While at the \"Flight 1549\" display be sure to watch the documentary presentation, which details the events of Flight 1549 from departure, the landing in the Hudson and the rescue. Also on display is a Douglas DC-3 that was flown by Piedmont Airlines and a DC-7, flown by Eastern Airlines.  There are several Military Aircraft's also on Display including a Harrier Jump Jet and an F-14.  The museum has a small gift shop with a number of Flight 1549 related items.  I enjoy my visit to the  museum and would encourage anyone who has a long layover in Charlotte to visit the Carolinas Aviation Museum.
3 ||| Went here last night, cheap drinks, friendly staff.. will return!
4 ||| This is coming from a Hispanic woman very proud of her own home cooking. I make my own tortillas, beans, etc.. Consider the fact that I am a huge fan of my own cooking as you read this review. \n\nNormally, this is a pretty good joint. It's not bad if you're jonesing for a taco or some really good beans (and don't want to make it yourself). It is considerably tastier than any Filiberto's, and more authentic tasting than places like America's Taco shop. \n\nMy faves are the butter-soaked tortillas, bean burritos, and chicken tacos. I keep it simple in simple joints. Today, unfortunately, it wasn't even close to as flavorful as it usually is. It wasn't worth the hour I put in at the gym afterwards. \n\nBut hey! Normally it is worth a stop, especially if one is deprived of Mexican food at home.
4 ||| If you like pizza by the slice you must go to Ian's, whether it's for lunch or after-bar food.  Ian's sets itself apart by being anything but normal.  You will find such pizzas as mac and cheese, Philly cheesesteak, chicken cordon bleu, etc.  Whenever I am back in Madison I stock up on pizza and bring it back to Minneapolis because you simply can't find anything like it anywhere else I have been.  If you're ever passing through the Madison area it is worth the stop.  Check out their website for more information.\nhttp://www.iansdelivery.com/
4 ||| Having recently moved to the neighborhood, I'm on the prowl for a new pizza place. I was looking for one that delivered, but Pullano's is close enough for pick up, and I read good things about it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nI probably should have stuck with pizza. But we were in the mood for a full, homestyle meal. We ordered a veal parmesan, a chicken parmensan, two wedding soups, and a burger for the kid. \n\nThe fact that they had burgers should have been a minor warning sign. The fact that they also have a full Mexican food menu should have been a great big honkin' neon sign.\n\nLike most places in the Valley, Pullano's is tucked in a shabby strip mall. Inside, it's very cheery and friendly. The walls are chocked full of sports memorabilia from the local teams they support, as well as some knickknacks, and TVs airing sports. It's been around a while, and that made it rather comfortable and neighborhoody.\n\nThe staff was all smiles, and after a short wait, had my food ready to go. The price for our meal was around $30. Not bad.\n\nOnce I got it home and unwrapped it, well, yeah. The veal parm was one of those chopped and re-formed patties, dowsed in a bland tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella. The chicken was an actual chicken breast, served in the same way, but had the texture of a dog's chew toy (not that I've actually tried one.)\n\nOn a bright note, the italian wedding soup was really rather good. In fact, we have toyed with the idea of ordering from Pullano's again -- but just soup and garlic bread. Or maybe a pizza.
4 ||| I love Manzella's! My family and I have been coming here for years and usually celebrate my b-day here!  The vibe  inside is very cozy and old school- red pleather booths, wine bottles lining the walls, pictures of Italy, etc.  \n\nI really like how this is a family-run restaurant and they are always there working and attending to customers.  In addition, the prices are very reasonable and the staff is really friendly! 99.99% of the time, I order the cheese manicotti with meat sauce and it's huge- definitely large enough to share!   I usually  take at least 1/2 of it home for later.  The pizza is awesome too!\n\nOverall, this is a great place to take a date or for a family gathering and I love that it's been around for such a long time.  The food and service are great and consistent! :) \n\nPS:  For those cold, snowy nights, they also deliver!
2 ||| It was a brutally hot day up on Mt Washington this past weekend. After going up the incline, we tried walking around a little, but it was just too hot to do anything. This is the first place we found where we could get out of the heat.\n\nAs far as bars go, this place is average at best. We didn't eat - just a few beers and soaking up their AC.\n\nHowever, what a view! They have an outdoor balcony that looks right over the city. Even though the heat was killer, we had to suffer through it a little longer to just sit outside and enjoy the city view.\n\nDefinitely worth a stop just for the view.
3 ||| It's Olive Garden. I love the salad I get it with Italian dressing and ranch on the side and mix it together, then dip my bread sticks in it. I drink the peach iced tea and both moscatos red or white both delish. I do not venture into the new items on the menu other than drinks because I was disappointed twice to many. So I just  get what's on the OG menu. Oh and yes service is great here, even on the east side.
4 ||| One of the better Chinese food restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is pretty authentic, and while they have your standard American Chinese food, they have some genuine-tasting Cantonese dishes too.
4 ||| So I actually tried Burrito Express on a Sat morning with my brother and my daughter, my daughter was buying (she has a job now and can afford to take her mom out haha) and told me I needed to try this place, so we did.\n\nI had a breakfast burrito, it had ham and eggs but also threw in some chorizo into and ask the guy to hit it with some red chile sauce, and don't be shy, while it was cooking and he did! Man that was a kick butt breakfast burrito!! \n\nSo that made me think um wonder how their lunch time burros are. So I went to check them out at lunch time and ordered me a steak and salsa burrito, it had steak, cheese, lettuce, and salsa! I made it combo so it came with beans and rice.\n\nWhile I was paying the guy asked if I wanted hot sauce, and I said yea  both red and green, (sn: their green sacue is really good! Def do try it) and he said one of both, I said more like 2 of both ( really I wanted atleast 3 of both, I like my food packed with heat!) he said can you eat them all.....pls he does not know who he is talking to,,bring on the heat baby! I can handle it!\n\nSo I paid and was getting ready to walk out and go next door to Starbucks and he said do you want your food, I was like wow its ready? He said its not burrito slow, its burrito express, too funny.  I like people with personality!  And guess what!! This place delivers!!! How freakin cool is that!! \n\nI think I have found me a new little joint and ready to try the rest of the menu out!
0 ||| Weirdly there is no yelp for the Verona one. So I am putting it here.  But I wish I had read these. \n\nI didn't realize until I read other reviews that they include a shampoo with your hair cut. My hair cut last about 10 minutes.  I have hair that is the same length, all I wanted was it cut so that I could still put it up to sleep. I specially mentioned this to her twice.  I wish I could include a picture of how short it actually is. Good luck hearing from someone if you want to talk to someone about not liking your cut.  \n\nMy advice pay a few dollars more and find a place that will take responsibility when they screw up.
2 ||| Big selection of toys for kids. Place was kinda run down, looked like it was built 40 years ago. Lots of people. Bought a train set for the Xmas tree, didn't work so returned it no problem. Bought a diffrent one that works sometimes, there is a note on the control that tells you when it doesn't work to stick a screwdriver in it like so... Why would anyone sell/make that? Quality of toys is low. Price is decent.
0 ||| I was surprisingly disappointed last night as my husband and I ate at The Keg for our 36th wedding anniversary.  We have eaten at The Keg before and loved it, which is why we chose to return.  We were seated at a  wonderful corner table with round seating just for the two of us.  The waitress and all other staff were efficient, courteous and friendly, yet professional.  Our issue was with the food, and specifically with our entrees.  First off, The Keg had a weird menu that night, and I think it's temporary, where the only choices were crab and steak.  I chose the Dungeness Crab ($31) and my husband had New York Steak embellished with crab and other seafood ($33).  My crab was a lot of work to crack open and all, which for some reason I just didn't remember I'd be doing that when I ordered it.  So I was up to the task, but the crab meat inside was just very mediocre and a bit discolored....measly, not plump and luscious.  The garlic potatoes accompanying my crab were dry, and I had to keep taking drinks of water between each bite.   My husband's steak was the worst.  It was tough to chew (even though it was medium rare) and seemed to be fettered with some kind of gristly meshing.  We purchase our beef from a frozen foods delivery truck to eat at home.  Our beef is at least 50 times better than what we ate at The Keg.  The Keg was aware it was our anniversary, as was our waitress, yet nothing special was done as it normally is when we go out to celebrate something special.  Usually restaurants (like Flemings, Va Bene, and Lon's) will bring a special little dessert or chocolates for us to share to commemorate the occasion.  I don't think we'll be returning to The Keg for quite awhile now.  There are so many other wonderful restaurants out there.
0 ||| Never. Again. (at this location)\n\nFriday night was rough.  On the way back from the bar I blew out a tire and changed it on the side of the road at 2 AM.  By the time I got that taken care of and got everyone home it was nearly 3.  I was spent and needed a little sustenance.  Taco Bell is almost closed, so where else to go??  I channeled the old college student within and went to Whataburger.  Whatamistake.\n\nCome to think of it I've had a couple sketchy experiences at this location (i.e., undercooked meat etc), but alcohol and/or exhaustion must have clouded my judgement.  Being the ONLY customer in the drive thru, getting a single burger should not have taken this long.  I would say it may have taken longer since they were adding a slice of cheese they so graciously charged and additional .45 cents for, but wait, they neglected to put it on at all.\n\nAfter taking one bite it all became clear.  It took so long because they must have been shaking a salt shaker above it for at least 5 minutes.  Gross.   \n\nNever. Again.
0 ||| I used to love this place but the quality has gone so downhill over the past few years. They've substituted unique dishes with cheap, low quality ingredients. It seems they stopped caring circa 2007.
4 ||| Great for burgers,  dogs and ice cream.  Reminds of a mom and pop place from my home town that was only open in summer.
4 ||| Coming here is cheap entertainment.  The store is big and stocks tons of foods from all over the world.  They even have some green tea/mango/red bean ice cream.  The back section is mostly frozen fish/animals (various fish, anchovies, snails, whole chickens, octopus, squid, CUTTLEFISH?).  They even have a big pile of Durian, along with several kinds of Durian-flavored wafers with their own typed disclaimer that says something along the lines of, \"Yes, the wafers are supposed to smell like that.\"\n\nI make the trip mostly for the selection of Mexican food and sweets.  They have many kinds of Mexican candy, along with canned goods you can't find in regular grocery stores.  Everything is cheap, cheap, cheap and never expired.\n\nEvery time I've gone the cashiers have been kind, or at least civil.  They get you in and out and on your way quickly.  Seems they have even started taking credit or debit cards now.\n\nGo check it out, buy some foreign candy, and gawk at the durian and cuttlefish.  It's really worth the trip.
4 ||| In the very great and wise words of my father \"Holy Crap That's Good!\". There is no wiser sentence that can describe how amazing this place is! One of my dear friends took me to this place that he knew about. It apparently is the \"IT\" place to go in Vegas. I had my doubts. \nWe drove up to the place and it looked a little dumpy (apparently this is a sign of a great place to eat). There wasn't much on the wall except for a menu with about 30 different subs. I allowed my friend to order for me since it seemed like he knew what the best thing to get was. He ordered a turkey sub on wheat with slaw and extra Russian. \nThe kids behind the counter couldn't have been much older then 17 and reminded me of every single person in my graduating class. Helpful and pleasant enough to not get fired. When they were done making my sandwich I swear it was the biggest \"medium\" sub I had ever seen. \nWhen I took my first bite it was to die for! It was not a sandwich for the dainty. The sandwich got all over the place and was the best sandwich I had ever eaten! I had never eaten a sandwich with Cole slaw on it, but it is something to be tried. \nI declare that everyone needs to eat here!
4 ||| Love this place for produce. Clean and well stocked. Short wait times in line. Probably wouldn't pick up anything else here. But that's OK.
3 ||| Fun to stop by if you are in the area, but I wouldn't recommend coming here if it's a drive for you. We stopped by after spending time in the Lost Dutchman State Park and poked around the stores which are mostly selling the same type of stuff you'd find in Old Town. The old western feel of the town is nice, but it is small so it's not like you feel it for very long. There is a cool store selling horseshoes and wall hangings/sculptures made out of horseshoes and other metal and I found a cactus cookie cutter. We went into their museum ($1 donation each) and though most of it looked like a school project, there was a historic wooden bar that was cool to see. We missed the wild west show but saw the actors getting their drink on at the saloon.
4 ||| This is one of the finest gun ranges/stores I have visited. During the weekend it can be crowded with a lot of people just browsing, but you can still get on the range. Membership helps a lot too. If you are looking to purchase come to SGC during the week and you will get a lot of attention from helpful staff. This store is very competitive when it comes to pricing. Great experience in purchasing and shooting from here.
4 ||| This place is totally aided by having one of the best juke boxes I have ever heard. Not a shitty MP3 player one either. An actual jukebox, where the employees change the CDs! I have listened to friend's bands on this juke box which is kinda fun!\n\nNonetheless, it is a dive. It has all of the dive qualities, drunk regulars, middle aged women who are still hanging in bars and ratty pool tables. The bartenders are pretty cool, the menu is nonfunctional at most times and if someone spills a drink on you, they will usually buy you another or are going to fight you.
3 ||| I drive out here for these reasons:\n\nI like me some fake duck.\nThey have an insane wine list, and a decent beer list.\n\nClosed on Monday, open for lunch and dinner the rest of the week, Shanghai is better-than-average Chinese fare that has a full page of veg-friendly options. It is also very affordable, with mains coming in at about $9-$10 each. Its a smaller menu than I'm used to, and not everything is available (looking to try the \"vegetarian seafood medley\" I was informed it was no longer being served, since no one was ordering it). A surprising number of the appetizers are, however. We went with Lettuce Cups, which was pretty standard, except for the sauce that accompanied it. No plum sauce here, but spicy, watery, sweet-sour hot mustard! Wowza! I was happy.\n\nLike Donna said, they'll do whatever level of hot you want. I ordered my stuff at a 9 (out of 10) and wasn't satisfied. You can ask for whole chili's rather than dried flakes, and that's my plan for the next time I come, 'cos I crave the heat. \n\nI'd have another star to award Shanghai, but I find the lack of veg-friendly soups a little sad, having to pick through their larger-than-what-they-actually-serve menu a bit of a hassle, and the flavors a little far over the \"too sweet\" line.
0 ||| Don't order the  steak fajitas .I've had more meat stuck between my teeth from a Big Mac than that was given to me on my plate !
4 ||| I've been going to Steve's before it was even Steve's (before him and Ned parted ways).\n\nI love this place. Kinda sketchy location but I'm totally ok with that since I swear they haven't raised their prices in 20+ years. My fav sandwich shop in the east valley, even over Ned's (dare I say it). The reason I compare the two is because they are basically one in the same - same menu, same decor, right down to the old arcade games. Where Steve prevails for me is that I like their bread better and I don't have to deal with snotty Mt. View teens working at Ned's. Sometimes there are teens working at Steve's but they are so much more polite than Ned's employees. Usually though, there are the sweetest middle-aged ladies working at Steve's.\n\nThe food is really good. I've pretty much had everything on the menu over the years, but my favorite is still the poor boy on white with everything cold :) In fact, I love the subs here so much I had Steve's cater my kids birthday party last year.\n\nGreat Mesa institution. No frills. Just good sandwiches and friendly service. Good enough for me.
1 ||| A friend steered me here for the horchata, but you know what?  It just wasn't very good.
3 ||| The point of going to Alexanders is to cook your own food. If you just want a steak then go somewhere else. \n\nThat said, the experience that they create at this restaurant is wonderful. Albeit the salad bar is nothing special and the menu is somewhat limited, the atmosphere is lackluster, but if you like grilling in your back yard with the guys then you will love Alexanders. Also, Don't feel too bad about filling up on all of the Texas toast (it is kinda the point...and half the fun!)
3 ||| For my 600th review, it seemed appropriate to write about the place that brought me to the scenic wonderland of the Midwest, The University of Illinois here in delightful Urbana-Champaign.\n\nFor a Southern California pseudo-hipster and person of color raised in Los Angeles and educated in San Diego, the U of I is a bit of a disorienting shock.  It's gigantic, yet full of personality and character.  It's also on some levels every stock stereotype about the 'college experience', from the pretentious architecture (that screams \"we look like an East Coast college!!!  Bricks!!  Yay!!!\") to the terrifying/amazing/astounding/bizarrely huge percentage of students involved in a Greek life that resembles in almost creepy detail the stereotypical movie depictions of said groups, to the absolute obsession Illini sports engenders.\n\nI love a lot of it, with the fantastic resources, first class scholarship and immense potential.  I turned down Stanford and a few other 'name' schools as I was amazed and remain constantly impressed by their history doctoral program, and I'm thankful to be here for the education.  However, the location is a bit remote (although sometimes corn can be charming, I swear!), and there are some considerable issues here at U of I that have to be mentioned.\n\nWhile the U of I is definitely a brilliant academic institution and a great place for meaningful exchanges of ideas, diversity is weak here, and cultural understanding/communication is particularly weak.  The issues surrounding the infamous mascot linger on years after its supposed resolution, and to be a person of color in central Illinois is occasionally a difficult and daunting prospect indeed.  I've been called the 'n' word already, and it's a hard place to process when there are screaming groups of students that have been known to have 'tacos and tequila' parties and still openly ask for the return of a racial caricature as a mascot.  It's daunting, but not insurmountable.\n\nMost of the students I've met here are friendly, engaging, and generally cheerful.  They mean well, although it is *hard* to sometimes deal with racism either explicit or less intentional, honestly, and incidences like this year's vandalism of the Native American art exhibit outside the culture houses are emblematic of that.\n\nThat said, the school's trying.  The people of color are vibrant that are here, there is a good community, and it's growing.  I'm thankful for that.  There's a strong organizing tradition here.  People *care* about things, and it's nice to see.\n\nA year after accepting their decision to come here, I don't regret it one bit, but Illinois is far from perfect or ideal.  It's a fantastic and wonderfully intellectually rigorous place, but it's also a daily challenge, particularly for us people of color who often have to fight to make our own spaces.  But I love it enough here to keep trying, and I certainly won't stop any time soon.\n\nBesides, I've got at least another four years to go 'til I get to be Dr. Teej.
4 ||| Ok, I already made my return. Tried a few more items. The katsu pork is really good. I'm not usually a fan of deep-fried food, but this had a very nice crispiness and the pork still maintained it's moistness. I also tried the saimin. It was just ok. Everything else is fantastic!
0 ||| If another pharmacy was located even twice as far away, I would not hesitate for a second to switch.  They are INSANELY slow and CONSISTENTLY give me the wrong number of pills.  A total of six times now (that we've caught) they dispense fewer pills than what they were supposed to (and I paid for!)  I'd hate to think about how many times I did not catch this practice, as I usually do not count my pills.\n\nSo for the last few months not only do I have a note on my file to \"double count\" my prescriptions, but I ask the person to count them again...to which they usually object and I have to re-explain my pill-shorting experiences...again...and ask them to please count it...again.  Funny the number of times this seems to produce an extra five minute wait...about 50% of the time...while they go fill the bottle with the correct number, I presume.\n\nAnyway...like I said, it is conveniently located and I've never had anything but a great experience outside of the pharmacy...but, wow...if you get pills here, seriously, make sure you count them on the spot.
2 ||| I am not a fan of Kona Grill and it really baffles me as to why this place is always so packed. They do have a lot of items on their menu that sound great but I feel like the quality of the food is very hit or miss. The same with the service from the waitstaff in the dining area. The bartenders can definitely mix up some good cocktails and they have a great patio but the sushi they serve at Happy Hour is awful - not well prepared and tastes like it has been sitting out for a while. \n\nI guess out of the choices available nearby it is not a bad place in comparison. I would definitely rather go here than Cheescake Factory or that new Old Spaghetti Factory (horrible!) but there are a lot better places out there once you escape the confines of the mall.
4 ||| A hidden gem off the Strip.  One of the most fun meals I've had in a long time.  This place is located on the water. Yes, WATER - in Vegas!  Grab a table outside and you're likely to hear live music during dinner (most nights, not sure if all) while gazing out at the water.\n\nWine lover?  That's the next best (best?) part.  The wine shop is adjacent (part of?) the restaurant and you're welcome to stroll the aisles to pick out your bottle at retail prices plus a $10 corking fee. Bonus!\n\nWine AND water.  In Vegas.  To music.\n\nOh, the food? Excellent. We just went with the specials of the night, finishing up with their fantastic bread pudding (which I'm usually not a big fan of). Then again, we were on bottle three by dessert...\n\nMy new favorite Summerlin spot.  Will be back soon to comment more.\n\nUPDATE 9/22: I only return to restaurants if I like them (obviously) but I rarely return to a restaurant two days later unless I absolutely LOVE it. And yes, I went back two days later to try their Sangria Sunday.\n\nSundays bring more live music and Sangria added to the menu. Also added to the menu are 4 tapas (small plate) items that ranged from $7 to $11 each on this visit.\n\nWe sampled 3 of the 4 tapas dishes (some twice) and their outstanding escargot.  Kobe Beef Meatballs in a roasted tomato sauce...mmmmm.  The homemade sausage plate however was the best sausage I've ever had. Yes, great sausage.\n\nThis trip was finished off with the waiter's recommendation of the flourless chocolate cake, which we were going to skip based on the menu description. But don't skip it - fantastic if you like chocolate!\n\nLive music, great drinks, great food, while dining on an outdoor patio set on the water? Yup, I'll be back AGAIN soon.
0 ||| I guess I wasn't drunk enough food was horrible and service was fkn embarrassing it took so long just place the order and of course when we got it it was all wrong !!! Fuck this place
0 ||| This has got to be the worst Walmart in Las Vegas.  It's pure filth:  I went to take a cart from where they're stacked up inside the store, not in the entryway like at other branches.  They weren't exactly stacked up; the store wasn't all that crowded, and there were only a few carts available.  And they sat on a floor so covered in black grime, it looked as if it hadn't been washed since the place opened.  Of course, there were none of those disinfectant wipes availabe to hose down the cart - or me.\n\nI had a list of about six things that I needed, and true to form, they were out of three of them.  These were not exotic items, just stuff like Wite-Out, suntan lotion, but I batted only .500.  And that suntan lotion was their own Equate brand, which had been rated the best in Consumer Reports.  Unbelievable!\n\nI had misgivings about going to this Walmart in the first place;  it's always disgusting,  and I did only because I was going to Ulta on Lake Mead and Rainbow.  I won't make that mistake again.  This branch should be condemned by the Board of Health.
0 ||| Tried to go here twice, both on Friday nights.  They were closed at 9:00 on one Friday night.  The second Friday night, we got there at 6:30 and were told the grill was closed because 'it had to cool down for an hour before they closed.'  So bizarre.\n\nOnce you learn it used to be a carwash, you'll have a hard time imagining it any other way.
0 ||| Omg what a crap hole this place is! The\"showroomm\"is very dark and they have no selection or stock. And rude person at the desk. U know i was just looking for something for the bathroom a four light fixture them place is very drab and dark don't waist your timr home decor id like to know where that is!
2 ||| La d\u00e9coration de ce lieu est unique, vous \u00eates directement transport\u00e9 dans un autre monde en entrant dans cet \u00e9tablissement. Les murs regorgent de stickers et de souvenirs de toute sortes il y a de quoi y passer des heures !! Ce lieu est vraiment unique et vaut le d\u00e9tour ne serait ce que pour \u00e7a.\n\nMais ce n'est pas tout, la nourriture y est aussi tr\u00e8s bonne, leurs angus sont \u00e9norme, d\u00e9licieux, cuit juste comme vous le demandez ! Le service est agr\u00e9ables et les pris sont tout \u00e0 fait abordables, un excellent rapport qualit\u00e9 prix !
1 ||| This resort used to be an apartment complex. The mailboxes are still there, half of them hanging open. There is a hot tub and two pools, usually just one is open. There is always enough parking. No elevators. Jim at the front desk was very nice. He offered for security to take up my bags for me since there were no rooms available on the first floor. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were visiting for a week to check out apartments in the area, so this was good for us. But, if I were to visit here for a vacation, I'd be very let down!\n\nThe room was pretty darn dusty, there was a ring in the toilet bowl, the bed had crumbs under the covers and the bathroom smelled like mold. You have to pay for wifi which I think is absolutely ridiculous this day in age.\n\nI probably wouldn't stay here again. It could have been a lot worse, but it easily could have been much better.
2 ||| My favorite drink on the menu is the vanilla white Russian.  Get it, trust me you won't regret it!  I don't like the graham cracker rim so I request cinnamon sugar instead.\n\nFood leaves much to be desired - could barely find something I wanted.  Ended up with the meatballs which was one entre of 4 small meatballs skewered on a stick and that is it - no side items and no sauce.  Had to ask for a side of sauce to properly enjoy the meatballs.  They were just so tiny though.  Thank god for my white Russian to fill me up the rest of the way.\n\nAlready went back within a week of my first visit to get another one of those white Russians - awesome!!!
1 ||| Okay, It's a Sears.  This location is about as exciting as the rest of Metro Center has become over the years.  Pretty sad, really.  About a small step up from the Desert Sky Mall location, this Sears is where I go to pick up my online purchases so I don't have to pay shipping. \n\n Downside?  Um, I picked up an order today and I received 4 pair of pants WITH NO bag!!!!  Just handed me four pairs of jeans and buh bye.  It's really odd.  You walk in and have to either scan your receipt or slide the credit card through the slider that you placed the order with.  Then it tells you to have a seat and then a person brings your order out.  I'm kinda surprised at that point that your order doesn't just shoot out from a hole in the wall!\n\nThe entire store is like a mausoleum with hardly any employees around.  I like getting my daughter's jeans here but other than that?  What do I like?  Not so much.  I guess it's good for appliances.  Yeah.  appliances.
3 ||| This was a nice place to stay. It's in an area that can be quite noisy sometimes, right near a hospital so you are likely to hear sirens now and then, but not to awful bad. All the rooms here are suites, so it's like a little apartment of your own. You get a kitchen with an almost full size fridge, 2 burner stovetop, microwave, and coffee maker. A little living room area with a couch, chair, and desk. Our room was a king suite, and the bed was very comfy. I liked the bathroom setup, the shower and toilet were in their own little room and the sink was outside, so if I was doing my hair and makeup, my fella could still take his shower and we were not in each others' way. Full closet, ironing board and iron, but one demerit for not having a hair dryer. Free breakfast was pretty darn good,  eggs, waffles, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, bread, bagels, muffins, juice, coffee, and more. Better than most free breakfasts. I will most definitely consider Residence Inns on any future trips if there is one in the area, I was quite comfortable here.
4 ||| They seated us and then forgot us. Coffee was very weak with no flavor. Food was just so so. The one true stand out were the potatoes.  Those were 5 stars. I live in vegas but will never eat here again. Our waitress was awesome. Sadly I don't remember her name. Go down the street to the Egg and I. Much better food for a better price.
4 ||| This place been here for a while and finally stopped to give it a try. Glad we did. The service is good and the food is exceptional.
0 ||| How hard is it to fix a veggie Muffaletta? Obviously its harder than I thought. 2x they messed up my order...not good. Compared to Jason's Deli locations in other states, this one in Henderson just doesn't seem to be up to snuff. With so many other choices of places to eat within a 5 min drive, you can do better by going elsewhere.
2 ||| The ever climbing prices and dissapearing grillied onions have casued me to not visit here as much.\n\nLuckily the light rail constrtion is a thing of the past and one can esialy approce this location.\n\nThe line to order inside can be a bit akward as there is not much room for it.\n\nOn my last trip I went with the grilled veggie burrito as the cheaper bean and cheese burrito now only exists in my memories. It comes with a few chips.\n\nI do enjoy the salsa bar that has sweet and savory salsas cilantro and little peppers.\n\nThe food is decent but for a $7 lunch there are cheaper better Mexican options out there.
0 ||| Wow the owner here is extremely rude and seemed to talk down to me. I stopped by with some items to ask about how selling there works. She  barely acknowledged me after I stood in front of here for a few minutes. Rude rude rude. Never going back
0 ||| Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, \"you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it.\" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food.
0 ||| The service here is terrible.  The place was empty.  We waited for fifteen minutes or more.  I finally asked if we could be seated in one of the many empty tables.  The answer was we do not have enough servers to seat you.  We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.  Maybe they should hire a few more waitresses.  These people did not care one bit if you waited forever.  The worst part was only a very few tables had customers.  This is the only complaint I have ever written.  I will never return to this restaurant!
2 ||| 2.5 stars\n\nGood news for the previous posters - the company that owns this mall is tacking the \"Chris-Town\"  back onto the mall's name.  Not that this will class the place up any, but it'll make things right again.  The name \"Spectrum Mall\" always seemed like they were trying to make it sound futuristic in a '50s kind of way.\n\nI can't say that I've ventured into the mall beyond the Costco in the last few years.  Quite honestly, that Wal-Mart scares me.  It seems seedier than other Wal-Marts, which is saying a lot.   I did enjoy the little store that sold XI clothing though.  It was always good for a disposable trendy outfit, if you could handle the fact that a real-world size small is an XI size large.  \n\nAh, Chris-Town.  Once upon a time you had a Gap and a Dillard's and were the cool place to go.  A shooting or two later and look what you've become.
1 ||| US Air has gone downhill fast over the past few years. I use to be a frequent flyer and had \"status\" with them due to work travel. The past year or so I have not been traveling as much and they act like I was never that frequent customer. To me, that does not deserve my business. I'd rather fly on an airline that appreciates all customers, from first class to the back of the plane, and takes the time to present a clean, modernized travel experience.
3 ||| I'm part of a winery club and they send me wine once a year. They use GSO to ship from California to Nevada overnight. \n\nThe first time the winery sent me wine, GSO was great in response and customer service, both via email and phone. No problems and would have recommended them. \n\nThe second time, which was last month, this is what happened: \n-Knowing the package would be shipped when it was still hot out, I called the winery to ask them to place on hold at the shipping warehouse. \n-They told me GSO would send a confirmation email and I can contact them directly. \n-No confirmation email came from GSO, and a week or so go by and I finally remember to call the winery. \n-The winery gave me the GSO tracking number and from the GSO tracking site, it said GSO tried to deliver twice, but no on was home. I did not receive any notes on my door. \n-I called GSO and asked them to hold it for me so I can pick up. The nice lady on the phone said, certainly, we will call you to let you know. I never received a call. \n-After another week or so, I called and asked if my package was ready for pick up. They said yes, I picked it up. \n\nIf you are receiving packages from GSO, I recommend you follow up with them as it seems they don't have good follow through. \n\nI don't know that I would trust their outbound shipping services if they don't actively try to reach or deliver packages to customers. \n\nIn conclusion, I am still at the mercy of my wine club using this company. Fortunately their warehouse is not far from home and they open until 6:30pm for pick up.
0 ||| Things took a turn for the worse.\n\nThe evolving menu means that even the few veggie options like the mushroom ravioli even have meat broth in the sauce. The couscous that comes with the sole is flavorless compared to the old orso, and the other grilled fish dishes are just small.\n\nI wanted to have a creaser salad with my meal at 6pm  but they were out of salad, and they were not even busy.\n\nNew menus and poor ordering by management mean I wont be back here too soon.
4 ||| I haven't done many reviews on Yelp, but I think my experience with Hansen's is worthy of my time.\n\nWhat I thought was a ignition problem, turned out to be a simple\" dead battery\". They assessed the situation quickly and had my auto back to me in no time.\n\nThe staff was great and kind. I would definitely recommend taking your car to this family shop for your auto needs.
4 ||| This was a sweet little spot for great organic coffee.
4 ||| LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Piper's Pub! This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, and my sister has to go here every time she visits. We love the Shepherd's Pie (I go for the beef version, and she loves the chicken). You can't go wrong with any dish here, though. I've had the English Breakfast (though never actually for breakfast!), the Vindaloo Curry (make mine spicy!), the corned beef, and many other dishes. I've never, ever disliked anything. My husband raves about the Guinness stew and the fish sandwiches. The chicken fingers are even awesome and the best I've ever had! Go here! You won't be disappointed!
4 ||| In the last week I've been here twice, partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\n\nI tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\n\nOur waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.\n\nThe beer was pricy - Tuesday night I had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...
3 ||| Great food and service here but parking is a bit of a pain. Hubby got the chicken fried steak, he said it was quit possibly the best he ever had. I got the chili, it was delicious even though no beans are added. I also got their coleslaw, that was delicious too. It was a bit noisy here not sure if it always is this way but the food was worth it. Our waitress Helen was the bomb! She has it going on, I would highly recommend sitting in her section!!
2 ||| Usually we get our pup shaved but with it being late October, we didn't want her to be cold, they suggested the furminator. NOT effective. Our pup is shedding like a mad man and our money is gonzo. Oh well lesson learned.
2 ||| The WALLS oh the WALLS!  They are toooo THIN! you can hear everything!  BUT the BED oh the BED! I slept sooooo good!
0 ||| Looking to play? Look elsewhere greens are like bubble wrap. I was behind a group of six. They were so slow a group of eight caught us. We trees off at 1:50 and it was too dark to play by the 12th hole. Stay away don't be fooled by the affiliation with Troom golf.
4 ||| I got takeout here today and was not disappointed. The soup of the day was Mushroom Brie Bisque...I mean, how could you go wrong with those ingredients?? It was  everything I hoped for: creamy, savory, luscious, yummy. I wish I'd gotten a bowl instead of a cup. \n\nI also got an order of dolmades. Usually dolmades are cold and often very dense and \"rice-y,\" which can be a turn-off for me. These were warm and almost saucy inside, and served with a warm tangy lemon-cream sauce. Delicious.\n\nAnd there was plenty of warm oiled pita bread, nice and moist to sop the dolmades sauce up.\n\nI'll definitely be back!
0 ||| I gave this office the benefit of the doubt after each visit, only because Dr. LeBlanc was very informative and incredibly helpful. She is no longer there, and good for her~! However, if the doctor had simply been an OK doctor, I would have never step foot in there again. After my first visit 2 years ago, I experience a very condescending staff and unhelpful, rude office manager Linda. Linda chooses to hire people a lot like herself, who are simply unprofessional, unorganized, and miserable with life. I honestly could see them having a hard time getting hired at McDonalds, since McDonalds does have a level of professionalism and standards when servicing customers that the staff in this office would not be able to meet. Linda leads by a miserable, rude standard that only her team follows along. \nThese ladies have given me a difficult time since my first visit and as the girl at the front desk was rude and short. She slapped my insurance card on the counter when giving it to me and was condescending about filling out the paperwork. But I forgiven the situation thinking she was just having a bad day. \nMy following visit 2 years later, the same group of girls still working there to my surprise that they still have a job, had been just as rude and wasting my time. When scheduling the appt over the phone I had let the girl know that I have a new insurance that I have not yet received card in the mail, she told me as long as I had my information that I should OK. \nWhen arriving, I was denied from seeing a doctor since I didn't have my card at hand, but had letters from the insurance company proving that I was insured, along with the copy of the policy information, numbers, etc. I was upset that she was wasting my time and then I was told by the office manager Linda, that the office visit can be paid by a Credit Card and would be refunded the next day once I brought in my physical insurance card, which I did next day. Well that was not the case. They never refunded the Credit Card, although she gave me her word that they would once they saw proof of insurance it would be refunded. So not only did they keep the $150 for the office visit, but they also received the $$$ from the insurance company for my visit that day. \nI was made aware of them keeping the $$$ for the office visit upon my 3rd visit, which I then learned that Dr. LeBlanc is no longer working there. When scheduling my 3rd visit, the lady on the phone mentioned that someone from billing will call me to discuss the refund. I did not receive a call and went to appointment the next day, which was when someone from billing came to speak to me first to discuss I had a balance due?? It simply did not make any sense since they charged the $$$ on my credit card for the office visit, then billed my insurance company for a basic office visit which is fully covered, then asking for more $$$. \nThe reason why they are asking for more $$$ and keeping the $$$ paid cash from the office visit, and attempting to collect from the insurance company, is because they sent my information to my PREVIOUS insurance carrier, and not the latest one. This is an error made of their behalf and they had the audacity to tell me I am wrong and asking for more $$, after I spoke to my current insurance carrier,that the office never notified. \nLinda and the girl at the front desk were being condescending and unprofessional as ever, mentioned that I would need to pay the balance in order to see the doctor, and I honestly felt sick to my stomach after all the back and forth being late to my original appointment over a few $$. I let Linda know that I have had a lot of trouble with this office from day one and at this point I am done with it. Linda responded, \"FINE.\" After living in multiple states, this office is the worst that I have every experienced in my life. This is my first complaint ever written about a business and hopefully the last one I will ever need to write.
1 ||| Why would you put your corporate office on yelp?  This screwed up my morning, was supposed to pick up donuts for the meeting when I pulled up to this location.  Pointless.
2 ||| 2nd stop off the rail pup crawl.. a little walk, nice place for regulars but they did not seem to like having a large excited group there. The server was good, the drinks were good and the price was good. \n\nThe restroom stunk like old piss.
4 ||| Love love love Postinos. It is such a great atmosphere and I'm a huge fan of the rasp chicken salad. \n\nWill be back again and again!
0 ||| 7 months later and my pool is in need of repair. The pump housing has crack from being over tighten as well as the motor not being set level causing lots of vibration. This should have been replaced with the new motor as quoted. You would think for 210.00 dollars in labor they would know how to screw on a motor correctly. NO wonder it only took 25 minutes.\nI wish I had used someone else.
4 ||| I like the kids section.  The white pizza is good.  The wine and beer are super cheap.  \n\nLast time we ate there we saw a huge scorpion hiding on a rolled up rug behind a booth in the kids section.  Freaked me out.  The employee came over to take care of it with a handful of napkins!!
0 ||| Being a business owner myself, I have always lived by the mantra that the customer is always right. This is definitely not the case with this business. I have a video production company and my crew of 2 contractors is working today at the KROC's Boy's and Girls Club literally across the street from this place. I'm currently in New York over the holidays so I'm doing my best to provide them lunch the best I can with the resources available to me. And being that I searched for \"delivery\" on Yelp and this place has a \"yes\" under delivery, I would assume I could get the food delivered. That wasn't the case today. The person that answered the phone said \"No delivery driver today\". Like, what? Is there a schedule for when I can get delivery and when I can't? So, whatever, no problem. I said, that's fine, I'll just order the food and have one of my guys come pick it up real quick. I told him the situation and I asked if I could just pay for the food over the phone since I wasn't in the area and I needed to get these guys lunch. He said \"No, we don't do that.\" Ok, so if someone orders delivery from you guys (on the on days for delivery at that), I'm sure they take the credit card over the phone and get it dropped off no problem, as I'm sure the delivery drivers don't walk around with credit card swipers. Long story short, this guy obviously didn't want my business because he was the most un-accomidating POS as I tried endlessly to find a solution without having these guys come out of their pockets to pay for a meal that me as the business owner should be providing them. It's a shame too because we have a contract for the next year where we'll be filming at that location one weekend a month which could have equaled some good business for these people over the year, but, being less than a smart business man, this person didn't see it that way. It's crazy to me too because our business isn't even a consumer based company and I can sit on my couch at my house and take credit card from my clients over my phone like nothing, and these guys act like it's no big deal to turn away clients. If you need some delivery, don't even bother reaching out to Tam's. If you're local and are going to eat at this shop, do me a favor and slap this guy squarely across the top of his head for me. Happy days!
0 ||| My experiece with them is a so so to below average. Not too long ago, I had purchased a meal deal through drive through one morning. I was told to park in the front and wait for my food, I noticed two customers after me was told to park in the front as well. after 5 minutes of waiting I noticed one of the employees had a meal, she denied it was mine. Patience was not a virtue with me that day. The Second customer after me got his meal. Noticing that I was first and had not yet gotten my food was not right. So I walked in and asked whats goin on with my order, the employee asked for the second time what I had ordered *the order she denied it was my order was really mine*.\n\nI did call the manager that morning and expressed my dismay for a lack of communcation and slow food. He did the right thing and gave me a complementary meal and he had let me know what went wrong that morning (the cook was MIA). when I had showed up at the store, he had personally came from his office and apologized for the mess up.\n\n\n\nI thought all was well until I had ordered my comp meal that the employees may have been messing with me? (its just a theory). Three other customers after me got their meal before I did. So I had walked over to the shift manager and asked if my meal was ready, his stupid ass response was \"I was wondering why that sandwich was sitting there\". I got my food and left.\n\nI would travel a distance in the other direciton to another burger king that has excellent speedy service vs this one.\n\nI'm glad that I dont have stock in this company.\n\nOne star:  For the store Manager (my cost management professor would be proud for his actions, doing everything in his power to make the guest happy; giving me a comp meal).\nTwo Star: free meal
0 ||| I like Black Angus, but this time we had the worst experience. First off, they gave my fiancee a Bud light when he asked for Coors Light on tap. The appetizer ( teriyaki steak lettuce wraps) had a good taste, but the steak was tough. we ordered two steak dinners.The first one, was a New York (it was not a New York and it was tough).The second one was a Teriyaki Top Sirloin (this steak had too much teriyaki-way too strong, I could only eat about four pieces). The green beans were tough and too much pepper WOW. Also,  they were completely out of Prime Rib, which is really why we went to black Angus.
0 ||| Somehow a lot of people kept recommending us this place (might they get paid to do that?). Ordered shrimp fried rice and another one with shrimp and scallops. The first one had miniature, ridiculous looking shrimp (probably imitation ones) while the second one had a few minced scallops and no shrimp at all. We told the waiter who took the dish back to the kitchen only to bring same dish back a minute later. He said that the cooks told him that the shrimp were chopped very little but were there. Of course you could not even smell the shrimp nor see them. Why would they use shrimp in one dish and none in the other is a mystery. all I know is that they will never see us again and we suggest you to do the same. The waiter also said that their food is authentic Cantonese.\nPS: We eat shrimp fried rice at Cantonese places all the time so we know how it supposed to look.
4 ||| Soba is another restaurant in the Big Burrito group's offerings and absolutely another hit. It's located in Shadyside, an area that I rarely venture out to for fear of destroying my car, but I will make the trek for Soba. And Mad Mex.\n\nAs others have noted, the restaurant is very intimate. Compared to Eleven, which is classy and upscale but rather casual (if that makes sense), Soba is definitely date night territory. In fact, my boyfriend took me on our first date to Soba followed by an awesome evening at Cirque de Soleil. What a night it was.\n\nThis restaurant is up to the standards of quality and service that all of Big Burrito's restaurants offer. The food is amazing, the drinks are tasty, and the staff are super friendly. The Asian Plum Sangria and the Bangkok Tea are my favorite drinks there, highly recommend them. The one called Offer You Can't Refuse - be careful. Tasty, but be careful.\n\nAs far as food, excepting one time we've always just ordered a round of different appetizers and spent the night sampling. I've never had anything I didn't like, and I in fact highly recommend the crispy tofu. Yum-my. Even if you think you don't like tofu, you feel so wrong about that stance once you've eaten theirs.\n\nThe only time we ordered entrees was on NYE. We engaged in their pre-fixe menu for the holiday. I can't remember what we had, but I do remember all of it being awesome. It was a really great way to spend NYE, avoiding any type of craziness and filling up on some good food.
2 ||| I rarely drink coffee, usually when I'm making a long distance drive.\n\nBut I've had tea several times at the Smelly Cat. Not bad. Nice too that they gave me more hot water when I was done and I was able to use my tea bag for another cup.\n\nThe dessert was good as well as the sliced sandwich wraps.\n\nThe cons:\n\nI once visited on a day that someone's child was allowed free reign. Like, I saw him playing in the seating area then running behind the counter TOUCHING things, no hand washing apparent. \n\nUm, no.\n\nOn my last visit -- which was my LAST visit -- there was a dog in the shop. Animals are lovely just not in a place where I'm paying to eat.\n\nAs a former pet owner, I know that even when animals are banned from the kitchen, animal FUR can never be banned from anywhere animals are allowed.\n\nThe hair floats on the smallest of breezes and deposits itself where ever it happens to land...
0 ||| Big surprise -- looks like the merger with American will take away most of the benefits US Airways loyalists enjoyed.  Time to bail out and find another airline.  Better check to see how you will lose out!
2 ||| I'd give it 3.5 stars. Good food for cheap, real cheap! Just bring your pepto.\n\nSo we went here 4 days ago just as we arrived in Vegas. \n\nI ordered the 3 tacos plate (comes with rice and beans and a soda for under $5!!). My gf ordered the sopes, and our friend got the taquitos. \nEveryone was pretty satisfied with what they got, the food was super filling. I'd recommend the carne asada tacos over the chicken. \n\nThey also have a good salsa station where you can grab some pickled carrots, jalapenos, radishes, fresh cut lemons, along with 4 different salsas. We also ordered a side of their guacamole, which wasn't anything special, but I'd still order it again. \n\nI have to say though, the reason I'm not giving them 4 stars is that we all felt kinda crappy after eating here, very sluggish. I know it's mexican food, and I know it was probably greaser than you can taste which was probably the culprit, but nonetheless the feeling was mutual between us 3.\n\nI'd still go back!
0 ||| Just came here for a Mother's Day brunch.  We called the day before and made reservations for 11:00 knowing that it was going to busy.  We arrived about 5mins early and were told that the the table was just going to be cleaned up and we would be seated.  We proceeded to wait for half an hour.  We saw people get seated that had just put their names on the list while we waited, and these were parties of the same size as us (7).  Once we were finally seated we all decided to get the buffet which was kind of the special.  Once up at the buffet it got worse.  It seemed like they had been way overwhelmed. There were things on the buffet that were missing  like the prime rib, there was just a pile of the fat scraps and no one there cutting anything.  There were things that were cold and picked over as well.  Also none of the plates or cups matched, which is not really a big deal but just added to the unprofessional appearance.  I used to like going to this place when I lived here and thought it would be a good spot to take my mom.  It turned out horrible and I will never be returning here, nor recommending it to anyone.
4 ||| This place is great!  You definitely feel like you are in an old ranch house when eating at this restaurant.  The food is great, especially the steaks!  They only lightly season the meat, allowing you to enjoy the taste of the steak rather than the taste of spices, like many chain steakhouses.  Also, the price is great when comparing to other Vegas steakhouses... on or off the strip.  \n\nFor a side note, we hosted a work holiday party here for 40 members and they did a wonderful job!  Everything was cooked great, the service was excellent, and several \"first-timers\" promised to go back!
0 ||| Attended a private wedding reception on Saturday afternoon/evening.  BAD EXPERIENCE!! (with the alcohol part)  I don't know what was charged to the wedding couple but it was a rip-off.  Money was given for open bar (a limited amount) and a certain amount was supposed to be held for the wedding party. (about 1/2)  Lots of guests arrived before the wedding party and the bartenders had pretty much burned through the bar tab limit BEFORE the wedding party arrived!  \nBrand drinks were cash bar and my wife and I have our preferences so I paid out of pocket for ALL of our drinks (should have helped with the rest of the guests...BUT)  Anyway, the bar closed off the 'tab' way too early.... I think they just double-billed and ripped us off.  \n\nAt my arrival, I ordered 2 drinks and was charged $18.50 (plus tip)..... 45 minutes later I ordered two more OF THE SAME DRINKS.... CHARGE: $19!!  45 minutes after after that... I ordered the same 2 drinks AGAIN.... charge: $21.50 (before tip) Now.... how/why did the price increase from $18.50 to $21.50 in the course of an hour and a half???? Unless it was a rip off?  (several complaints heard about weak or NO ALCOHOL mixed drinks at $9 apiece) \n\nThe dance floor was ok.  The conversation nooks were good, but I don't like to be taken advantage of.  Complaining at a wedding reception makes you look like a jerk.  Soooo, I'm telling you now.... \n\nI will never go there based on this first and last exposure to this  place.  You'd think they'd try to impress folks at a special occasion like this so those of us might go back on our own.  Instead.... why would I go EXPECTING to get screwed???
0 ||| Unless retro grunge is your thing when going shopping then this Target probably isn't for you or the rest of the population. This Target is obsolete and dirty. Don't waste your time, there are better Targets on the totem pole.
4 ||| What's not to love about furry, feathered or finned creatures? I have cats and dogs (they live with their mom at the moment) so I haven't been able to do nearly as much treat-buying and toy-purchasing as I would like. Instead, I live my life through the squirrels I see foraging in the wooded area behind my apartment. Petsmart is great for the bird seed that squirrels love to \"steal\". It's hard to steal when I'm tossing the stuff off my deck so these cute little ones can gather it.\n\nWhoa. Back to the review. This Petsmart is nearly organized and divided by cats, dogs, etc. Everything is very easy to find, the prices are marked clearly and the staff is helpful.\n\nA-OK!
4 ||| I took my fianc\u00e9 here after looking on Yelp and could not have been happier. The food was great, the service was phenomenal, and the venue is very intimate.  You won't be disappointed.
0 ||| I have been a patient of doctor Larsen's since early 2014. I have seen the other doctor in the practice, Dr. Nelson 3 times though. My husband, my son and myself are all patients at this practice. Each time that I have seen Dr. Larsen in person the experience has been positive while in the appointment but I have had a few instances that the customer service were below my expectation outside of appointments. I will start off by saying that my son is 2 years old. He was there for an appointment that I booked two weeks in advance because it wasn't an emergency and I told the receptionist that I knew flu season was upon us and to make my sons appointment fit what time works for them, as I'm at stay at home mom and can come any time. She chose afternoon. My son and I showed up on time and waited almost an hour past his appointment time. That within it's self is FINE. However, as a two year old in a boring room, my son was getting bored and making noise. I was trying to stop him but that's when the nurse felt it was okay to come in there and almost yell at my son. I was not okay with that. Had THEY been on time with appointments, my son wouldn't have been in there making noises, because we would have been gone. What promoted this review was my today's experience. I was seen Friday in the urgent care. I have the flu and a kidney infection. I'm on several medications and I called this morning to ask if the certain antibiotic I am on would cover a sinus infection and an ear infection because I think I am developing that as well. When the nurse got back to me (she called within a reasonable amount of time) she said yes it would. I then asked if the doctor could write pain medicine and if he didn't write a narcotic then that was okay. His suggestion was to continue what I'm taking and give it a few days, even though I told them my current treatment was not helping. That upset me because there are hundreds of non narcotic medications he could try but I felt that he didn't want to deal with me. I spoke to the office manager and she states that she doesn't think that Northwest Family Physicians can do anything right by me and maybe it is time that I find a new doctor, which I had suggested I would do. I told her while yes, I have has 3 total complaints I have given 2 positive reviews about them too. During one visit a patient rep came in and asked me how my visit was and I told her that the visit was going great and I have a suggestion. I told the patient rep about the incident with my son and my complaint and I suggested maybe getting crayons for small children. The patient rep thought what as a good idea and said she would note that. Today during my call with the office manager she ONLY brought up my negative thoughts. After being here in my bed since Saturday in excruciating pain in my back, I am now looking on my insurance site to find a new doctor. While doctor Larsen is a good doctor, he has stood my husband and my own care. Our opinion seems not to matter to them. They have no patient retention and don't care if they loose a patient. I find that appalling.
4 ||| Just finished late lunch there. Quite surprised to see so many people @ 3 pm on a Sunday. \nFirst, the place looks clean and very much like what we are accustomed in Europe. Second, the menu offers many options to satisfy any hunger. Third, the staff if friendly. Fourth, the food is quite good. Got a gyros plate and never had this quality in Phx area before.\nOverall, a nice little place if you want to experience a good Greek taste in NW Phx (reference: food tasted in Greece a few years ago).
1 ||| I requested a quote on a Cannon Patriot P22 and P40 safe.  Their price was several hundred dollars above Cannon's msrp.  When I inquired about this they replied that Cannon was not their primary safe line and they wanted to steer me to another brand.  Buyer beware of this safe dealer.  This business now operates under the name Stanley Security Solutions.
4 ||| Luckily for me, this restaurant is only a five-minute walk from work so it's always one of my top choices for lunch. The London Broil sandwich wasn't as medium-rare as I'd ordered, but delicious nonetheless. \n\nOne thing I appreciate about this restaurant is the frequency of daily-specials they offer during lunch. Everytime I've gone, they've offered at least two specials of the day, which shows some kitchen character. I'll definitely be back again.
1 ||| Location, location, location. Without it this would be just another mediocre restaurant passing itself off for a great place to eat. In today's amazing world of eateries this joint needs serious reinvention.
0 ||| Let me start off by saying that I love Village Inn; I have always have and I probably always will. But this is the first time I've received horrible service. \n\nI called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn't, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said \"Oh, I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold?\" No, you can't. \n\nDefinitely won't be going back to this location.
0 ||| I arrived to check in at 3:00pm since that was the time stated under the hotel description. I was appalled to see the lobby full of guests that were waiting ahead of me! They claim the CIAA affected housekeeping but come on! The CIAA has been happening in Charlotte for years and they knew how many guests were expected to check out. This is incredibly poor planning and the management should be ashamed for their abilities.
3 ||| We have been coming here for several years and the service and food varies to the day of the week and server. Week days are best, quick and attentive service. Shrimp in chili sauce is one of our favorite but the spiciness varies each time. Flower chicken is good if you like more on the bland side. Pork fried rice is consistently good just wish they could add spouts. Overall this is a fine restaurant
4 ||| When Via Veneto first opened, it was one of the only upscale shoe stores in the city which made it a great place to shop. \n\nThey tend to stick with classic styles - at times feeling outdated. If you're looking for modern & fashion-forward looks, this is not the place for you. They do carry some cool designers like Frye, Giuseppe Zanotti, Stuart Weitzman and...they have great espadrilles, made in Spain.
3 ||| Jean-Marc has the BEST cake and pastries in all of Pittsburgh (if not the state and/or country).  Seriously, how can you go wrong with someone who uses such fresh ingredients?  I don't even like chocolate cake with white icing - but I love Jean-Marc's half and half cake!  I also am obsessed with the raspberry filling... yum for fresh raspberries!  The icing is just out of this world.  The pastries are also delicious.  I love the salted caramel macarons... so good.  And the original reason that we found him (in the 90s) was because my grandmother (who was born in France) wanted to try his croissant, which are also delicious. \n\nHe can also be helpful in a pinch.  I forgot to place an order for my mom's birthday cake until really late.  But he helped me out and was very nice about it (but always be nice in return, because he doesn't take any crap!  good for him!).\n\nWe had our wedding out of state, and the only thing that I was disappointed about was the fact that we wouldn't be able to have Jean-Marc's cake for our wedding!
4 ||| Great food! Great Service by Theresa! Great Atmosphere! Loved everything about it! Beware it is 21 & Over ONLY! I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.
0 ||| WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. \nWOULD NOT LET ME ON THE FLIGHT BECAUSE THEY OVERBOOKED IT, AND THEN REFUSED TO REFUND ME AND MY FAMILY....EVEN THOUGH I HAD A REFUNDABLE TICKET. \nBought flight tickets in January for a trip down the Grand Canyon that left the following morning at 6am. They canceled our flight in March and rescheduled us for a later flight. Then 3 days prior to our flight they told us they overbooked our flight and could only take 9 out of the 11 people they booked. After more than 15 calls to them including the corporate headquarters they said they absolutely would not compensate us for having to drive to our destination now, there was no way they could guarantee our flight unless arrived onsite 24 hours in advance (no more no less), and that they had no idea if or how they could refund our flight. Despite us having to miss our entire trip that cost thousands of dollars by telling us 3 days prior to our departure that they are unable to take us to our destination. They are also unfortunately the only airline that flys into this site. We arrived 3 hours before the plane took off, but they would not let us on the plane, and refused to refund our tickets. We lost all of the money, were stranded in page, and had to spend 400$ on a one way rental care to page. I would rather drive anywhere than deal with this airline ever again. Worst customer service. I can't imagine a less reliable company....in any part of the world.
3 ||| I think Hootie B. nails it on this one. In my experience, the service is \"hit or miss\" but for the price and quality, it's a nice find. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I would stop by if in the area and jonesing for sushi.
3 ||| Connecting thru PHX on the way to ANC. PHX is pretty efficient at moving you thru. I Like the upgraded water fountains that allow the easy fill of water bottles. Not too thrilled with the removal of a lot of the Starbucks and replacing with \"local\" coffee bars. Some of them aren't that good. pHX could use most electronic device charging stations. For a big airport, it's pretty decent.
1 ||| I walked in there today prepared to buy a motorcycle for my son walked around 10 people looked at me not even one person said hello hi good morning anything I walked out I will buy a motorcycle elsewhere
3 ||| They have recently re-printed the menu, as the pricing is a little higher.  But the quality of the food is great, their service is fast, even in \"rush hour\" they still get the food out of the kitchen and on to the table.  I like the 'Sonoran' with it's cheese sauce and the 'Papas con Chile'...   This is Mexican food at it's finest for a chain restaurant.  On the Border needs to learn a few tricks from these guys.
4 ||| I just revisited this place and had a darn good lunch with very good service from Jamie.  I didn't go the bbq route for fear of being disappointed again, but the chicken fried steak here is VERY good (probably the best I've had in Vegas).  The yummy fried okra did not disappoint, and the cucumber salad was delightful--a lovely summery accompaniment to any meal.  The strawberry lemonade was delicious, too...a smidgen on the sweet side for me, but a squeezed-in lemon wedge did the trick beautifully to make it pretty close to perfect!  I was coveting a cop's luscious looking banana pudding served in a mason jar a few tables over, but, alas, the meal left no room for dessert...maybe next time!
4 ||| Love love love Komol! The food here is so good! I don't like the area or the actual restaurant, it's very old and dirty looking inside. The only time I get food from here is when I'm working, so we usually get it delivered, so the first time that they didn't have a delivery person available I had to go pick up our food and when I walked in I was surprised to see that this awesome food has come from this place! I wouldn't come here at night, but I will never stop ordering from work!\n\nBest pad Thai and Thai beef salad!
2 ||| you get what you pay for -- that's all i can say about this hotel.\n\nhad to stay here because we decided to stay an extra night and this was the only place my friends could afford.\n\nnote to self: do not come to vegas with broke friends!
0 ||| Rico's Martial Arts is a total rip off. Mickey Rico will shake your hand while going straight for your wallet. They are constantly up selling everything there. Everthing you do there costs more and more money. The last straw for me was when they started giving half-belts. That way they can charge you twice as much, twice as often.  I don't know how they sleep at night. Mickey Rico would be better suited as a used car salesman.
0 ||| I'm into these long winded reviews...don't have the time.   This place is not any good.  Don't waist your money.
4 ||| New and used games, informative and knowledgeable gamers behind the counter. My boyfriends favorite hangout. Nuff said.
4 ||| I love this place!\n\nI grew up in southern California and I think I know a little something about mexican food.  This place rocks!  The food is inexpensive and they give you huge portions.  The chips are always fresh and the salsa is great.  The burritoes are big and tasty.  I wish I could live in San Diego and eat here every day.  I lived in Henderson for 8 months and I was a regular here.  This is a must stop in for me every time I visit Vegas.\n\nYummmy
4 ||| This place is good for a solid, artery clogging cheesesteak.  \n\nI popped in here tonight after a stressful day and picked up a philly and some fries.  You can get it \"wit wiz\" here which is a detail that a lot of places in Phoenix miss when they're trying to replicate a good cheesesteak.\n\nThat being said, it ain't philly, but it's good for Phoenix and the price.  It's super filling and delicious enough so that you wolf it down fast enough that you regret eating it.\n\nDomestic beers here are pretty cheap too!\n\nThe one detractor is the customer service.  I've been here a few times and it's really hit or miss.  Never been terrible but sometimes can be a little far from awesome.  Still though, it's fast food right?\n\nCheck it out!!!!
3 ||| Their al pastor really stood out for me. The  salsa verde was great and had a good amount of heat. The salsa roja was overly smoky/chipotle-y for my taste. The al pastor burrito or tacos and some salsa verde washed down with a jamaica: Uuummmm.  Worth the drive to a sketchy area.
0 ||| Like other people who gave low rating to this place, my experience was somewhat similar.\n\nFirst of all, how the world could this place charged me a to-go BBQ duck rice for $10.25?!  \nYou can get better deal in other BBQ joint at Jones ave.  I felt like I was eating garbage, I could only finished half of the food because it did not taste good.\n\nThe quality of duck was so-so, very little duck meat and too grease.   To make my experience worst, the service person added too much soy sauce to my rice, to test my sodium intake to a daily new high.   I can't convince myself to come back anytime soon.  Strike One.
2 ||| I think I actually want to give China Palace four stars, but I am not sure yet... \n\nI avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . \n\nI really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. \n\nThey do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. \n\nLast night, I tried the \"Sizzling Sensation\" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. \n\nSpeaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the \"Taro Bowl A-La-King.\" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... \n\nIf you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or \"weight watchers\" items. That goes for just about anywhere! \n\nDelivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly.
4 ||| Great service and wines. Best calamari in town
0 ||| This place is a joke. They hold on to your tapes for weeks on end, you can never get ahold of them by phone, their mailbox is full and they're rarely even open during their business hours. Unprofessional and poor quality. Stay away! Rip off!
3 ||| I was starving. Went up to the counter and asked the girl what their most popular sub was and she didn't know.... Guy working the toaster knew immediatly \"Turkey-Bacon sub\" told him to do that for me exactly how everyone else likes it.  Few minutes later my sandwich gets called out.  This sandwich was simply amazing.  I loved it.  I ate the whole thing.  My fiance says my opinion means nothing since I was starving and a pig's ass would have pleased my taste buds at the time.  I disagree. My sandwich was bomb and I will return another time when I am not as hungry and see who's right.
1 ||| This place has really gone downhill over the past few years. I've been going here for about 3 years (work in the area) and I've seen it go through many changes and it has changed owners and as the new owners continue to change things.\n\nFirst, smoking lounge is gone and they're now making way for the \"Blue Adobe Trading Post\" where they will continue to sell the horribly tacky, garish, and overpriced rhinestone handbags, shirts, and belts that they've been selling at the bar section recently.\n\nIt also seems like they change out the furniture every two months or so. I don't get why they keep doing this, how they can afford to buy so much furniture, and what the reason for it is. The place is also kept a little too dark for what its trying to be.\n\nThe menu used to be pretty large, but is pretty overpriced for what they offer and for the place. They cut the menu down to a page or two a few weeks ago, but it is still overpriced.
2 ||| Shopping - I hate it. Except for the PGA Superstore - but that is another review.  Anyway, we were hungry, so we decided a pizza sounded good. Nello's is in the same shopping center, so we decided a pizza sounded good - plus they had beer.  \n\nThe inside is neat, clean, and boring.  But we were there to eat pizza, so my wife had a spinach salad, and we shared a Grand Deluxe Pizza (pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, onions, black olives & mushrooms). And, of course, beer.\n\nThe service was excellent - we were immediately seated and a server appeared immediately to take our drink orders; brought them right back, and took our order. And it was only a short wait for the food.\n\nMy wife really enjoyed the spinach salad; and the pizza toppings were above average.  They pride themselves on their crust, which I found was better than average.  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is that I found the sauce rather bland.\n\nPizza is really a matter of individual taste, so others may like the pizza much better than I did.  I will certainly come here again, and maybe upgrade my stars if the sauce is a little spicier.
0 ||| I went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience. We got there early, and there were only a few people working there. This resulted in us waiting quite a bit to be seated and to get service. We both got the make your own pasta and I got a side caesar salad. I had to wait with my salad for a long time because I didn't have a fork....pretty weird. I felt like I was in coming to America or something. The food was completely bland. I had a mix of arrabiata sauce and garlic...two strong flavors....yet it had no flavor. I just wish I remembered how much this place is not good before I decide to go there again.
0 ||| I had a very bad experience here about a year ago. The staff at the front desk charged me the wrong amount and was very rude to me when I addressed that. The staff was very unprofessional. In addition, later the insurance company sent me the info which was different from what they charged me. I didn't want to adders this again to the staff since they do not have the capacity to do the math and I didn't want to deal with it again. So I just sucked it up. Dr. Carr recrowned my old crown, put too much anesthesia during the process and I felt like a subject when Dr. treated me. Later on, another dentist told me that they didn't need to recrown my old crown in fact. This was the worst dentist visit I ever had.
2 ||| Unfortunately I would just say this place is average. First of all their menu hasn't changed in I don't know how long but I remember getting the same thing over and over again. They have an interesting pasta that has brie and Walnuts.   I don't eat walnuts so I asked if they could leave them out. Which one would think would be a very simple thing to do. But they gave me some song and dance about how they couldn't leave the walnuts out which to me means their food is premade and I don't like that.  So instead I get a bowtie pasta with just vegetables but I swear I think they just use canned olives in it.  Now they serve you warm bread and butter which is an excellent way to start a meal and a decent wine list and pasta is pasta and it's always a yummy thing to eat however it's just done average here.
4 ||| First time at Farm at South Mountain. What a hidden gem!  Beautiful gardens, shops, restaurants and mini-community. \n\nOur table (all the tables) was set on a shaded patio with gorgeous views of the naturally-landscaped gardens. My wife ordered the American Breakfast, while I had the Morning Glory Spinach Benedict.  The drinks were self serve. \n\nOur meal arrived in five minutes. She got two eggs, sausage, skillet potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. The eggs were cooked perfectly, along with the crisp/soft potatoes. My plate had toasted muffins, cooked spinach, loads of farm ham, poached eggs with loads of hollandaise, plus the same yummy potatoes. \n\nThe meal was excellent. A little pricey ($33 for the two meals and two drinks, plus tip) but absolutely worth it. The service was outstanding and the view: all five stars. \n\nThis was one of the best breakfasts I've had in my LIFE, considering the whole package. \n\nGet here!  They close for summer.
4 ||| This is a great place to hike in the valley! There are so many different trails here that very in length and challenge. Yesterday, a friend of mine and I took advantage of the beautiful weather and went up an unmarked area of the mountain. It was pretty much straight up, and my legs still are hurting, but it was totaly worth it.  I honestly don't know where exactly we were, but when we reached summit there was an awesome rock formation at the top, and an excellent view of nearly the entire valley!
4 ||| I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.  The food quality is high and consistant.  The prices are downright CHEAP.  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.
4 ||| X Shadyside is a no frills type of gym (no pool, sauna and hot tub) but gets the job done. They just revamped the entire first floor with more workout machines and weights. A downside of the renovation is that there are less tv channels to choose from (no more Bravo). The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful; and the bathrooms are kept clean (what more can you ask for?).\n\nThe convenience of being able to walk to X Shadyside especially in the winter and their flexible hours are huge pluses so I'm okay with the monthly price that I am paying.\n\nI am looking forward to Planet Smoothie opening next door.
4 ||| In my trinity of favorite Pittsburgh Indian restaurants, India Garden holds the title of \"best buffet\" for sure - there is nothing more relaxing than wandering in on a Sunday afternoon for great Indian comfort food with Bollywood or cricket playing on the TV.  Lots of people have the same idea, so the food on the buffet turns over pretty quickly, and they have a good variety (Do you like goat curry? They have that.) which changes slightly from week to week, so THEORETICALLY you could eat here several weekends in a row and not get bored. Theoretically.  Is the food super-spicy? No, but it is incredibly tasty, and the whole experience feels very comfortable - we've never had an issue with service because we've never come here for a meal off the menu - just buffet. And have been very happy every time.  Maybe that's the secret.\n\nThe biggest inconvenience is not the crazy parking on Atwood, it's that India Garden recently changed their weekend buffet hours so they close for a brief period between lunch and dinner. Plan on lunch around lunchtime and you'll be fine.
3 ||| Decent for a chain, food really salty thou and the prices are higher than 'typical' chiense places but the quality is a lot better,
0 ||| Those jerks left a old part floating in my gas tank. \n\nIt caused problem with my gas gauge and I ran out of gas and had to walk for 2 hours in the middle of night against 30 MPH wind. \n\nHere is the story: \n\nMy \"check engine\" light was on, so I took my 2002 Camry to this place. \n\nOne hour later, they call me and told me some valve in the gas tank needed to be replaced. It's $500. If I decide not to fix it, it's $110 for checking the car. And they recommended a lot of other \"repairs\" I might want to do. All together would be $1500. \n\nWhat is this?? Somebody call the police. I am being robbed. \n\nI told them to just take care of the \"check engine\" light problem first. \n\nI picked up my car within one hour. And it's $500 for one hour of work. I started reading the bill, they charged me a new gas cap for $55 and that's before the labor cost. \n\nThat's when I swore to myself never again coming to dealership to repair anything. \n\nOne year later, I took the car to the repair sho to fix the gauge after the 2 hours walk home. They told me some body left behind a piece of old part broke off from a valve floating in the gas tank. \n\nUnbelievable!!!
0 ||| RUN!!! Not only am I being charged 4X what I was told... he hit a nerve and I cannot feel part of my face. I was told.. oooh no big deal, it will come back in 6 weeks. It has now been 4 months and I still do not have full feeling restored. I was sent to collections without even getting my last bill in the mail. Please save your FACE and yourself major aggravation.
4 ||| I love getting all dolled up and going to South Park Mall!  Dont show up here (or anywhere really please) in your sweats and hoodie!\n\nPlease get an H&M!!!!  Other than that everything I love is here...always clean and classy :-D
1 ||| I grew up in Squirrel Hill and have been going to the Squirrel Hill Flower Shop for the 20 years I lived there and then phoning in orders for the ten years since I left. I felt loyal to them since they're a local business in my neighborhood. But they are so consistently unpleasant when I phone, and seem disinterested in my business and reluctant to help me to select flowers. For example, this morning when I phoned:\n\nme: I'd like to send flowers to my mother.\nthem: we're only doing open (\"open-something\" - I can't remember the term).\nme: what is that?\nthem: designer choice\nme: what is that?\nthem: the florist puts stuff together\nme: can you describe anything more about the \"stuff\"?\nthem: no, we can't tell you the type of flowers or colors.\nme: well, it's hard to spend money on something when you know nothing about it. can I get it without the vase.\nthem: yes. it's $50 plus $10 deliver.\nme: and without the vase?\nthem: it's still $50.\n\nSo I declined and found, through Yelp, Alex's flowers on Craig Street, where the owner was very charming and descriptive about the flowers and what he could put together, and very reassuring that the bouquet would be beautiful.
1 ||| Very small \"large\" sundaes in my opinion. Food is very mediocre.
0 ||| Okay being spoiled for so long was completely disappointed yesterday at the wash.. I had to go back over the car with a rag right there in front of them.. was bullshit that I was having to clean my own fucking car at the car wash.. I could have went to the cheapy place over by my house and got a better wash for half the price.  Still pissed!\n\nHand job indeed!
4 ||| I'm HUGE SNL fan, so naturally if someone who's been in the cast is touring, I'll come here to see them. Some have been really great...Jim Breuer. Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!\n\nA couple downsides.... \n\nWaiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!\n\nThe two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! \n\nAlso, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! \n\nSo what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand. The talent is really what you're there for so, enjoy the show!
0 ||| I wanted to order a cake for my son first birthday. I went to the store, as I like the cake designs on their website.\n\nI didn't ordered right away but got four cupcakes to go: chocolate, vanilla , lemon and  red velvet .The lady told me those were basically same as the(some of the) cake flavors. I am sad to say they were: dry, very dry, so dry and super dry :(  And I went in the morning! After that I decided not to order from them.\n\nMaybe it was a fluke but that's not good when you're trying to sell cakes:-s\n\nMy rating is based on the cakes/cupcakes.
2 ||| Ok, nothing special.  There was nothing wrong with this location, it was clean and friendly enough.  My drink was made so sweet that I almost couldn't drink it though, and some of the decorations were in a little bit of disarray.
2 ||| Amazing must see place. Live entertainment and the organ wall is just so cool. I didn't like how it was crowded after only an hour after opening for dinner but its just that popular. I'm sure the food was good but we couldn't find a place to sit and the lines look long for drinks and food too and I didn't see servers
2 ||| Extremely mediocre food, served by delightful, friendly people.That's the best way to describe this place.\n\nWe ordered California Rolls, and found them small, dry and not flavorful. Much like Grocery Store packaged sushi.\n\nThe edamame was the worst I have ever had. It was obviously just 'nuked' and some of the beans had white areas on them from frost burn in their freezer. Really, avoid these!\n\nThe teriyaki chicken bowls, which we were expecting based on the reviews here to be delicious, were only . . . \"so so\" at best. The meat was chewy, there was some gristle thrown in for good measure, and in general, it was a big disappointment. I went in on a Groupon type special and felt that we got our money's worth, but just barely.\n\nOn the positive side, the serving size was nice on the bowl, and the women serving/making the food were very sweet and friendly. I hope their business does well, but I assure Yelpers that it will require them to upgrade their quality or this place won't be there long.
0 ||| This dentist office is the king of the up-sell and unnecessary procedures.  Communications are not complete and thorough.  It seems from my experience with this office that everyone is incentivize to sell more procedures, products and service plans.  All I have gotten from the staff is you need to do this or that and we will get you on a recurring plan for the health of your teeth.  I need facts about dental health, not up sells to make the dentist who owns this practice more money.  Beware of this element of this specific dentist office.\n\nOwners comments are they can't find me in there database, but they can find me well enough to send me an invoice for additional services.  I paid all charges at the time my appointment was completed, and now I receive another charge via mail.  My comments stand, beware of this practice.
4 ||| I have played hockey here for years.\nThe facilities are decent and the employees are friendly and helpful, I have become friends with many of them.\nThe league prices are reasonable, compared to other facilities in town.\nThere is a decent amount of teams and leagues for all levels.\nThe game times for league hockey and pick-up hockey can be demanding, late times during the week, some after 10 pm. The priority is public skating and high school hockey. I guess they realize they can get away with it.\nThe ice is usually pretty good, the locker rooms fairly clean. There is a pro shop with a limited supply of hockey/skating products for sale and the prices are pretty steep.\nNever had anything from the snack bar, but they offer items from hot chocolate to nachos. \nKids birthday parties are available as well as private bookings and ice rental.
2 ||| I was not happy when after i paid for my families meal to find not attended to buffet. The place sprung a major leak in the dinning area during the storm last night. The food, the nacho cheese was more water then cheese & the fruit had sat out far to long that it smelled & tasted funny.... Not to mention the salad was NO way fresh. \nOn the up side the customer service was great.
3 ||| \"Asian Fusion\" not sure I agree with the concept... I've eaten at two of these restaurants, the one near Tempe, and the one in north Scottsdale...  The food is good, the place trendy... the Scottsdale location has a nice outdoor seating area, nice for a date when the weather is correct...
1 ||| So they used to have strawberry lemonade on their menu. If you go here and order a strawberry lemonade or a quencher lemonade the only difference is one has some canned strawberries added and cost two dollars more without refills. Asked for the manager and he clearly admitted that the picture in the menu is very misleading. The menu shows what looks like a premium drink and what we got was from the fountain. Applebee's in general is declining in quality and atmosphere but this location has been particularly hit hard. Service is bad and waiters and waitresses are a mess. The food here tastes like they just pour salt on everything way too much. You shouldn't have to Yelp Applebee's but I found it very comical that the menu and what you actually get has such a discrepancy.
0 ||| And still 2 and a half weeks later and still no furniture. We did get a call saying that 2 of the four chairs were  going to be arriving next week, while the last fourth chair won't be coming til November. Why are you selling stuff you don't have in stock. If I knew I wouldn't be getting a full dining room set, I wouldn't have bought it. I guess that's why you don't tell us. Hate devious business practices. And I work in retail. Will Never recommend you guys to even my enemies.
0 ||| I feel like I can't find a good nail place in the area! This is my second review of a nail salon and I have started to give up hope. This time I walked in to get a manicure. I was seated fast and asked what color. The nail technician started fast. She started to shorten my nails and use a cuticle clipper. She was moving way to fast and accidentally sliced the side of my fingernail. I had to tell her to stop so that I can go and wash my hand. I washed my hand, but the bleeding wouldn't stop. I asked if I could just get a band aid, but the technician poured acetone on the cut. When all was said and done, the technician apologized, but i was left with the full bill. Customer service regarding this incident was extremely poor. I will never go back!
0 ||| 5/9/14: I saw they had remodeled so I decided to give them another try.  As I approaches the door I was greeted with clouds of cigarette smoke from the server who was standing at front corner smoking.  I approached the podium and waited.  Another server was on the phone and I heard her mention \"Medicaid\".  Since that is not an item served at Coco's, I assume it was a personal call. Eventually she said she would be with me in a minute.  She then leaned against the back counter and continued her call. Based on previous bad experiences, my smokey entry, the lack of making guests the first priority, and the district manager never following through on her previous call to me, I will never return.  I will share my experiences with everyone in my office as well, which is just down the street - over 300 people.  \n\n3/7/13: No change.  Slow service to be seated.  Poor maintenance. Tables had excessive wear marks from use as plates sliding across them.  Dirty walls near booth.
4 ||| Despite the what is hopefully an unintentional innuendo in the restaurant name, the food is absolutely delicious. My husband and I were craving Asian food and decided to explore the areas off the strip. Intrigued by the name and prompted by good yelp reviews, we decided to try it out. We both ordered the standard Pho Tai (rice noodles in beef broth) and loved it. The noodles did not clump together like at other restaurants and appeared to be cooked to order. The soup broth was flavorful and very refreshing. I would definitely recommend it. And in Vegas style, the restaurant is open 24 hours!
3 ||| Love this place. Jock looks good although he may give the groomers a hard time because of a broken jaw. They take good care of him
4 ||| These guys are good.  I go into at least two different Home Depots a day this one by far is the best.  Sharon near the pro check out always has a smile on her face doesn't matter what time of day it is.  I go out of my way to go to the store when I can.
4 ||| I had steamed chicken and veggies along with hot and sour soup! I would never get tired of it!
0 ||| This Credit Union is a joke.  As the other reviews are dead on.  They charge you for everything, and I  mean everything.  And if you have over $25,000.00 in the bank, they start to charge you a maintenance fee....So, basically, the more you deposit, the more they take.  And forget about calling and getting answers, or even going in there, if you don't have a full day to waste. Please do yourself a favor, go elsewhere.
0 ||| We've lived in the area for four years now and finally decided to try this place out this morning. The wait took a while, which we get, it's Father's Day. However, once we got seated, it became the most stressful breakfast I've ever encountered. One of the waitstaff was literally running around like a chicken with her head cut off, barking orders at the other staff who were doing their best at keeping up with the throng of people there to enjoy breakfast. One of my sons (6 years old) doesn't like breakfast food, so when he attempted to order chicken tenders, and we were told (by the barky waitress) that the fryers weren't on and he could only have breakfast, we totally understood. Makes sense! I attempted to order him a grilled cheese as it doesn't require a fryer, and she downright refused and left our table, saying \"figure it out\"! My son is really upset at his point because he's hungry and tired from waiting, and they can't seem to make him a grilled cheese. I have a feeling if I'd ordered him a \"breakfast sandwich on toast with only cheese\" it wouldn't have been a problem, but for some reason, a grilled cheese for a six year old was too much to ask. He ended up eating toast, and I made him a grilled cheese when we got home. We ordered an Eggs Benedict (pretty good, not nearly the best I've had) and husband ordered a burrito (we could have made the equivalent at home, just as well). The other woman who brought our food was very delightful, nice and accommodating to the best she could be. While there, I observed a family (also with a very young child, about 2) who was brought their food, and spent about four minutes trying to gain the attention from anyone working (all the while, everyone avoided making eye contact with this family) there because they did not have utensils to eat with. The woman from that table eventually got up and went to the back to ask someone for silverware. We love supporting small businesses and are always looking for new ones to try out, but unfortunately, this one, we will not be returning to.
2 ||| This place is nothing to write home about. It is about as good as Denny's. \nFries are not so great. Burger was ok.
2 ||| Pretty good little pho joint. My regular lunch posse (that is what I like to call them - because it sounds better than me and 4-6 engineering dudes) wound up here today somewhat by accident, but overall I think we were very pleased with the service and the pho. \n\nThe gents all ordered their usual beef pho and I had a chicken in a beef broth. The servings were huge. One of my companions ordered the large bowl, which would have been enough to feed three small children (or this guy). We eat at a lot of Vietnamese restaurants on our lunch outtings and one of my regualar cohorts recently made the best Pho I have ever tasted - so our expectations may run a little  high. So, a 3 star review from me for pho is a pretty good one. I'll definitely head back to try out some of the other menu items soon.
4 ||| Pittsburgh is not known for its Asian cuisine, but Sushi Kim's might just be the most popular Korean restaurant in the city.  I've been here just a couple times.  The venue is by no means impressive.  The decor is very dated and dark.  Whatever you do, do not drink the water.  My friend claims that it made him sick to his stomach.  Pittsburgh is not well known for its tap water.  I'm going to take a water bottle with me the next time I go.\n\nThe first time, I went a friend and I had the kalbi and the mandu.  It was palpable, but nothing special.  I've heard that the kalbi is one of the better things on the meal, but I personally don't like eating with my hands.\n\nThe second time, another friend of mine introduced me to soondubu.  I got the vegetable only soondubu, while my friend got the regular soondubu.  Soondubu is a spicy tofu based soup.  Traditionally, it is served with vegetables and shellfish.  My friend was kinda disappointed with the regular, because it only had shrimp. For me, the vegetable soondubu hit the spot!  On a cold winter's day, this spicy soup was absolutely perfect!  Craving to go back again!\n\nI've heard the BBQ dinner is very good!
0 ||| I had been to Macayo's numerous times not because I wanted my colleagues like the place. Every time I go I notice the value of the food and taste is getting worst. Today I went and ordered Chicken Fajitas with side veggies. The fajitas didn't come out sizzling they looked like they must have sat in the window for awhile. The veggies are ice cold with tons of butter and barely cooked. The chicken tasted like they been freezer burned and no seasoning. The dish wasn't appetizing at all.  Also, I service isn't the best  I was with a group and had leftovers and wanted a box and the server didn't even come around. Just drop off the check and walk away. I wouldn't recommend going to this place if you want some good Mexican food.
1 ||| Went there for lunch because I heard this place has sandwiches. I bought the Southwestern Chicken flatbread for almost $5. When they pulled it out of it's little bag to cook it  I just about asked for my money back. The thing was small for the price but I guess they are basing it on the calories. It isn't really that bad but I'm still hungry. Probably would not go there for the sandwiches anymore but just for the smoothies.
1 ||| Basketball court is a serious safety hazard. I expect better up keep from a national brand as LA Fitness. The associates at the front desk are unprofessional and sloppy. Yes it's a gym but class is required in any establishment.
2 ||| Stsy away from.the ruban. Paper thin  corned beef and little of it. Service was fine. Place is a little on the greasy side
4 ||| Why does something so great, have to be so far from my domicile?\nThis is some rich, creamy, eggy goodness.  I thought I could handle two scoops no problem.  One is definitely enough, but if you're up for the man vs. food challenge, go for the triple scoop.  Food comas never tasted so good.
3 ||| Have you thought of downtown Chandler lately? It's got a lot of personality and great Mexican food. Their patio is great. Be prepared to wait on a weekend night.\n\nI like the tacos and the house margarita. Music can be a bit loud.
2 ||| Great location, very dated, friendly slow staff, awful food!  All frozen or canned food here. Wife ordered a walleye sandwich...fish fillet from McDs is better. I ordered the seafood wrap with crab meat...how about no all inside was tuna and acidic watery mayo. Stay away....you've been warned!
4 ||| I just had the best interview with Ms Townsend.  Not only was she kind, she was just brilliant in the analysis of my employment issue. Even though I was calling for a friend, and from out of state, she took the time to direct me (and my friend) to another attorney who could best serve our needs.
0 ||| There are two things I cannot stand: bad service and parking tickets. Luckily I only had one tonight.\n\nI had read several reviews saying the service was slow here, so I came prepared to wait. I did not, however, come prepared for a waitress that made eye contact but steered clear of our table for ten minutes while we tried to point out she brought the wrong appetizer. When she finally made it over, she said it was what we ordered even though we clearly said something else (do tempe and tahu sound similar to you?).\n\nMy dining partner, being polite, did not demand we get our original appetizer, much to my chagrin.\n\nAfter that debacle, it took a good twenty minutes to get our food. The food was good, but I had wanted a papaya dish several yelpers said they loved, and they were out of papaya.\n\nAll in all, the food was relatively good though didn't strike me as particularly authentic (I've had the same dishes at Laotian and Thai places), but the service killed it.\n\nI can understand being busy and not having time to come over, but we were one of four tables. I can understand making a mistake on an order, but then you offer to bring the correct dish. \n\nAll said, won't be going back.
0 ||| Meh.  I've definitely experienced better.  Way better.\n\nService was pretty horrendous here during my recent visit.  Granted, we had a group of 19 so I guess it was a bit understanding.  Our orders were mixed up and the person bringing our orders went around our table asking who ordered what.  Many times, he came to our tables with a dish that no one ordered and asked whether we ordered it.  It was pretty chaotic.\n\nThe food was also horrendous.  The Pho we received were not hot, tasted mediocre, and they seriously should reconsider naming their Pho #1.   Horrible Pho.  I also ordered the Bun Nem Nuong and it was equally as horrendous.  The noodles were hard, the nem nuong were chewy, and the egg rolls were meh. \n\nI will never go back here.
0 ||| I'm sorry but I must agree with several of the most recent reviews. Having been a long time customer of Bagel Nosh, I've seen this particular location change hands twice in the past. Both times there were changes, but they were minimal. The biggest disappointment is the poor quality with this new ownership. The bagels are smaller and don't taste the same. Two Saturdays ago, there was a group of high school track students who had come in after their morning training run. I expected service to be slow that morning, and it was. But that's okay, I was glad that the store had a lot of business. But the person who took my order must have lost the order or gave it to someone else because the woman who finally put my order together came out and asked me three times what my order was. After waiting 25 minutes, she came out and asked me again. I was just about ready to say don't worry about it, you've obviously got your hands full, and just ask for my money back. But instead, I repeated my order to her. Ten minutes later she came out with my order. This morning hubby and I decided to try again. We placed our order (2 bagels with cream cheese and an Arizona Classic bagel sandwich). I presented my loyalty punch card which I've accumulated (finally!) enough purchases to earn a free sandwich. Under this new ownership, I was told that my punch card was no longer honored. Having purchased businesses myself, I feel it is poor practice to not extend good will to past loyal customers while building new relationships, especially for something as inexpensive as a bagel sandwich. It's a good thing I've got Kokabelli Bagel shop not far away as I doubt I'll be coming back.
4 ||| Dear Harris Teeter,\n\nI would just like to let you know how much I love you. You are so big and clean with the best layout a supermarket has ever seen. Your service is top notch and the staff is so helpful and sweet I think I got diabetes the last time I was there. Oh and the online shopping service you have is so convenient and organized! Thank you Harris Teeter for being so awesome.\n\nYou make me miss the suburbs...\n\nLove,\n\nLauren B
4 ||| I have eaten here three or four times, mostly because a friend at work really likes the suppli (risotto balls).  Their food is okay.  I have a simple test for any restaurant to classify as being at least 'good' it must make me close my eyes.  Never happened here with any dish I've tasted, suppli included.  And they serve Pepsi products....echhhhh....the ultimate sign of a cheap-ass restaurant owner...\nThe service is friendly though and it's always good to get out with Melissa!!
0 ||| Went to the drive thru to get some food. Apparently the manager thought it was a brilliant idea to take an unusually large order through the drive thru and inconvenience the rest of us that were waiting in the neighborhood of 15 plus minutes in line behind this genius or geniuses that placed said order in the drive thru!! This was totally ridiculous and they had a delivery at the same time so there was a semi blocking the parking lot as well!! WTH I finally backed out of the drive thru and left in disappointment!! You geniuses have lost my business for good! I'll never come back and will tell everyone i know to go elsewhere as well!! That was the dumbest most inconsiderate experience I've ever had in my life!! Its a drive thru to expedite service not hinder it!! You should be ashamed of yourselves!! Never again will you treat me badly! I hope you close your doors!! Btw time was 9:20pm  on sat 4-19-14  TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3 ||| Is this the best Vietnamese food I've ever had? No, but for the price it's pretty decent without having to drive all the way to Chandler. Two bowls of pho and two orders of goi cuon for $15-16 is a steal. Very homely taste to the broth and finally a place where goi cuon is inexpensive (it's $2.50 for two pieces). The Vietnamese music in the background and the decent amount of Vietnamese people dining inside add to the authenticity of the place. \n\nBut beware of the shady area it's in. Located in a tiny strip mall in a not so great area of Phoenix, I would not feel comfortable driving a really nice car here. Or if you had to because it's your only form of transportation, then I'd recommend parking it in front of the restaurant where you can at least keep an eye on it through the windows while you're eating. Probably not the cleanest restaurant either but I'll keep coming back until I find a reason to not to lol.  \n\nWhen I have a craving for Vietnamese food I'll be back to have my fill until I can make it back home and eat some good food in San Jose.
0 ||| I agree with Jenna M. - Barr Real Estate is terrible! I moved into one of their new complexes called Karma, and I thought I'd gotten a great deal because it's close to downtown Champaign and was furnished with all new furniture. But the heat/cooling system always breaks, and I was freezing all winter. Also, leasing agents and maintenance men are always coming into your apartment to show it. One time I was resting in my bedroom and a maintenance man came into my apartment without knocking! And then today, my car was towed from the spot I pay for at my complex because apparently I wasn't parked precisely in between the lines. I will not sign with this apartment complex, or with the Barr Real Estate ever again. And you shouldn't either...
0 ||| 5/5/11\n\nWalked in at 3:30p for a mani/pedi and was told the earliest would be at 4p.  Once she penciled me in, I left to wait it out at the Starbucks next door.  There isn't a buzzer system, so keep this in mind if you do go.\n\nThis space is large, clean, bright, and bustling!  I've never seen so many nail artists busy at work at one time.  I met Luanne, who was friendly, efficient, and did a very good job painting my toes and fingers.  My only two complaints are that 1.) she cut too deeply on my left big toe and aggravated a previous wound, thus the area has been painfully-raw since (esp. now as I've been on my feet all day on 3-inch heels), and 2.) I really don't appreciate it when I'm paying for a service, and during that service I'm hurt and am told \"You're too sensitive!\"  Umm...  I'll try harder not to draw back in pain the next time you're about to draw blood, OK?\n\nMani/pedi cost has gone up since another review here mentioned it-- t's now $40, and this was the most I've ever paid for the service.  It's also the first time I chose to try gel polish.  It costs $15 extra PER pair-- $5 more than what my sis paid for it in Charlotte.  (Gotta love living in Scottsdale!)  So far, I'd say gel polish is worth the extra cost-- my regular nail polished-nails usually get ruined w/in 30 minutes of my walking out of the salon, even after quick-drying spray was applied.  A day later and the polish still looks immaculate!  The next two days will prove whether or not it was worth the extra cost... watch this space for an update!  :)\n\nPsst!  If you do get gel polish, be sure to apply SPF on your hands/feet beforehand (due to the process of \"setting\" the gel w/ UV rays, I'm assuming you should avoid saturating the nailbeds w/ sunscreen).  While the tech will apply a coat, more than likely he/she won't properly cover the entire area (she didn't w/ mine), and the areas that weren't covered by the coating felt very hot (almost searingly-hot!) under those UV machines.  (Total UV exposure was around 10-12 minutes.)
0 ||| Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, there's lettuce and mayo and... what this? what's this I see in this sandwich? there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didn't finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, I'm calling a local news station to report it, then I'll call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps.
0 ||| So many better places on Spring Mountain.  One dish tastes likes the next at this joint.  The \"white\" chicken is anything but.  Cathay was once one of the best in town.  Not any more.  As they say, \"no more business from me to you!\"
0 ||| We used US Airways to get from Austin, Texas to Nassau, Bahamas.  On the way there, the planes were dirty, but otherwise the trip was uneventful.  On the way back, the plane from Charlotte, NC to  Austin, Texas was HOT!  We were delayed about 30 minutes for \"maintenance issues\" however once aboard the plan I'm not sure what they fixed!  The bathroom toilet would not flush in the front of the plane.  The sink in the bathroom was full of water that would not drain.  And the plane did not cool off until about an hour into the flight.  While on our vacation, we heard a comedian say that the theme of US Airways was \"Come fly the other airlines!\" and I think I may have to listen to that logic!
4 ||| Great service, good food, nice patio. If you are in the mood for Greek you can't go wrong. Noteworthy: hummus, Greek fries, pitas, gyros, Greek salad, chicken souvlaki dinner, and mousaka!
1 ||| My wife and her family took me here for my birthday, the service was ok we had about 12 people nothing too big. We had two servers both were pretty nice. We ordered food kept it going like a normal service I got the Bar Harbor and it was pretty awesome I got them to add Cajun seasoning into it since I like spicy food. But rather good couldn't complain.\n\nBUT my wife's grandma got a steak and Lobster, she order a medium and it came out well done and her lobster was raw no idea how this happened considering you cook them at two different times but so be it. She sent it back and by the time she got it back we had already ate all our food and had finished desert. I mean what the heck how does it take that long to cook a medium steak? It doesn't! By the time she got her food she wasn't hungry anymore.\n\nSo we get the checks and the server tells me that the manager comped her food since it was messed up and that we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Well then they gave her another bill and said that she had to pay for it how the hell that works is beyond me, but she was stuck paying for the damn food that the manager told us we would get credited. \n\nNear the end of the service the servers lacked and kind of vanished and it was just a huge cluster. The quality of this place just tanked and fell low.\n\nThe only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb!!! Everything else is a joke.
2 ||| I'll be honest, after reading the reviews for this place, I really, really wanted to love them. The restaurant itself is very clean, inviting, and the staff really sweet. The menu had everything I was looking for on it. I was making a quick stop for lunch before meeting up with someone, figured I had plenty of time.\n\nI placed my order, got some water with lemon in it, and then glanced at my phone - woops - I had miscalculated and was going to be late, especially if I took my time eating! It was totally not their fault, they were on it with the service, it was all on me.\n\nGlad that I hadn't ordered anything more exciting than water, I grabbed my purse and went up to the front counter. I apologized and asked if I could change my order to to-go. She was cool about it. A few minutes later, I had my bagged up lunch and was out the door. I made my appointment in time, and, luckily, it was casual enough that they didn't mind if I whipped out my chopsticks and started munching away.\n\nI had ordered the orange peel chicken. It sounded really good on paper. It tasted like...salt. Honestly, I found nothing really good about it. Nothing really bad, either, just kind of meh, like grocery store Chinese. I had ordered it spicy, and it wasn't. It was just so-so.\n\nJust for the record, when I order \"spicy\" - babes, that means melt my face, curl my hair, steam out my ears spicy. Not just extra salt. Perhaps there was a communication problem?\n\nI gave them three stars (rounded up from 2-1/2, which isn't an option) for service and because I'm willing to come back with the hubby to try other things. Based on the other reviews, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try again. They've been here a long time and I haven't. Maybe we were both having an off day?
2 ||| Taco Bell is Taco Bell...
3 ||| I was looking for a good, mediterranean neighborhood grill, and this place fit the bill.  Although a little overpriced if you're getting non-wrap entrees, the food was delicious and well worth it.  The hummus was really tasty and fresh - a very large serving that could feed (as an appetizer) a packed table of people.  I had the falafel wrap and thought it was near-perfect.  Not dry (like most falafel), and just a wonderful blend of flavors.  My boyfriend had the chicken wrap and didn't love the marinade, but otherwise agreed that it's a great spot.
0 ||| This facility is over rated and not reliable. I asked on a few occasions for requests and the service would brush me off. Granted I'm not in the industry where I wear a white collard shirt everyday, but I deserve to be listen to and taken seriously. It is like a large rock rolling down a hill and no one cares to warn the village. It's damned due to it's size!
2 ||| First off you need to take a cab from the strip to a strip mall some distance away, then you will need to wait in line for 30mts outside in the heat. When we walked they told us the AC was broke and they had some smalls fans set up on the floor. We ordered the Pho, they only have one size ... extra large bowl. The soup was kinda watered down and the meat was a little chewy and a ton of noodles. We went here only because someone from California recommended this place to us...
1 ||| If you don't mind paying a for a package then having added fees, then go there. The place is OK but the package deals are not really as they seem, and they are over priced for what you get. You can not take photos on their grounds and no one except the photographers, they will tell you there is a tipping fee  a recommended price, after you have paid for the package for the limo driver, sermon guy E.T.C. and when you pay 300 plus for photos they will later tell you, you need to go to a pay pal type of thing and pay 10 plus dollars before they deliver the photos. Anyway I would have looked or called other places and went with something much better, for what you get. Hard to believe they were ever rated number 1. If they would have been upfront with all their recommended fees and included them in the package they would have received 3 stars instead of 1.
4 ||| The Nosh is the spot .. Great people , Great service and great food . I've been coming here for over  3 yrs and  every time the experience is AWESOME . Everything is wonderful . Bagels , Salads , Soups etc . If you get a chance please try the Southwest Corn Chowder . Awesome !!!!!
1 ||| I have been going to Harper's for years - YEARS, I tell ya.  Unfortunately I have noticed a marked decline in the quality of their food (at both locations).  Though the portions have remained relatively generous, I would rather have a smaller amount of better food, if that is what is required to up the quality.\n\nAfter an especially harrowing few weeks, the boss decided to reward me for not going on a homicidal rampage by giving me a gift card for Harper's.  So, on a Wednesday evening right after work, off to Harper's I went to spend the balance of my gift card.  I say this only in that if I were spending my own money, rather than the boss man's, I would not have ordered a steak at Harper's, I would save that for a steak place.\n\nTheir menu is on the smaller side, but it contains a variety of beef, chicken, pork and fish dishes.   I decided to splurge and try their prime rib served with a loaded baked potato ($25).  It was an inch thick, medium as requested and looked delicious.  Upon cutting into it - bleh.  Tough and chewy, and the dull knife was not helping out.  I had to saw at the piece of meat to get bites cut and immediately dipped it into the tasty au jus (salty meat juice, yum) to get any kind of flavor.  It honestly tasted like a hunk of meat taken off of the roast beef carving station at some kind of buffet.  Harper's isn't a \"steak\" place, but I expected better.  The loaded baked potato was delicious.  \n\nFor dessert, there was a \"homemade\" pumpkin cheesecake ($6).  It was fine, nothing special.  It was not very creamy, and not very pumpkiny, but that might be a personal preference of mine as far as cheesecake consistency and flavor goes.  I wouldn't bother to order it again.\n\nMy server, Tonji, was spectacular.  She kept my ginger ales coming and continued to check on how my meal was going, without being interruptive.  The manager did stop by and ask how the meal was and I should have spoken up, but I hate being \"that girl\".  \n\nI have spent all of the $50 gift card and wouldn't intentionally return to either of the Harper's locations any time soon - the meal from the Carolina Place location on Saturday was mediocre and the dinner at the Southpark location on Wednesday wasn't anything to write home about either (though the wait staff at both locations was quite good). \n\n(Another piddly comment I have - wait staff shouldn't set up in the rest room changing clothes/getting ready for shift and gossiping.  As a paying guest, I shouldn't have to shuffle around them to get to a stall and then again to wash my hands.)
2 ||| The steak was good, but not particularly impressive at $40 per plate. I got the Surf and Turf special with scallops, and two 5oz filet. The filets were good, cooked perfectly, and great cuts of meat. Just not wowed. The real disappointment was in the scallops that came with the dish. For the class of the place, one expects a certain level, and those scallops didn't even come close.
0 ||| They have an acoustics problem here.  It's horribly loud in there, and everything feels rushed and crushed together.  I had some vegetarian sandwich, it was mediocre and gave me heartburn supreme.  Blah.  \n\nAlso there was an article on MSNBC that revealed that Panera uses additives in their bakery items that cause hyper activity in young children.  \n\nSo if you are looking for a place that's crowded, loud, has mediocre food and pocked with spastic, hyper active children who will gnaw on your leg, go here.
1 ||| This is Las Vegas' version of Tea Station I guess.  The sign said \"Tea Planet\" but everything inside had the Tea Station logo.\n\nI think it's in the Tea Station employee hand book that the servers are supposed to be rude.  We got the same crappy service in Vegas that we would normally get in the San Diego and Los Angeles locations.\n\nOur drinks took a long time to come out (the place was not packed).   We ordered green tea, green milk tea, and peppermint milk tea - they were good though, they tasted the same and the boba had the same consistency as the other locations.    \n\nTheir spicy chicken wings were pretty good, I would have to say better than the San Diego locations.\n\nThis location gets 2 stars because of the bad customer service and the lengthy time it took us to get our drinks.
0 ||| I like Walgreens overall. I've used them in AZ, CO, PA and FL, and until I started using this one, never had a problem.\n\nHowever, in the 9 months I've been here, this one has proven itself more inept than all the other pharmacies I've used in my life...combined. They've lost prescriptions, entered quantity and refill numbers wrong, had their automated system call me saying I had something to pick up when I didn't and not call me when my pills WERE ready (I mentioned this to the pharmacist -- his answer? \"It's a multi-million dollar system, so there are bound to be some errors\"). They haven't known the answers to some questions, have sent me on a merry chase, have charged me for three nuva-rings when they only gave me one...need I go on?\n\nAs soon as this last prescription they've messed up (without telling me) that I'm waiting for comes in, I'll be switching pharmacies. I should have done it months ago. Ugh.
0 ||| Drug dealers hanging around the dumpsters, cars of people parked waiting for their connections, Broken security gates, Pool heater broken longer than the gates have been not working, Palm trees not trimmed, paint falling off the stair rails, Manager who rents to all types of trash.\nThese are only some of the problems associated with Paridise Foothills apt. This place is running down fast, the pools need to be re done, cool deck thats now hot deck. slimy landscaping,  Pool heater broken and the list goes on...\nLaundry room is very run down and over  120 degrees in the summer, of course they lock the doors to keep the run down laundry room safe.\nEven the fountain out by the mail boxes is broken at the top. \nThe low life owner must be turning this place into Section 8 HUD or something is very wrong here!\nIm very happy my lease is up and I can get away from this run down dump.\nPlease dont rent here unless you are a drug dealer and you must supply your own \nHOODIE!
0 ||| Three reasons why I go to Ulta:\n1. They always send coupons every week\n2.I only buy Biolage, Redken or Paul Mitchell when they have the promo (buy 2 get 1 free)\n3.Close to my apt.\n\nPeople that work here aren't really helpful..surprise..surprise... \nI had to get a quick bang trim and was told that my appointment was at 7:15.. didn't get seated until 7:45.. just so that she can mess up my bangs.I was charged $20 dollars for a bang and a couple of layers. I am not an expert on cutting hair but the girl that used to trim my bangs back home did not have the same techniques as she did. I wasn't mad since it was my fault anyways that I didn't book elsewhere. Needless to say, I will never go back.
2 ||| We didn't wait at all to be seated, and our host was very friendly and nice.  Our waiter however could have cared less about us.  Our food was luke warm. I the carne asada taco that left a bad taste in my mouth and the rice that came with black beans reminded bland Uncle Ben's rice.
4 ||| C&G was recommended to me by some family friends. I have an engagement ring that has been in my family for almost 150 years and I wanted to keep the tradition alive by giving the ring to my fiance. I visited two other jewelers who both told me that they could not size the ring up, that it had an irreparable crack in the setting and that I would be best suited to scrap the ring, and use the stone in another setting. I went to C & G with the notion that I was going to have to do just that. However, C & G told me that was not the case at all and in four days had restored the ring and it looks like it is brand new. I can not thank them enough and would urge anyone reading Yelp to ignore the two bad reviews found here. I would strongly urge anyone in Central Phoenix who needs a good, high quality, highly skilled jeweler to seek out C & G!!!!
4 ||| I've eaten here numerous times.  It's a favorite of our children.  The wait staff is a bit iffy sometimes, but the food has always been consistent.  They have the cutest gift shop and their prices are great!
3 ||| Our team from work came here for lunch.  It is my first time!  After all these years, I finally made it inside for some food.  I selected off the lunch menu (quite a selection for lunch).  I ordered the Poco Pollo Con Queso.  It is a golden brown chicken chimichanga topped with two kinds of cheese.  It comes with rice and I got black beans.  YUM!  It was really good.  The refills are drinks were fast and you did not have to ask.  The only weird thing was they took our bowl for the chips away.  I thought they were refilling it, it never made it back to our table.  \n\nI agree with Jacob L. the deco was WAY over the top.  Almost touristy.
4 ||| Had a great lunch here with my grandparents. I would give 5 stars for our server personally, he was amazing, totally played along with my grandfather's sarcasm, and was quick with refills etc (if you go in, he is the tallest one, today he was repping an AZ Cardinals shirt). I had the French Dip, so did my grandma, and my gramps had fish & chips. \n\nNow for the cons, first off the hostess could care less about seating us, it seemed like it would absolutely kill her to smile, when she wasn't smacking the waiters with menus and calling them \"whores\" loud enough that my 80 year old grandparents could hear (they are super old fashioned, I kept praying they wouldn't hear her). Then there was the random server who very awkwardly came to our table, interrupted our lunch to let me know that \"I looked SO familiar, he must know me etc\" and went on and on, in essence hitting on me in front of my grandparents. so awkward. Thankfully, our waiter came over a few times and jokingly tried to let him know it was time to go, but the guy didn't get the hint. That waiter continued to stare and make me uncomfortable until we walked out the door after lunch. Also, my gramps mentioned that the fish and chips were more bread than fish, though they had great taste.\n\nOVERALL, we had a good lunch with our server, who deserves kudos for being so on the ball and taking great care of us, but the cons have kind of creeped me out.
3 ||| Located on the SE corner of the Kyrene and Rural intersection, in the main strip mall building, behind the Walgreen's.  At this time, the parking lot has been torn up, so be careful driving through there.\n\nI don't have a lot of dry cleaning done, but I've had a number of things done here at what I consider reasonable prices.  I've had things dry cleaned, a pair of pants taken in at the waist in the back, and my wedding dress dry cleaned here.  I had no problems - they all came out as expected.\n\nOne time, I got a beet stain in a turquoise skirt.  They couldn't promise it would come out, but it did come out to where I can't see it.  I guess I got it in there fast enough, too!\n\nI'm only giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't feel like they do anything particularly special.  It's more like 4.5 stars.  I've never gone price-shopping for dry cleaning - they are the closest place to my house.  It sounds like they are more expensive Avalon Cleaners.\n\nI wish they would let me return their hangers.  I haven't suggested that or tried to give them back, but they don't ask.
1 ||| I just don't understand how this isn't a rip off of Potbellys (of course it could be that Potbellys ripped off them). Traffic Jam = A Wreck. Same thing. Even the hot peppers same thing.\n\nAlso, the bread disappointed me. It was dry, cracky, and cut the inside of my mouth (don't you hate when bread does that and leaves the top of your mouth raw?).
3 ||| Finding authentic Pakistani food was almost impossible despite a large community and so called Pakistani restaurant called copper kettle. This restaurant serves chicken karahi which is actually tasty. The nans are freshly baked and are a delight. The restaurant itself is about the size of walk in closet and can only seat eight people. I would only recommend it for take out food. The owner is very courteous.
3 ||| Really fun.  I always take people from out of town there.  Always good after the river too.  \n\nSometimes the hostess gives me a hard time about reservations for the Teppan Yaki, but it's worth it...
4 ||| Ordered chicken noodle soup on a cold day just like mama use to make. Then followed up with a half beef brisket sandwich on rye, meat was lean and seasoned to perfection. \nThis place I'd always busy and locals know this secret spot in green valley.\nDefinately worth going for that new York busy deli feel.
0 ||| I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class, snotty, unhelpful useless piece of trash!!  Stay away from this store at all cost!!!!
4 ||| My husband and I decided to try a new place for lunch and we are glad we chose this place. We started with the slow roasted beef sliders. The horseradish cream on the sliders was subtle, which I can appreciate. The corn cakes were delicious and very filling. The fish tacos were ok, lacked a little bit of seasoning. We shared the grilled beef tenderloin with mushrooms. The portions were great! I love a restaurant that has hardy dinner dishes for lunch. I'm not stuck ordering a salad, sandwich or burger! We will be back!
0 ||| Absolutely terrible, and dangerous!!  Manicurist cut my cuticle and then cut Herself somehow. Didn't see a thing wrong with it. No apology. She didn't put on a glove!! She simply said \"it happens\". Unbelievable! I do not want a bloodborne disease from a salon and if you don't either stay far far away from this place. She was so casual about it!! Also, I left with polish all over my skin and a French manicure that would have been dine better at a $10 Korean nail salon.
3 ||| Average small-town diner feel in all the good and bad ways. Food tastes pre-cooked or frozen, meny is too large, service is great, and it's breakfast all day.
0 ||| If I could have given today's experience negative stars, I would have.\n\nThe food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \"going to need a high chair for that?\" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\n\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\n\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\n\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\n\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\n\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\n\nI'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\n\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.
4 ||| I've been seen here for nearly 6 years as a patient and have no complaints. Susan and Dr Hetrick have been as helpful as is possible for my condition and are always concerned and ready to talk about new or existing issues and treatments. The office staff have been friendly and helpful
0 ||| I don't know why I continue to come to this gym.....it has continued it's downhill spiral.  Since my last review, which was ONLY 7 months ago......\n\n- One of the water fountains in the main workout room broke down, was removed, and hasn't been replaced......it's been gone for weeks now.\n\n- The sinks are still filthy and moldy.\n\n- The Men's locker room is a disaster every day......dirty towels everywhere.  The dirty towel container is always full and overflowing.\n\n- The showers in the Men's locker room are always so disgusting that I've stopped taking showers there.....I go back home to clean up.\n\nSo why am I still a member there?  I have a really great monthly rate ($36) and I hate crowded gyms.....the other two gyms near my home, one a 24 Hr Fitness & the other a Las Vegas Athletic Club, are always crowded and my monthly membership costs would go up.......so those are the only 2 reasons why I'm still a member here.\n\nWill I return?  I'm here 4 to 6 times per week.....highly probable.
3 ||| Stopped in tonight, a Sunday, right at closing to get some crickets for our new family gecko. Surprisingly, they invited us in for a $1 sale after closing time. It's service like that that will bring us back and keep us from the big chains!
0 ||| I used to love this place and would eat there often dealing with hour long waits.  My family loves the rocking chairs and checkers games to play while waiting.  Over the years I had noticed the quality of food was spotting with sometimes good, sometimes bad but we continued to go.  The last time we waited over an hour, the kids were tired and hungry and we were thrilled when we finally got a table.  Being they were so bust service was slow.  We waited forever for drinks and to place our order.  About 40 minutes later our food came.  My daughter was sitting next to me and my son was sitting next to my husband.  My husband has ordered a breakfast meals with everything.  He took a large piece of ham off his plate and gave it to my son.  My son took one bite and said it didn't taste good and he wasn't hungry.  Thinking he was just being difficult, I said he had to eat it.  I watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong.  My husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was BAD.  I mean really BAD like off color and smelled rotten.  I was in shock.  That could make someone really sick.  We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.  \nMy family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.  I am not sure how this could happen.  How does bad food get out of the kitchen?  How could no one notice?  I will never go back!
2 ||| The staff are efficient and friendly. They could use an upgrade to their chairs and tables, not the most comfortable setting. Nice place to meet someone for a quick chat. In the winter - the place can be a little too cold to sit and enjoy a leisurely lunch. I don't drink coffee,but the sandwiches and soup are a-1.
0 ||| what a dump!  it's a motel 6.  Marriott take your name off this cheap motel because it doesn't deserve the marriott brand.  You can hear everyone walking down the walkway because the walls are so thin plus the TV and shower next door.  The thin bedding and not even enough room to walk beside your bed makes this the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  The GM didn't want to discount my bill because I used social media to complain tipped me over the edge because it's my right to an opinion.  She told me they are first generation Marriott which means what?  I found out 4 years ago they did a remodel....wow, they need a tear down then!
4 ||| This week will be week 3 of course II. I'm having a great time and having fun in the class. Wilton has discontinued the current coursework and has released a new version on cake decorating standards.\n\nI try to keep my learnings public on my blog http://www.carmeloricarde.com/week2-of-course-ii/
3 ||| I've been to Cracker Barrel a few times before, and always enjoyed it. The food reminds me of stuff my mom, aunts, and grandmothers cook and the service is good.\n\nLast night I went with my girlfriend and our food came out really fast, which was great. But it was warm at best. My mashed potatoes were pretty much cold, with warm spots. My chicken n dumplings were mostly warm, with some cold spots. My fried apples were cold. The mac n cheese was slightly above room temperature. Her meat loaf sandwich was prepared different then usual, had no gravy, and the bread was soggy. We were both starving so we ate what was brought, and I had planned on just letting the manager know. I even took my leftovers in a box. I wasn't looking for any sort of discount or anything, since we had come in late on a Sunday night and the food tasted great besides the temperature.\n\nWhen I mentioned the issues to the manager, he immediately said they'd take care of our meal. I was shocked. I was actually offering to pay our bill, and he wouldn't let me.\n\nEveryone has off days, and the manager went above and beyond to correct an issue that I wasn't even really that concerned about. Last nights visit won't stop me from coming back.
0 ||| Be very careful when renting here. While I think we did get a fair price. They are very sneaky in the way they try and up sell you. We were told we could have an upgrade for $89. We thought that was great so agreed to it. Then they told me to just sign here and your good to go. Luckily I read the whole statement and my bill had gone from $209.00 to over $700.00! It was per day and they were not clear at all about that. They really try and find anywhere they can to gauge you. Read everything carefully!!!
4 ||| I have a confession to make and it won't be pretty... Ok, are you ready? Sigh... My name is Beth F. and I have a problem... but they say the first step to fixing that problem is to admit it right?? Well forget that, I don't want to help this problem!! I think I could literally drink Sonny's sweet bbq sauce. \nIt is so freaking amazing I think we could start a world peace movement with that sweet creamy deliciousness. I would say to give me a few buckets of it, to start the movement, but I think my will power would cave and I'd end up consuming it all before I could even get it to the places it needed to go. \nThe service at this location has always been fantastic and fast, and my God, it goes without saying that their bbq is the best I've ever had. My only complaint about Sonny's is that it's not walking distance to my house. We had one nearby that closed I guess, and so I'm just bummed and it's making me whiney. :P \nThey have a salad bar, but let's be honest... who eats the salad bar when the BBQ plates are so filling... NOM... If you're hungry NOW, and want something that you will most likely have leftovers from, this is your place.
0 ||| \"Could have bought it in a store\" Hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn.  Totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out.  No one gave us a bill and I had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money.  Didn't even get a \"thanks\" with my change.\n\nSo not worth the walk that we took to get here.
2 ||| Didn't seem to want to help me.. Pretty nice selection though, maybe they had something that would have worked. Oh well... there are other jewelers in town.
0 ||| My BF and I had a particularly rough day & decided to skip cooking at home and went to Four Peaks around happy hour time last week. I was looking forward to some good food and a couple of glasses of wine. It will be the last time we ever go there.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes for anyone to even come over and greet us & take our drink order and even then, we had to go to the hostess stand and pick up our own menus. We decided to split the steak fajitas. We were pleasantly surprised when the food came out quickly. Then I took a couple of bites and realized that the fajitas were so incredibly spicy that I would be unable to eat them. The menu did not describe them as spicy and since Four Peaks is NOT a Mexican restaurant, I would never expect that level of spice. I eat some fairly spicy foods, but this was so spicy that they need to say so on the menu! We could not find our waitress, so we told the hostess about the issue. She just looked at us & said, \"oh..sorry!\" but did nothing, just kept leaning on the hostess stand. Even BF had to stop eating the fajitas - he was sweating bullets!! When the waitress came by over 10 minutes later, she apologized and then said she'd be right back. I thought she was going to get a manager, but no..she just went to deliver drinks to another table. ?? When she came back and asked if I'd like something else. I ordered the calamari appetizer. When it came, I was again disappointed with the menu's description. It wasn't the usual calamari, it was the large, thick, chewy variety instead of the small, crispy & light type. Again, they should put this in the menu description!\n\nI sat with an empty wine glass for 15 minutes and when we got our bill, they had made no concession for the mishap with the fajitas. Our bill was over $50 and I went home hungry. The service was terrible and so was the food.
0 ||| I've been here several times and the pizza is always very good.  But...since the new Galaxy Luxury plus theater has opened and they've started to get really busy the service has fallen off a cliff.  On our last trip it took about one hour for our pizza to arrive and our drinks never got refilled even once...very upsetting to say the least.  Maybe they're in the process of staffing up, because if not, they're going to need to staff down...all the way down, if you know what I mean ;-).
0 ||| I like that I can get an iced coffee and get my own refills. I also really like the sun dried tomato schmear. Beyond that, I kind of hate this place. It's always small and crowded, often having to weave around people constantly to get my order, go to the table, wait in line to get creamer, etc. It's just annoying how crowded this place is. They also seem to not be capable of keeping some types of bagels in stock, even on busy weekends. Then, you have the poor attitude of the rude kids behind the counter. It's just frustrating coming here, so we avoid it and choose other less mainstream joints.
4 ||| I ordered the Loaded Fries! I also tried te Mahi Tacos , let me tell you the Loaded Fries are Phenomenal!!!! So if you happen to show up and are undecided , then try the loaded fries! You will not regret it!! The place is neat giving the fact that it's a busy place the place is well maintained. The staff is friendly and they are good at what they do. A huge plus of eating here is the great view o the river and the city .
3 ||| This place is way overpriced, as far as the steakenburger part goes.  Bread's meh, the philly steak is meh, all in all - meh...  But very overpriced.  Think 8 bucks for a steakenburger (burger with philly meat as well) fries and drink.
3 ||| Went to this place for breakfast for lunch with my sister. It was fast friendly service and they were quick to refill my sweet tea and awkward requests (I mix and match slides). \n\nMy sister ordered pancakes which she had no problem with and returning to the South, the bowl of grits were delightful.
1 ||| My husband and I had dinner there after reading that the restaurant was on Diner Dirive Ins and Dives. Disappointed with our meal. Hubby got the carne asadas  that really looked like chopped beef and had no flavor, I had a chicken enchilada that was stuffed very well with chicken, but the presentation was so bland looking on the paper plate and flavor not there .Chips had little flavor and the salsa-well we won't discuss that.\n\nOnce we received our food, we asked for water and had to ask twice. The margaritas were good, but nothing to write home about. It was a Saturday evening and they were somewhat busy. It appears the locals do patronize the business , which is a good thing. \n\nK&J\nPhoenix
1 ||| First things first....don't take your kids here late at night looking for some rustic Italian pizza experience...its a pretty rough & tumble locale. Aside from that...I thought the pizza here was very good. I travel a lot to NJ/CT/NY and the pie isn't as good as some of the more famous joints in that area...but hey...your in Pittsburgh and not New Haven. \nOrder the pie well done....tell them to basically burn it and that you won't complain and you will get a very, very nice pie. Plus...where else can you get a 40 while you wait for your pie? Bring change for the meter and the for the guy that needs 0.50 to get home.
4 ||| Ocha is strictly about what is on the plate- deliciousness! \n\nA quintessential example of \" A hole in the wall, with amazing food.\"\n\nThai Beef Jerky is a must!
2 ||| Soup, salads, baked potato & more.  Fair price.  Fairly clean place.  Lot of riff-raff here, but it is a buffet and they seem to be a riff-raff magnet I suppose.  I thought the skew towards healthier options would be a deterrent but I guess not.  Maybe if I find one of these in a more upscale zip code the ambiance will be better, because it is hard to use the same tongs as some of the folks you see in here!  \n\nSnobbery aside, the food is rather average, but the convenience & variety are certainly a plus.
4 ||| So yes I went back.  And YUM!  The chips and salsa are really my fave.  It didn't seem so chaotic as my last visit and my waiter was so accomodating.  I had a cheese crisp with beans, black olives, and onions and it really satisfied  my craving.  Can't wait to go back for more...  And the iced tea is fresh!
2 ||| Went Friday afternoon to get the pie I had heard was so good. I got a little leary when I noticed the crust didn't look fresh baked (all the same like frozen). I saw pies on a baking rack and felt reassured they were baked at the restaurant. Waited by the bakery case for some time till we decided to get in the checkout line since no one noticed us.   Plenty passed by. No smiles anywhere. \n\nFoodies this pie is not for you. I got the mixed berry crumb. The crust was more crumy than flakey. The filling tasted over sweet, over gellatenous. The crumb topping was tasteless not buttery as it should.\n\nOverall it was not horrible; just not great. I'd say just below frozen Marie Callendars. If you are expecting hand crafted made with love pie drive on to downtown Phoenix and visit Lolas.
3 ||| I think enough has been said about Cherry Blossom so I'm going use this review to pledge my love for Zaru Soba.\nWhen I was 18 I spent nearly a month in Japan in the Sister City exchange program. It was during the summer and my host mother would always make cold noodles with dipping sauce, a very popular dish during the humid summer months. I nearly fell out of my chair when I first tried the Zaru Soba at Cherry Blossom, I was instantly transported back to my incredible time in Japan. \nCold buckwheat noodles, a light soy-based dipping sauce and a little fried panko fish on the side, the perfect dish for when it's hot as sin outside. A little banana bread to start doesn't hurt either!\nSay what you will about the service, I often only go at lunchtime when there aren't that many people but I have found the service to be unintrusive and very polite. \nNow if only I could find a place in Phoenix that serves Japanese pancakes....
1 ||| Since we just moved and have no internet, yet, my boyfriend and I were looking for a place he could do some homework and I could check my email. Based on the reviews, we decided to try here. The coffee was good, the vault study room was nice, but someone came in and started pounding on the piano at top volume just after we arrived. It was so loud, the group playing a game at the table next to it had to shout to hear each other and my boyfriend couldn't hear the videos he had to watch for class with earphones.
2 ||| First off... their Horchata is phenomenal - and would be the only reason I'd probably step foot back into Robertos.  Also, I was told that the margarita was fairly decent.  Other than that... everything else that we had was pretty \"meh\".  My mom was in town, and craving Mexican, so we decided to try Roberto's out from the Yelp reviews - I kind of wish we wouldn't have.  For starters, we were told we'd be brought chips and salsa... but they never came.  We waited a good 45 minutes to get any food, which seems crazy to me to make people wait for 45 minutes for some food served on disposable plates with plastic silverware in an environment that looks like there are serving up fast food.  And then to make people wait that long and not even bring them chips and salsa.  Not great on the service standpoint.  As far as the food goes, my husband ordered the Al Pastor burrito - he said it was bland and greasy, definitely not anything close to what he is used to (and he said that the Al Pastor could have benefited greatly from some pineapple, which I believe it is traditionally served with).  My dad ordered the rellano combo plate, which he said was good, but definitely not the best he has ever had... maybe typical middle road.  My mom ordered the enchilada and taco combo - she didn't like the enchilada at all and only ate some of the chicken out of the inside of the taco - definitely didn't satisfy her mexican food craving.  I ordered the chicken chimi combo, which was really bland and typical - nothing special or that I'd want to eat again.  We all discussed that the beans were pretty good, but that does not a meal make.  So to have to wait that long and then be completely underwhelmed by bland mexican food... not likely that we'll be returning, unless of course in the area and craving some horchata.
0 ||| How do you rate a place that has been so bad for so long.  High prices for mediocre pizza and long wait times to boot.  They just raised their already high prices even higher.  Lack of any care at all from the people taking the order to making you wait \"cause its coming right up\" for more than 20 additional minutes as they find your order and make it in front of you.  Nope...never again.
4 ||| You have to love this Charlotte classic. Way laid back, killer patio. Cold beers and a casual place to chill all day.
0 ||| Slow service and the people serving food don't seen to be in a hurry at all to help the customers. I guess bad management.
4 ||| I'm visiting Mesa from Denver and I'm burning up. Craving cold ice tea I came to Walgreens.  Bought it. And left feeling accomplished
0 ||| I drove to Joe's after seeing the \"Southern Fried Maine Lobster\" commercial and now wished I would have stayed home and made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  What you see in the commercial [lots of lightly breaded lobster] is absolutely not what you get......Sure, if you enjoy dragging a mound of overly seasoned breading through equally over-seasoned butter, then go nuts!  But if you are looking for lobster, you'll need to go \"Indiana Jones\" on your plate of food...... and if you're really lucky, you'll find lobster...............but only the tips of the lobster claws and a few random claw knuckles.  I 'dug' through two plates [I sent the 1st one back] and after an exhaustive effort, came up with maybe 3 ounces of actual lobster surrounded by over a pound of breading.  The mac & cheese was good, as was the corn, but you will not find a more cut-and-dried case of  bait and switch anywhere [pun intended].  So if you are looking for lobster......look somewhere else.
3 ||| Overall a very good Chinese restaurant.  The Orange chicken, Beef broccoli and Triple delight a very good.  The Teriyaki chicken was just ok and the egg roll was good, but not great. Very reasonably priced very good food.
3 ||| Bealls is a bit of a hit or miss!  But it is fun to look around and you can sometimes find some great deals.
2 ||| The gym is fairly clean, however it is pretty small and they didn't really have a large range of exercise equipment plus they only had one mat to stretch out on.
1 ||| We were hitting some DDD joints in Phoenix on our trip from LA, and hit this place on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nIt was, uh, OK, I guess.  I had the chimichanga chicken burrito, my wife had two chicken tacos, and the kids had other stuff.  There was some serious greasiness going on here - the food was good, but absolutely nothing to write home about.\n\nBy the way, the counter lady was a serious crab - no smiles, she seemed to be just putting in time.\n\nOther than the kitsch factor of it being in a gas station, I can't fathom why DDD would have gone here....
0 ||| I'm not entirely sure how anyone eats here once they've been inside.  A dirty restaurant is one of the best ways for me to get on my 'list'.\n\nYeah, this place is on that list.\n\nAs a non-native first year med student I just didn't have a lot of time or options so, silly me, I would go here thinking \"maybe the last time was just an off day\".  There were times I'd walk over and over half the tables there had food remains all over them.  Often times there was trash waiting there too.  Well, after a month or so of their off days with terrible, greasy, and just wholly unappetizing food, I decided to finally take a little extra time to bring or travel further for food.\n\nI'm sure it's the healthier option anyway.  For a number of reasons.  I don't think, no matter how busy it gets, that I'll be stopping in there this year.
4 ||| Amazing! Perfect! Definitely coming back and adding this to my list of favorite places! The Ceaser salad was so unique and amazing. Homemade Ceaser dressing. Hummus had so much delicious garlic, pita bread was outstanding. Loved the homemade baklavah. Mint tea was so good.
2 ||| If I could give a nostar rating for my very first experience here I would. I decided to try them out since everyone gave them a great review and they are doing the 4 garments & 1 comforter for free deal. Well upon my arrival I mentioned  the \"Yelp\" deal and they said that only applied to the Tempe location?!! I wonder f you go to Tempe, they tell you it only applies to the Scottsdale location. Not impressed on first contact. I walked out.
1 ||| I used Galardi's for ~ 4 months when I first moved to Pittsburgh. I've since changed cleaners. I think Galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area. The owner is actually a nice lady; but, after nearly having 3 shirts ruined I decided enough was enough. \n\nI think their delivery guy is a huge part of the problem, I actually like the owner, but I can't keep having my clothes messed up and not have anyone take responsibility for it. I wish I could tell people to go here but I can't do it in good conscience.
4 ||| Its what you would expect. Old world charm with new cuisine. Always elegant and great service a new york classic! I usually frequent more trendy dining establishment but visit the historic sites are just as good.
2 ||| Went there with a group of about 8 people.  I ordered a 'big' margarita...which actually wasn't bad.  The food on the menu looked good, but I was not a fan of the chips and salsa.  I know most people rave about it...but the whole squeeze bottle salsa was actually too thin for me.  I like my salsa chunky so that I can dig in with my chips.  Anyways, I ordered the my food and was happy with it.  It was very good.  Probably worth 4 stars in my book, but since I only gave this restaurant 3 stars your probably wondering why only 3 of you just said it's worth 4 stars.  Well the reason I knocked it down was because of the service.  Just not very good at all.  Our service seemed irritated everytime we asked for anything.  She only came to check on us 1 time during the whole meal.  We had to get up ourselves and go to the kitchen to get a side of sour cream and our own napkins.  I'll try them again to see if maybe she was just the bad apple of the bunch.
0 ||| Tried this place several times on the chance the first time I went they were just having an off night? I was wrong..The bartender and the server were rude...and the prices sky high..both times left me with a bad taste in my mouth..enough said..don't waste your time
4 ||| I grew up on this stuff... and now that I live in New England, Macayo's is one of the first stops I make when returning home to Las Vegas. My family keeps those ridiculous gigantic margarita glasses at my Grandmother's house, just so they can have one more (this could set me off on a tirade about how margaritas, and mexican food in general should be simple and cheap... but if you are reading this in Las Vegas, you already know that). \n\nThe chimichangas are amazing, the chili rellenos are outstanding... really, I think by now I have had everything on the menu, and I long for it from the other side of the country. \n\nEat in good health, and have a bite for me!
4 ||| This is one of the two major theaters we frequent (the other being the Harkins on Shea)... It goes beyond the typical multi-plex, and the staff is always friendly, and the management seems to have a firm grasp on staffing requirements, which keeps the lines down.
4 ||| Love this place! Margaritas are delicious, and the servers are always friendly and accomodating. I also enjoy that they recently added more seafood dishes to their menu. Chicken spinach enchiladas and nachos are among my favorites. Glad to have this restaurant in my neighborhood!
0 ||| If there was a zero star option I would choose it!  They messed up tacos, how can a Mexican place mess up tacos???\n The service was very slow and snarky. I don't think I would come back here again!!!
3 ||| One of the things that always strikes me about Japanese restaurants is how \"americanized\" they tend to be. This is not so at Ichiza, which is probably my favourite place to eat in Las Vegas.  It's an izakaya so forget the menu and order off the wall. That's where all the good stuff is anyway including the \"Eel Kaarage tempura roll\" (or as I like to call it: the best thing that I have eaten in my entire life). You won't find any \"all you can eat\" sushi here but if you're looking for good, authentic Japanese fare, this is definitely the place to go. \n\nOnly con: Be prepared to wait for a long time to get in, especially if you're going during meal times. It's worth it though.
0 ||| I came to get a quick dinner with a friend and catch up. I have been to Carrabba's (Savannah, GA) once before, but I don't remember it being this terrible. \n\nThe service was your standard big box restaurants...not much to write home about. What got me was the actual food, it was too salt to eat... The spinach sauteed in olive oil was too salt to eat! The night's special, Chicken Sorrentino was somewhat hard to eat. It was roasted chicken with what seemed to be microwave heated prosciutto (!!!) with American cheese melted on top...it was unappetizing to say the least. I was really trying to look at the good of this dish, but it was a no go...\n\nI will never eat here again.
4 ||| So I basically set up a Yelp account just so I could rate this salon. I called in and got an appointment with Samantha. I was pleased to see that she has great reviews, as I was cutting my shoulder length hair completely off and needed someone who knew what they were doing.\nI've never had my hair cut this short before, I wanted a Rihanna-type hair style, short on the sides, long in front.  My hair came out perfect! Samantha cut it better than I imagined, and I couldn't be more pleased! I definitely recommend her, and I will definitely be back.
2 ||| I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in, so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  It was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations.
4 ||| Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.
4 ||| I had an excellent ice cream soda and a great sandwich for lunch. The decor/seating was excellent. I felt like i went back in time just walking in. The food and staff were tops! Highly recommended!
4 ||| I have been taking my families vehicles to Honest One for well over 5 years. I have always been treated fairly with my pricing for all types of needs and different issues we have had.  I usually will always get a second opinion and pricing, yet I always find myself back with Mark because I trust him and they always seem to find the true solutions for the best price.  Their personal customer service is a breath of fresh  air in comparison to shops I had used previously. I was recommended to use Honest 1 by a friend years ago, and I feel compelled to pass along the word to others.
4 ||| I'm really surprised when I read the reviews of the haters here. We live nearby and have been getting pizzas for years and have loved every one. Just had my favorite - the Classic Combo. Are the haters other pizza joints?
4 ||| I love coming here because it's right on campus and I can pop in for a haircut in between class or when I have a break.  \nI never get very complicated haircuts, but I am very particular about how my layers and side-swept bangs are cut.  I ALWAYS go to Jayna; she is an absolute pro when it comes to layering - and does a great job blending etc.  She also has a great eye for what styles will look good on you, so if you are indecisive or don't really know what you want, you can trust her opinion.  The prices are great and all the stylists are incredibly nice and friendly.  \nOnce I also tried coloring my own hair, which ended in disaster!  I called them up and they fixed it right away.  I've never had a bad experience there!
3 ||| If you are driving through Florence you must stop in and grab a bite to eat. Large outside patio with smoking and a great view.
4 ||| This is my favorite sushi place. I always leave feeling like I had a great time and looking forward to coming back. Recently had the Lobster Miso soup which had a huge lobster claw in it and looked very impressive which was fun for my daughter. IT gets pretty busy and is not a huge place so I recommend calling ahead.
4 ||| I very much second Lee Ann's experience. Being from NY it was very difficult to find anything here in the south I could even call \"Chinese food'. \nThan I stumbled across Hong Kong, not much to look at outside or in, but don't let that fool you. Very solid basic dishes.\n\nJust be careful to see who is cooking. One time out of many that I have been here the girl who normally takes the orders ending up cooking my food and boy could I tell the difference. It was terrible compared to previous visits but still on par with most Charlotte Chinese.
4 ||| Had a wonderful experience here recently on vacation in Scottsdale. Service was fast and attentive. Manager came by on more than one occasion just to make sure we were enjoying our time there; we were. Food was good, with solid Happy Hour options, including $1.50 (big) slices of pizza. My girlfriend had the Southwest salad, and couldn't have enjoyed it more. If we find ourselves out in AZ again in the future, it's likely we'll be making a return trip to Zipps.
2 ||| The Gyro house was a back-up plan after Wahsun Chinese was closed AGAIN on a random night.  The place is tiny but the prices and quality of food made up for the sub-par interior. \nI got the Gyro plate and my man went with the Souvlaki, both came with rice, a pita and a small salad for under $10 bucks. The tzatziki sauce was delicious. \n\nI don't think I would ever dine in, but this is a great spot to pick up Greek when you are too lazy to cook.
2 ||| Best doughnuts in Pittsburgh. \n\nI generally pass on other baked goods. Mediocre bread.\n\nGenerally unfriendly staff, but Walnut St. attracts pretty arrogant customers - so it makes sense.
0 ||| They are crooks & bamboozled me for a meal that I did not even enjoy! Beware of their pricing and I will never eat there again!
0 ||| Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice, never my choice, I had tummy ache both times. I think the food is boring. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with non-gourmet food, but Ritter's, is just \"blah\". It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around. \nThey are cash only also. That doesn't both me at Pamelas, because the food is oh so delish. Here, you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement.
4 ||| I wasn't impressed. Especially if you compare it to Popeyes. Nothing compares to Popeyes. I tried their gizzards, hush puppies and tots. Eh. I guess if you're in the area craving fried chicken this is the spot. Cash only.
4 ||| I agree with most of the group.  A hidden gem here in Charlotte.  As you sit in the restaurant and watch the horse and carriage go by, you feel like you're in some other city.\nGreat atmosphere and food.\nThis was me and my husband's first date...per my suggestion(he was new to town).
2 ||| I have no idea why one day I was craving the steak here.  I went to another branch once back when I lived in California.  It was packed for a Monday night.. mostly snow birds.  We got tilapia, sirlon steak special, and a rib eye steak. Took the waitress a wihle to take our order, she brought us over bread that was super fresh and hot, very yummy.  Tilapia was a lot better than I expected, seemed like it would be overwhelming if i ate the whole thing though.  My friend said the sirlon was good.  As for my rib eye steak I ordered medium rare but it was well done.  I felt bad to bother them at such a busy time but I couldnt eat the well done steak it was way too dry.  They were nice and made me a new steak but it took forever.. both my boyfriend and roommate were done with their food when my new steak came out. The new one was juicier but didnt have much flavor.  Not a big fan of chain resturants.. they always cook my steak too much, just my luck I guess.  Will not be returning.
0 ||| This place is beautiful. The food is okay but very expensive. The reason for one star is that one of our party became violently ill after dining there. We believe it could be food poisoning related to the walleye. When I called to report this to management I did not get an empathetic response. The message I got was essentially \"not our fault\". No caring whatsoever. In looking at other postings I saw other reports of possible food poisoning. While we do not know if our food poisoning was related to the restaurant be forewarned that you will not get a sympathetic ear if you report it.
0 ||| This was a sadness pile on a failure plate.   I have had worse but never in a place so widely considered a treasure by the Yelping community.  From recent reviews it looks like this place is a shell of its former glory and that's sad, because the potential is there. From my experience tonight, the rumors may be true.
2 ||| Rather pricey. 1 round of drinks and 3 sushi rolls came to over $70 before tax/tip for only two people. Service was just okay. Happy hour ends early, at 5:00 PM.
2 ||| This place is strange. There really isn't any other way to describe it... It's like a tiny little store (that only sells strange Norwegian candies and cookies) with a deli attached to it. It has folding tables in the center of it that are connected to one another so you can make a new friend at lunch (I guess), or have the staff stare at you while you eat (they didn't do that, but it still feels odd to eat there). The whole place is very small, and the deli area is wallpapered with sloppy white sheets of paper advertising different lunch options.\n\nLet it be known, the food was very good. BUT, the place looks kind of dirty, and desperately needs someone to come in and make sense of it. The only issue that I took with the food was that they microwaved my hot sub. It was good, but I feel like microwaves belong at home. Just my opinion.
2 ||| Had the California burrito here. It was a burrito with French fries inside that was unique. Nothing outstanding but nice to mix it up if your tired of the average burrito.
1 ||| I took my son and daughter-in-law to breakfast today (I had a coupon from restaurant.com).    When this location first opened the food was fantastic and there would always be people waiting to get in.   The food has clearly gone downhill.  Each of the orders included pancakes.   The syrup was so thin it was like pouring water. We requested replacement of the syrup to a thicker one.   Our waitress brought replacement syrup.   It too was runny.   Clearly it was watered down.  This restaurant is obviously cutting corners.    There were only a few people in the restaurant even though it was prime breakfast time.   The other disappointment was we had a restaurant.com coupon and when we tried to use it we were told that they did not renew their agreement with restaurant.com.   I explained that the coupons do not expire.   I was told they would not accept it.   Called restaurant.com when I got home and they said restaurants have to accept them even if they do not renew contract.  Restaurant.com issued a $25.00 credit and said they would file a complaint against this Original Pancake House.   I gave the rating 2 stars since our waitress was extremely helpful.
4 ||| This is a friendly bustling neighborhood-type place which I love.  The three stars only are for having fish on the menu that isn't up to the standards of their beef dishes and apps. Sea bass smothered in a sweet and sour sauce with chiles, not very fresh and overcooked --uggh.  However, I did croon over my neighbor's beef dish. The crab mini-tosadas are really good. And the vegetable side dishes-all of them, including brocolini, brussel sprouts, potato in a pot, and asparagus--are commendable.  Great atmosphere!! Have fun.
0 ||| I had the worst nightmare ever!  I book 6 continues flight in my 1 week vacation with us \n\nairway, i took 1st flight and my luggage was lost and delayed. and the 2nd flight is late \n\nfor 2 hour ! and then i decide to drive to my destination . after i arrive at 3rd flight. \n\ntheyh told me simply because i skip a flight. they cancel all of our flight without any \n\nrefund or replacement. they told me unless i drive back to my 2nd destination and wait for \n\nanother day to catch the next flight to start over again . it sounds just really really \n\ncrazy and does not make any sense . i try to call talk to a manager after a manager they \n\ninsist i pay a 1000 dollar penatly . which is price for all 6 flight. they cancel all my \n\nflight and lie to me on the customer service phone. I sit at airport and they \n\nwont' let us go on our flight . they wont refund anything or let us get on any flight. we \n\nhave to sit at the aiport and use our laptop to get ticket with another airline to move on \n\nfor our trip and after we have to spent even more for buy so many other last minute flight \n\nticket to go to our other destination and go home. it is very sad and i dont' know how can \n\na airline have such awful mean disrespect and tricky service. trust me. they sold all of \n\nour seat to other ppl.  cuz we check later those flight are all full. i will not recoomend \n\nanyone try this airline unless u want to ruin ur trip.
0 ||| Are... you.... kidding?   Folks, this is why I started Yelping.  To bring truth to the masses - to expose restaurants for what they really are.  I'm in Las Vegas for Halloween and I wanted some good sushi.  So I searched on Yelp.com for \"sushi\" in Las Vegas.  I filtered the results by \"Highest Rated\" and guess what showed up?   Ichiza.   Sighhhhhhh  This is proof that you can't always trust what 123 reviewers think about a place.  \n\nFor those of you familiar with my reviews, you should know how big of a sushi snob I am.  You should also know how much I appreciate stumbling across \"hole in the wall\" sushi joints.  I love finding a diamond in the rough.  Ichiza, however, is not one.   Not even close.  For starters, let's talk about the menu.  Why do they have a menu?  I looked over this menu and there were THREE sushi rolls.  ONLY THREE?  How can you only have three sushi rolls???  One of them was a California Roll, which doesn't count.  The other was a tempura roll, which also is not real sushi.   The third was the Spider Roll, fried soft shell crab in a roll.   I asked the waitress if they had another menu for sushi - surely, this can't be it.  She explained, the rest of the menu is on the walls.  What?  You mean all those random pieces of paper taped to the walls of the restaurant?  That's the full menu?  So... do you want me to get up and walk around the entire restaurant and try to find and memorize what i want to eat?  This is EFFING RIDICULOUS!  So after I browsed the \"menu wall\", I found two other rolls.  One was called the Natto Roll, which was soybean and okra in a roll that's deep fried and topped with tuna.   The other was called the Eel-Kara-age Roll, which has baked eel and fried chicken in a roll.   God help me, this was the worst crap I've eaten in so long.  The Natto Roll was FUNKY.  I love okra and I love soybeans, but mix the two together and add spongy rice and deep-fry it and suddenly it's disgusting.   The Eel-Kara-age didn't taste as bad, but was poorly created.  It's just rice stacked with a piece of fried chicken and a piece of eel on top.  That's it.  Sigh.   The Spider Roll, the only roll that I recognized from other sushi places, was not made like any Spider Roll I've ever had.  Yeah, they deep-fried the soft shell crab, but what's up with rolling it up with lettuce, carrots and cucumber?  LETTUCE, CARROTS and CUCUMBER???  In a sushi roll???? WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?  IS THIS A SICK AND TWISTED HALLOWEEN PRANK??  My friends were wiser than I was and decided to order the ramen instead.  They thought it was awful.  Noodles were not cooked enough and were hard. The broth was not good, either.  I've posted a picture of them - check it out.\n\nOk, enough about the baffling menu and utterly worthless food.  Lets talk service.  The waitress was quick enough coming over to take our order, but it took awhile because I had to run around the restaurant and tell her what I wanted.  Once she gave me my food though, she was hard to find.  I had to track another waitress down twice to get refills on my Diet Coke.  Btw, they don't have soft drinks on tap - only by the can and they charge you $5 per can.  Be warned.  \n\nIf you're staying on the Strip, like most people are, then this place is a little hard to get to unless you take a cab.  I would definitely not recommend walking to it.  It's also in a pretty ghetto part of town - be careful walking back at night.  Just take a cab both ways.   \n\nThe only REAL positive about this place?  I'm not sure how the waitresses dress during every other day of the year, but on Halloween they went all out.   There was a slutty bee, a slutty nurse, a slutty angel, and a slutty cabaret girl.  They were HOT.  If you're into hot asian chicks (I married one. Hot asian chicks ftw), then you'll find them working here.  Is it worth eating here though?  Sadly...... no.  Maybe you can come in right before closing and ask them if they wanna have a drink somewhere else.. far away.
0 ||| I'm still disappointed in this server. My friend ordered us some burgers and mine is always a cheese burger with mustard only. He came back to the table and we chit chatted for a bit and I looked at the receipt and it said a cheese burger with everything but mustard. I told my friend and he went back up to catch them before they made the burger and right away before he opened his mouth she said \"We are already cooking the burgers so you can't change your order\", he said ok I was just wanting to tell you that the burger is suppose to be a cheeseburger with mustard only and it's wrong on the ticket. This server had the nerve to tell him that he was lying and didn't tell her that. \n\nWow I couldn't believe it when he told me. If it were me she wouldn't have said it again that is for sure. What in the world has happened to customer care and satisfaction? It was such a simple thing that all she had to say was I'm sorry for the mix up and it will be no problem. I really don't think she should be waiting on customers.\n\nRudeness is not tolerated by this customer and they have lost 2 good customers.\n\nPS: I have her name but I don't think I need to mention that as I'm sure anyone that frequents there knows who I am talking about.
2 ||| My daughter ordered garlic parmesan boneless wings and received original tame. As this was a to go order she didn't go back to get this rectified.  Way too much money for the wrong stuff!
0 ||| Paper thin walls, yes, as other commenters have mentioned. Which, when the guy next door insists on watching porn all night? Not so much fun. \n\nThe service in the restaurant at breakfast was beyond awful. I have never had such a slow meal, and yet I went back for a second time. Both of my breakfast meetings were with different groups of people, and we all experienced severe slowness. \n\nIf you are there during the football season and the Steelers are playing at home, be prepared for a lobby full of drunk fans. \n\nFinally, please add more outlets! Having to unplug stuff/move furniture to charge my phone is a pain!
4 ||| We come to 300 East at least twice a month for their Sunday brunch - that would be at least every other weekend. Between the two of us, we get either two orders of the breakfast burrito (with chorizo) or one order of the breakfast burrito and whatever french toast special they are featuring that day. I love their focus on fresh, local produce. Everything just tastes very fresh and good. \n\nI've brought several out-of-towners here - for the food as well as for the atmosphere of the restaurant. As noted by several other reviewers, 300 East is located inside of a converted house. I think it really gives a feel for the Dilworth neighborhood.\n\nService has always been really great here. Depending on the weekend, you might need to make reservations, but if you can get in before 11am for brunch, you'll generally be ok just walking in.
0 ||| Very, very poor.  Oceans grill had little on the menu from the ocean, a selection similar to what you would find in a chain restaurant with a name that starts with \"Red\".  Add to that poor service, rude staff, poor presentation and astronomical prices and you have a recipe for disappointment.  I would steer clear of this place and buy a fish sandwich from Mickely D's if you need a seafood fix.
2 ||| We went here looking for a sofa one afternoon.  They have quite a selection, and a somewhat broad range of prices as well.  We walked around for a while, and several associates approached us, asking if we needed help. My tip: look disinterested whenever you see an associate, and they will leave you alone.  We tried out a few sofas, and eventually found one that was pretty cute for $300.  Price was our biggest deciding factor (as long as the sofa wasn't totally awful), and this one definitely fit the bill.\n\nWe signed up to have it delivered to the house, so we arranged a time for the following week.  Unfortunately, something went wrong when they processed the order (they had given us part of our order and somehow our entire order got changed to a walk-out), and we ended up waiting about 3 weeks total for the sofa.  They were pleasant enough about it, so I don't hold it against them, but just make sure to call them the day before the delivery to make sure it's all in place.\n\nOverall, we were pretty satisfied with our experience, and will consider going there for future furniture purchases.
0 ||| GROSS! \nI can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...\n\nwe took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! \nThe front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.\nI am going to post the pics
4 ||| I heard about the lounge on LinkedIn and checked it out with a friend and loved it.  I have been back around 20 times either by myself or with friends and have found it a great place to hang out an unwind after work.  I especially liked the 4U and the Michael Antoni and bought a box of each.
4 ||| This might be my new favorite date spot in charlotte. We went on a Wednesday night and as expected, we didn't need reservations. The decor was on point, dimly lit (dark enough to be inviting, and bright enough to read the menu). Our server was very knowledgeable and had wonderful suggestions for wines, appetizers, salads, cheeses and entrees. \nFor the appetizer, try the arrancini (breadcrumb coated risotto balls filled with mozzerella and panccetta and fried) and the scallops are apparently incredible.\n\nThe cheese selection is in my opinion the best part of the menu, but my beef tenderloin ala blue was the clear winner of the night. I want to go back again just writing this review! My date tried the Pork Milanese with Heirloom Tomatoes, which was very tasty, but very rich. It defintely won points for creativity, but not for eatability (if that makes sense). He ended up not being able to eat most of it, but luckly for him, I was able to share my steak and risotto
0 ||| Before you come here, lets get the most important thing out of the way.\n\nGET YOURSELF THE ROSETTA STONE KOREAN LANGUAGE LEARNING PROGRAM OR BRING SOMEONE THAT SPEAKS KOREAN!\n\nApparently, these guys are trying to be so authentic that they hired Korean staff that hardly speaks any english. I asked for a fork and dude says, \"You want spicy pork?\" I said yes because I love spicy pork but at the same time I really wanted a fork because I am chopstick challenged. I dont have any patience to use that crap.\n\nAnyways, I came here because of their grand opening special of AYCE bbq 12.95 for lunch and 15.95 for dinner. Add 5 dollars more if you want AYCE sushi with that. Come August 1st its going up to 20.95 for lunch and 25.95 for dinner. The 5 dollar sushi AYCE sushi option still applies.\n\nKeep in mind that you pick out what you want on the menu and they bring it out to you on plates. It's not like Sura where you get up and get whatever you want and bring it back to your table. \n\nWe ordered Short Ribs, Brisket, Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Chicken. The short ribs and Barbequed Steak (which they were out of) are only available for dinner. All that we ordered was really good except for the chicken which was kind of dry. \n\nBesides the language barrier as the first major disappointment, im sorry to say that there were more to add to it. One was the parking or should I say lack there of. The parking lot is small and the spaces are narrow. Dont be surprised if your car has a few more dings or dents when you come out to leave. I recommend parking on the street. Next, the grills they have you use are gold colored and are not designed properly. When cooking fatty foods like Pork Belly, there is no place for all the excess oil to drain except the sides of the grill where they can catch fire. Ours did and we had to turn off the fire so they can extinguish the flames. One of the bussers came up and sprayed some kind of all purpose cleaner to put the fire out but it caused it to flare up and almost burn our faces. Im glad I didnt get burned or there would have been a severe lawsuit pending. All they could say was, \"Oh, sorry\". From that point on, our server would come by and mop up any excess oil off the grill with napkins. Really? I dont ever recall any Korean Bbq joint doing this.\n\nI would also like to mention that they have these crystal grills that you can use as well. We were not offered this option and would have turned it down anyway because of my friends that tried it several days ago said it sucked.\n\nSome random info: Hours are 11 am to 12 midnight every day. Lunch is from 11 to 3 pm. Dinner is 3 pm to closing (12 midnight). Makes me wonder if you can sneak in right at 2:45 to get charged lunch price and get dinner items. If you try it and it works, let me know. Lol. Also, dont eat here if you are wearing nice clothes or are planning to go to a nice or formal event. The smoke from the barbeque stays in your hair and clothes. I made the mistake of eating at a Korean barbeque restaurant right before going to a graduation ceremony. Everybody was looking around wondering if somebody was barbequeing somewhere close by and ironically thats what people wanted to eat for dinner as soon as the event ended. \n\nSo in closing, I suggest that if you wanna try this place out, bad service and all, now would be the time because of the promo price. Then, you can decide if its worth any future trips when they charge regular price. For me that's a negative captain. \n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #162 \"Only YOU can prevent Korean barbeque grill fires\"
0 ||| awful pizza cheese sucks sauce sucks crust sucks disgusting bonless wings the worst i ve ever had hard and old...same with the fries ranch was runny and gross.. only thing ok was the coke lol anyways definitely wouldn't  ever eat there again anyone with any sort of standard for food and even pizza bc its kinda hard to mess up do not bother. pick up a frozen pizza it would be better :)
0 ||| I took 2 of my boys here for a daddy/son date. It was hideous. The mac and cheese looked old. My corned beef hash looked like it was right out of the can. The pancakes looked decent. The water tasted horribe. When I mentioned it they said it was because it was an old building. It is mass produced food you can make at home cheaper and better. I would suggest finding a better option.
0 ||| Fool me thrice, well, that's my fault but I've finally learned my lesson. \n\nIssue #1: I take a suit in to be dry cleaned because it smelled a little like a smoky bar and had some fur on it. I have a week's leeway before I need it. I go to get it when I'm told it will be ready and I'm told there's a delay because of excessive \"stainage\". Well, since there weren't any stains, I ask for a manager. At this point, the woman behind the counter says she needs to call me back. When she does call back, they admit to not knowing where it is. Eek! Ultimately they find it at whatever place they outsource it to and I was able to get it back later that day. Not a disaster, but should hav ebeen a red flag.\n\nIssue #2: a pair of jeans that I have hemmed end up 4\" too short. Well, I was pissed, but I didn't try them on for the tailor to measure and he just measured based on what I was wearing right then because I was in a hurry. I guess I thought that maybe it was possible that they could stretch in a different way or, I don't know, something. I took the blame for it and didn't make an issue.\n\nThe final issue: I paid for a pair of expensive pants to be hemmed and put a rush on them so they would be done by Thursday. I called on Thursday and they told me they'd be done on Saturday. Annoying, but nothing I could do. So, on Saturday I go in and the woman working says they can't find them... AGAIN. I wait for about 30 minutes while she makes a series of calls, to no avail, and then tells me she'll call me when they find them. Towards the end of the day they find them and I go to pick them up. They actually had the nerve to charge me. You'd think if you'd screwed a customer over this way, you might give them a freebie to make up for it. Not this place. When I said I'd never be back, the woman said \"we all make mistakes sometimes.\" To which, I replied, \"Not all of us make them as often as this place\".
4 ||| We were craving Chinese take-out and randomly found Qwik Chinese because it was close. We were very pleased with the discovery! The food was incredible and tasted much better than the name would imply :) This food is leaps and bounds beyond your typical take out. We got a few small entrees as well as fried rice, it was a ton of delicious food for the price.
3 ||| This is a great place for the view, the romantic ambiance, and the service.  The food, unfortunately, is hit-or-miss - especially considering the price.\n\nWe had a reservation at 9:30 on a busy night.  Fortunately, the dining rush was dying down by then and we were quickly seated by a corner table (tables on the northeast side will get you a better view of the Pittsburgh skyline).  The waiters were friendly and courteous, and the manager came out to deliver our wine selection.  True to the restaurant's name, the menu featured a copious selection of fish.  (I'm pretty sure that being at the top of a tall building on top of a hill overlooking a city is the opposite of being a grotto, though.)\n\nWe started with a sampler of various appetizers that included shrimp, crab cakes, and a fish skewer.  These all had great flavor and texture and paired well with their respective sauces.\n\nI had the whole bronzini classically prepared with tomatoes, onions, capers, and olives.  The kitchen delivered a solid performance on this one - crispy skin with tender flesh and a good balance of flavors.  I managed to sneak a few bites of my date's lemon sole, which was unfortunately overdone and in want of a sauce.  If you don't mind eating whole fish, that's what I would recommend - it's much harder to screw up the preparation.\n\nWe shared the chai tea cake for dessert, which was also perfectly acceptable.  There were many interesting choices available, though, and we had a hard time deciding.\n\nMoral of the story - this is a great place for a fancier date or night out, but don't expect amazing food.  Oh, and the wine list is fairly extensive and expensive, even by fancy restaurant mark-up standards.
0 ||| This place was gross and depressing.  We live nearby, but I will avoid ever going back.  We went to Taco Tuesday and were greeted with horrible service and even worse food.  I did not come here expecting anything nice or classy, so even with low expectations I left feeling slightly down and depressed from this sad place.
1 ||| I've decided to try this place since I've been going to Arai Pastry in Tempe for a while and wanted to try something new.  There were many selections but honestly, I'm gonna stick with Arai Pastry from now on...here is why:\n\n*First of all, this is not a Japanese bakery - I'm making this clear because even though there are similarities, Japanese and Chinese baked goods are most of the time, different.  \n\n*Less than so so decor - It is understood that the decor of the store has nothing to do with the quality of the baked goods.  However,  since I already know a place that is much cleaner, cuter and with polite service, I can't help but to see it as a negative.\n\n*So so service - There were no labels on each pastry trays so I asked the store lady to tell me what was inside some of them.  All I saw was annoyance from her....maybe she was just in bad mood....I have no idea.\n\n*I tried the following:\n-French horn - if you want a good one, please try the one at Lee's Sandwich\n-Custard cream bread - honestly, after a bite, we had to through it away...if you like custard cream bread, try the one at Arai Pastry
4 ||| The service here was great and the workers were very friendly and helpful. I split the medium Bobbie and medium capastrami with my friend, Pamela S. whose review is right below. They were very yummy and satisfying, needless to say it was a lot of food and I practically had a footlong leftover. The leftovers were great when I needed a drunken snack.
1 ||| The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal.  The service was good, but the food lacked flavor and was quite bland.  My steak fajitas and the peppers and onions that came with them were not flavorful at all.  The re fried beans were overcooked and were simply bad.  The queso app was OK, but nothing special.  With all the choices in central Phoenix, I will be going elsewhere for my Mexican fix.
0 ||| Omg. MOLD, mold everywhere!!!! \n\nI bought two potato filled pastry's we get 3/4 through eating them and my boyfriend goes \"Is that mold\" we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold. This was hours after they were purchased! \n\nIn about an hour we were both feeling sick, I threw up which was terrible. I'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got. I'm shocked. I eat out everyday and have NEVER EVER had an experience like this. \n\nI ordered Borsch off the menu as well, and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water (for $8.95) I have to say one word...\n\nHORRIFIED!
4 ||| Good food. Excellent service. The Dirtwater Springs was very, very good. We went to celebrate our anniversary. The restaurant was perfect for the ocassion. Its very expensive. We recommend Dirtwater Springs.
4 ||| This is probably the best north indian restaurant in Pittsburgh (Lawrenceville/Bloomfield). A bit of a dive with a traditional menu but the food is made fresh and the prices can't be beat.  The lunch buffet is a prety good deal (much less than $10!).
0 ||| OK so this is not the place to stay for sure.. We had a ton of issues .. The 1st room no heat  , then it was dirty, then the next room was old and smelly.. I will say the staff was ok . They are better places to stay for sure.
2 ||| Beer was cold. That is about all I got
4 ||| Yeah I know, a commercial establishment which I normally don't visit, however this location deserves a good Yelp! \n\nOpen 24/7, all donuts fresh fried and glazed. \n\nI walked in and looked at the display rack of fresh donuts, literally saw them glistening with their generous freshly just glazed icing. \n\n$7.99 for a dozen, well 14 donuts to be exact, not sure if that is standard or just because I walked in with two nice big plump donuts of my own? Anyhow that is a steal for fresh, moist, melt in your mouth donuts at 2am. \n\nService is great, I mean really I don't expect mind blowing service from a donut shop, much less at 2am. Also does not take much skill or thrill to fill a box with donuts. \n\nThe gentleman working this particular early morning shift had lots of spunk and vigor. He is one with tons of personality, joking and told me my total was 7 million dollars, you know those funny types. Really refreshing considering he works graveyard! \n\nYay Winchell's, (S. Jones location) as I can not speak for the rest as a lot of them are franchise now. \n\nThis location rocks!
1 ||| Not the best Embassy Suites I've stayed at but not the worst either.  Maybe the second worst?  The employees were super friendly and answered the few questions I had without pause.  The breakfast was on par with their other properties.  The guest room I was given is where they lost the stars.\n\nThe place is in need of some serious updating.  The room I stayed in had definitely seen better days.  The carpet, the light switches, the paint - everything looked tired and just about worn out.  Also, the smell of too-much carpet freshener seriously overpowered the senses.  I thought it would dissipate if I switched the fan selector to \"on\" instead of \"auto\" but I was mistaken.  I'm not sure what odor they were trying to cover up but I don't really want to know at this point.  Next time I'm in Charlotte I will stay somewhere else...and hopefully get a better night's sleep.
0 ||| Quite possibly the worst food I have ever had at a reputable restaurant. Some food was inedible salty and the veggies had no seasoning whatsoever. Terribly disappointing.
2 ||| We went earlier in the week because my aunt just totally loves the fried soft shell crab appetizer there.  I think I will have to beg to differ on this point.  Don't get me wrong.  It wasn't bad, but I think I've had way better at other comparable Japanese restaurants.  In addition to the average fried soft shell crab, we ordered two different boats, which was wayyyyy too much food for four people, filled with various sushi rolls of spicy tuna, california, eel, soft shell crab, skewers of chicken teriyaki, sashimi. \n\nConclusion:  Average food.  Definitely not my first choice to go to for Japanese food.
1 ||| I have some serious reservations about the cleanliness of this place.  Clutter is everywhere, the buffets did not look like they're been recently wiped down. And our table was sticky.  \n\nThe selection is not great.  The taste/quality of the food was good.  Service was fast and friendly.  \n\nI don't think I'd go back.
1 ||| I will never eat at another Denny's again. The good: Staff was great, very friendly, and make it feel like a relaxing place to enjoy your food, but the food is the problem. Food tasted horrible, and for what they charge is just ridiculous.
0 ||| I wouldn't even give ticketmaster even one star if I could. I bought tickets through living social for Disney on Ice.  Ticketmaster has a glitch in their system that wouldn't give me a discount as promised through Living social.  Ticketmaster says in no way are they responsible for the glitch. huh?  So instead of paying $80 for 4 tickets am I am now paying $145 for 4.  They won't fix the problem nor exchange or refund tickets. Ticketmaster has the worst customer service ever.  Will never go through them for anything. BIG FAT THUMBS DOWN!!
0 ||| Blech. We ate here over a year ago when we first moved here...never to return. It tasted like \"Mexican\" food you get in Kansas. Low quality and not very authentic. Sorry...didn't care for it at all.
3 ||| Love the food - not a fan of the atmosphere though.  The blueberry pancakes with the orange butter are fabulous and have completely changed the way I make pancakes at home.  I also love the breakfast sandwich - so good!  The one thing I don't like about the place is how loud it is - the acoustics of the place just seem to amplify everything and it gets too loud for me to really enjoy if it's super busy.
1 ||| I've yet to have a truly bad experience here, but the food takes an Eternity, the staff seem to hate working there and frequently forget to come back to the table. we live right by this denny's, and yet when we do our denny's get-togethers (unlimited pancakes are one of the few pluses.) We would much rather drive the extra few miles to the one on country club and southern.
4 ||| i like their lavender milk tea as well as their earl grey milk tea. i like how they're piping hot.
3 ||| Ok...you're either gonna love it or leave it. Nice view, however, the smell of poop from the cattle on site as you enter is *not* very appetizing. The service was *very* attentive and I've got mad props for any server that can refill my martini in under 60 seconds!!! Bad news is that a place that is known for steak...should NOT serve one over cooked and under seasoned. (RNSG in my eyes) Still a fun environment and a good place to take out of towners that don't know the difference between Meh vs OK.
0 ||| Dingy, dark, dirty, sticky -- that's your table. Greasy, unappealing, low quality -- that's your food. Someone obviously put a lot of time, money and love to build this business (from the decor I'm guessing it was once an interesting, somewhat upscale place). Today, it's a dump.\n\nI ordered the chile relenos. The beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless. There was more egg than chile, though it was hard to tell because of all the cheese congealing over the plate. I'll never go here again.
4 ||| This is a nice place to relax and have a drink or a meal while you're in the Chandler mall area. It's actually on the mall property, so it's easy walking distance from the mall itself and the nearby Harkins theater. I recommend hitting them for happy hour between 3-7 weekdays and then taking in some shopping or a movie.\n\nThe menu is rather extensive and most of the offerings are quite tasty. The avocado egg rolls in particular stand out, and they usually have interesting offerings like bratwurst sliders and other bar food. \n\nSome of the beers really stand out, and this is why you'd want to visit BJ's in the first place. If they have the seasonal Grand Cru, definitely give it a try, but don't plan on driving anywhere any time soon, as it's a very strong brew (10% abv). The porter and stout are very good. The hefeweizen is a bit watery and underwhelming.
4 ||| Pretty much my favorite Thai food in Vegas. Everything is inexpensive. Portions are huge. I got the stink eye from the waitress a couple times but this didn't negate the grub. \n\nTHE only BAD thing that happened when I was here was a few hours later my entire body broke out in red splotches. Didn't switch up what I ordered, so I figure something must have been added that I was allergic too. It has NOT deterred me from going there time and time again.
2 ||| The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each... If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good.
3 ||| So this is a place I'll come back to -- if other people want to go.  Meaning our experience was okay, with no big failures to keep me away, but I wasn't blown away by the food either.\n\nThe chips were good, if under salted, and the salsa's were alright.  The anathema I feel for cilantro means I'll ask for an alternative if all salsas include it.  They chopped up some fresh tomato, onion and jalape\u00f1o for me even though the hottest salsa was cilantro-free. This was actually one of the highlights - and much appreciated.\n\nMy chili relleno was very cheesy and beef enchilada pretty standard.  Filling and acceptable, though I agree with some other reviews that mention under-seasoned dishes.  The wife had a shredded beef taco and chicken enchilada which she was happy with.\n\nThe virgin strawberry margarita was freshly blended and completely finished by wifey - while my \"Julios Margarita\" on the rocks was your standard marg - tasty and sour and reasonably poured.\n\nSo we left - tummies filled, wallet appropriately dented, having been pleasantly served (if a little slow at the start given the very few late diners, but the speed the food came out made up for it).
0 ||| Very Unprofessional. Can Can bought the wrong wire for the job without checking what the appliance called for. Then got mad when he found out it called for different wire. He then proceeded to put his tools away and jumped in his truck and drove away without  a word. I would caution anyone thinking of using this company.
2 ||| Was looking for a change of pace recently. I love hidden treasures in the valley and figured I'd try this one. After all, it was rated 5 stars. I tried the chicken filet sandwich just like the picture. The first half was good until I noticed it was precooked frozen chicken, like the bags that Costco sells. Because of that I don't think I'll be coming here again. I feel that there are better sandwich shops around the area. 3/5 stars I feel is more than generous of a rating.
0 ||| This place has gone down hill.  I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.\nI go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.\nThe dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.\nI went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been \"had\".\nI should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*\nOn the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee.
4 ||| Best place in CU to see a band, and pretty good for other stuff, too. Assuming Pygmalion rolls through again sometime, this is the premier venue (other than lame Krannert).\n\nIf a band you dig is slated to play at the Canopy Club for less that $35, you should definitely go. The sound, staff, and variety of places to watch the band (including above in movie theatre style seats) make for a great indoor venue. The front room is also an intimate, charming if you will, experience, though the sound quality suffers.\n\nThey also have Tuesday night trivia at Canopy at 7pm, which is lots of fun. It is 6 rounds of 5 questions per round, and goes pretty fast. It is hosted by the occaisionally humorous (but nearly always bearable) Fishing with Dynamite players. Prizes aren't great, but it is a much better format than similar trivia nights in CU.\n\nYou can park across the street at Krannert garages, and they card hard, even if you are fully geezered like me. On off-nights (not Fri and Sat), there are always drink specials that make Canopy Club as cheap to drink at as any Green Street shit bar. However, the alternative nature of college music keeps the worst elements of undergrad anti-culture at bay.
0 ||| Unfortunately this is the only place on Lake Wylie to eat when you are out on your boat other than a snack bar. The deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business. If you want a drink order beer or wine. The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong.  The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor.  The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting.  The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre.  The fries were mushy and limp.   On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated.  The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place.  Hopefully everyone will also give up on it so a decent place can be moved in, but I think the building is beyond saving at this point.
1 ||| This place saddens me. It is a void. It has a sterile atmosphere. The sandwiches were dry and not very good. The prices were high. The only reason that I went was because they handed out coupons in my neighborhood. If I had to say something good about this place, it would be that it is clean.
4 ||| Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap.
0 ||| Highly overpriced!!  Even after you haggle down the price is above average with a lower than average quality product.  On top of that, their storage is tiny, so you have to come back later to pick your purchase up.\nEXAMPLE: Bought a TV stand. Waited THREE DAYS to be able to pick it up.  Waited in line for the pickup for nearly an hour. Got home and SIX PIECES WERE MISSING!! Called and they were happy to provide replacements, but I had to WAIT SIX MORE DAYS for the replacement parts to arrive. When we went to pick up the parts they were reluctant to give them to us. Ughh!
4 ||| The decor and ambiance is just perfectly retro at MacAlpine's.  From the awesome vintage soda fountain to the waitresses appropriately styled, I love the nostalgic vibe here. My favorite meal here would have to be the veggie burger with a carrot raisin salad as the side and whatever delicious shake I decide to gorge myself on for the day. My last shake there a couple days ago was the red velvet cake shake....It is the most wonderful liquid concoction I have had there yet! They are currently having an amazing sale on vintage items too! I scored a cute grey handbag for less than $10!!
1 ||| 2 stars for good prices & a nice manager .. But expect cold wedges (fries) and loud, ghetto females at this location who laugh at every person as their walking out
4 ||| why am I writing a review about my favorite bar? I mean, I was there last friday night and there were all these hipbros (Jack Threads dressed kinda fratty dudes) and they were all loud and dumb. Did they read reviews and decide to show up? Was one of my friends responsible for this, possibly telling one of their work mates about a fun downtown bar? Oh shit... I\"m becoming part of the problem. Well.. the deal is the Rail is the shit. and the owner isn't trying to become some tycoon. He's a pretty sweet older dude. The bartenders are great, the juke box can be a bit fun, the dart are plastic and shitty. This is what rocks. The beers pour nicely. The booze is mighty fine. No redbull or credit card jerkasses. this is to keep things real.\nAre you kinda chill, a bit outside the box? stop in. Are you a douche? eh, you still deserve a shot of fireball... then leave.
3 ||| Overall I like this place.  The beers are good and the they give you large portions (which any respectable manly man looks for in a draft house.)\n\nThe food is a bit inconsistent.  I had an excellent steak a few weeks ago and last night it was just OK.  Almost seems like they used a different grade of beef.  The host may have been a bit slow or off his game, but he waited for me to ask for a table before saying anything.  Doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you think about it, it can get awkward fast.\n\nThe beverages are always good though, so if nothing else go and try the house brews.
0 ||| Met some friends here last night with high expectations due to good reviews. We had a party of 10 so we made sure we were there right when they opened at 5pm. They sat us immediately but when  we asked them up front (before we ordered) to split the checks they had a bit of an attitude. We made it a game to get them to lighten up. Which they did! A for effort on the waitresses part. We had her laughing and smiling.  I should mention here that when we walked in it smelled fishy as well. Not a good sign for a sushi place. This should have been our second red flag. Food came fairly quickly. It was ok nothing special and a bit overpriced for what you get. Towards the end they started to rush to get us out which we would have gladly done 30 minutes prior if they would bring our checks. By the time we got home I was extremely sick and that was how the rest of my night went! I am not new to sushi. In fact its my fav! I would NEVER go back to this place. The only reason its getting 1 star is because the waitress was a hoot!
4 ||| I don't go to the barber often.Infact I havent been to a barber since I was 7, but I came here today with my brothers and these guys are Awesome, very friendly environment. Laid back and chilled out. Has a cowboy feel to it. They also do straight razor shaves. My brother got one and it looked great. It was a pretty far drive,but I don't care,this place is worth it. Will definitely come back.
2 ||| There is definitely something going on with this store.  We've shopped here on and off for several years.  Last time in this store the shelves were nearly empty and many aisles just had fillers on the shelves and not what was supposed to be there.  I bought some short ribs, which were fine, but they didn't have any Kalbi sauce which is extremely weird (they typically have hundreds of bottles).  I asked the cashier if they were closing the store and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about and everything in the store was \"normal\".  We'll see.  Hopefully it won't close.
4 ||| I love Brueggers, this location is quite gat, you can get your bagel and coffee at the same place and come here to study, remind or catch up with friends! This location is attached to caribou coffee. I personally think that Brueggers is better than Einstein bagels. Einstein bagels reminds me of more McDonald type breakfast and Brueggers is fresher better ingredients, not to mention a million type of bagel selections!! This place is only open for breakfast and lunch. I've gotten the smoked salmon bagel for lunch and it comes with my choice of veggies, all fresh and crunchy! I usually get the sun dried tomato with egg white bagel for breakfast. I also tried the spinach and egg bagel, also very good! I love how great my bagel taste after it's toasted! Yes, I am indeed a fan!
4 ||| It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  The idea that they would just sell you hot dogs and six-packs is so just and pure it almost makes me want to weep.  \n\nI went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish, kraut, and brown mustard.  Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.  \n\nAgain, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good.....
3 ||| I'm in Madison for a conference and staying at the Best Western Inn on the Park (also recommended--see my review).  I needed to grab some lunch, but I wanted a place that sold a good salad (not always the easiest thing to find) and I needed something fast.  \n\nSo, I looked up what was nearby on Yelp and Marigold Kitchen got so many good ratings, I had to try it.  I ordered for pick up over the phone and the woman who answered was unbelievably nice and accommodating.  I wanted a salad, but also wanted a piece of fish on top and their salmon just didn't sound appealing at that moment.  So I asked if they could put the tilapia filet (from their sandwiches) on top of the Marigold salad.  It cost $5 more, but they did it and it was fantastic!  The tilapia was nice and peppery and the salad was a perfect mix of sweet/tangy/salty (tomato/corn/balsamic/black olives).\n\nAnd it only took them 15 quick minutes to make it.  Perfect!
1 ||| Parking is not included in ur room. Also when checking in its quickly told to move ur car or it will get towed.ts awkward when ur hre for a family function and someone has to run in the rain. also parking is 14 per room. !!!: /   The topper was when we arrived there were tons of spaces for parking in thier lot. The breakfast in the morning wasnt to great  but the people that work there were friendly. I did like my hotel room. The rooms are modern and big. I dont think Id stay here again bc of the parking.
3 ||| At 2am on a weekend night, the clientele is colorful, the service friendly and the food...well just forget about the food.  The food ranges from mediocre to bland.  Just be grateful there is a colorful place to go for a late night meal.
2 ||| Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.
4 ||| Yum! After reading several reviews about other Mexican restaurants in the area, I decided to take my friends to Abuelos and I'm so glad I did! We started off with the Dip Sampler which was yummy & hot! The chips were endless and the waitress happily accommodated our requests for a spicier salsa. My friends ordered the Avocado enchiladas and the beef enchiladas with a crunchy chicken taco on the side. Both couldn't stop raving about the fresh ingredients and authentic taste. I ordered the Shrimp Yucatan Fajitas. They came out sizzling and were delicious! \n\nThe waitress was so friendly and helpful, the layout of the restaurant was authentic and kind of gave us a feel of the Venetian in Vegas with the high domed ceiling. I will definitely go back to Abuelos!
4 ||| Authentic Cantonese restaurant with great Dim Sum.  I was there when it just opened and frequented it when it was relatively new and I haven't had the chance to visit for a few years so hopefully things haven't changed.
1 ||| decent sushi and amazing mock chicken dishes, regular chinese food is sub-par.
2 ||| Well I guess I don't reall have anything good to say about this place, but not anything bad either.  I've been here a few times with friends and by myself, and nothing ever really strikes me or disappoints me.  The food is okay.  The waitstaff is okay.  It's normally pretty empty when I go.  I think if you're gonna have a cool concept then stick to it and make it stand out.  I get the whole dark makeup thing, but it's stil not doing it for me. I guess I'd say go there if you enjoy mediocrity.
4 ||| Ate here for lunch last weekend for the first time in over 8 years. I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere! \n\nThe lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri. \n\nI also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the \"salad\" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.\n\nYou can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed! I haven't ever seen fried shumai, but I tried a small bite and it was decent but greasy. \n\nI was glad that the small amount of sushi I had with lunch was as tasty and fresh as ever-I will definitely be back for more!
2 ||| I really wish we could do half stars; I would rate my visit 2.5. I went alone for lunch, walked in and waited a couple of minutes, then sat down at the entrance. Finally a girl came out and asked if I needed something. I wanted to say yeah, a table, but instead asked if I should seat myself. She said yes and handed me a menu. I guess the regulars know this, but a sign would have been nice. \n\nI ordered the country style steak with fried squash and stewed okra and tomatoes. The steak was ok, but the gravy tasted canned. The squash reminded me of squash I used to get from a Bi-Lo deli when I worked nearby. It was heavily breaded and I prefer fried squash thin and lightly breaded, but it was the best part of the meal (besides the roll) so I finished it. The okra was a big disappointment. I expected it to be more tomatoey and stewey I guess, rather than a bowl of okra with a chunk or two of tomato. It was extremely under seasoned, if seasoned at all. At least the okra wasn't slimy. The roll was amazing and the cornbread was good enough to eat. \n\nI tried to signal I was done by putting my napkin in my plate and playing on my phone, but my waitress walked right by me and sat down talking to some regulars. I wasn't annoyed by this until it lasted more than 5 minutes.\n\nEven though I ate enough to not be hungry, I had to fight the urge to stop and get something else on the way home.
3 ||| Really good crab rangoons.  Lots of choices of bubble tea.\nI almost always get the Signapore rice noodles or the Pad Thai.\n\nSince it's in Oakland, you're going to see quite a few students.  Sometimes it can be noisy during busy hours.
4 ||| Absolutely delicious, flawless chicken and waffles.  A must-try if you love fried chicken and/or waffles.\n\nOne item of note though: coffee is $3.  Yes, three dollars.  It was fine, but I think I paid about six times what I would have paid at Starbucks.  So that seemed a bit high to me.  However, the food was delicious and well worth it.\n\nA very cool vibe, clean, bright, well-maintained with great photos and art all over the place.  Gospel music playing loud at 7AM on a Friday morning.  A great waitress.  A lot of fun.
4 ||| I love me some RA.. Enroute to Oreganos Mark turns the Bimmah towards Kierland and says.. Sushi?? .. yep.. sounds like a plan.. We expect to wait.. Dont mind valeting.. ( I mean is it just me or are the parking sizes in Kierland meant for matchbox cars??).. But as we watch the blonde eye the guy behind us.. tell us that there should be a patio table in like 5.. as she adjusts her white bra under her black revealing dress.. we move towards the bar wondering.. WTH?.. Oh well.. its still happy hour.. I love Ra Sake Sangria.. yum.. bartender is cool.. and hes wondering where our buzzer is??? Yeah as a MOF.. we are too now!.. Duh.. Now Im a dumb blonde at times.. but this girl is off her ra! So Mark starts to go ask.. but Mr. Nice Bartender Man.. says hes got this one.. as he makes another Sake Sangria for Mark and gives me the extra.. score..:-) and a second or two later.. problem solved , we are out on the cool yet warm--esque patio.. There really isnt a roll on RA's menu I dont like.. other than the scallop.. ech.. but this time they are a bit slow.. and for RA this night isnt over the top busy..Nonetheless...Im always pretty much a fan..now for that hostess.. hmmmmm
4 ||| Yummy!  I had the Baja Burro...it was heaven.  The jalapeno cream cheese was drizzled over my yummy deep fried chimichanga.\n\nVery tasty.  Great Service too.  Went on a Saturday night but by the time we were done....the restaurant was filling up with patrons.
0 ||| I've never been treated so poorly in my entire life by any store no matter what they were selling.  Nor have I ever been lied to so much and had people so unwilling to help me.\n\nI spoke with Verizon's corp center in which a supervisor had given me the address for this location and told me I was within my 14 days to return everything and cancel my contract.  I was told by 2 people at Verizon I was able to cancel my contract and i just needed to drive down and have them take it for me.  However when I got down there the company lied to me and told me that these two people put in the notes that they specifically told me i COULDN'T return the phone.\n\nWeird because when i called Verizon's corp center after leaving the store, they told me the notes actually indicated i was within my 14 days and i could return the phone.  They also informed me it reads specifically on Verizon's website in their customer agreement that i could cancel and return everything 14 days from ACTIVATION for full refund.\n\nHowever when i took my evidence down to the store they STILL refused to take it back.  So I told them to simply cancel the service, I'll sell the phone on ebay.  Well AJ is her name, and she \"cancelled\" my service alright.  I made her give me a receipt and had a witness drive down. AJ didn't really cancel anything, she put a FUTURE cancel date that way it would be outside of my 14 day window and I'd be forced to pay the term fees!!!  Not only that but the moment she approached me she started talking nasty to me about kicking me out of the store if I speak to her the way i spoke with someone on my PERSONAL phone conversation.  It's none of her business what i say to someone on a personal call, i could have found out my husband was cheating for all she knew.  And i was nothing but kind to the first two reps so i'm not sure why she had an attitude and assumed things about me.\n\nThe so called manager mr McDonald was also RUDE towards me and still refused to let me return the phone even though company rules said i could.  I hope Verizon realizes the sort of people that are running their stores.\n\nI have to admit, there were 2 kind employees there out of the 5 I talked with. They seemed to think what was happening with me wasn't fair and they tried to secretly help me, but it's weird they were trying to do it behind their boss' back, like helping customers were against company policy. Some store manager that would fear his employees into treating customers like crap.\n\nI would say NEVER go to this store location and never go to Verizon period. Find any company on the planet but they don't deserve your money.  And if you must go to  Verizon, take your dollars and the commission to another store location, but this one does NOT deserve anything from anyone.  If anything they deserve an under cover agent from Verizon investigating the way they treat people.  Because I have friends with verizon and I've gone with them into Verizon stores, NEVER in my life have i been treated so poorly.
0 ||| Seriously the worse food for Mexican food. Food was either too salty or too bland. Order the \"Wet Bean/Cheese Burrito\" and 12 rolled tacos. Burrito was horrible assembled and the red sauce was way too salty. The tolled tacos we bland and the guacamole was watered down. I know I don't come here for the service cause it sucks. Lady who took my order was rude, horribly representing service. Food was priced OK but they charge extra to use your credit card and if you want refills on your drinks. \nFor this type of food place, I would totally recommend to go to Don Tortaco or Tacos el Gordo. Way better price, service, and quality.
4 ||| In exchange for watching our little one, my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? I'm game!\n\nWhen we first arrived, I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot, right next to a cabinet place. But, I'm learning to be adventurous, so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!\n\nWe showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess, where we were greeted by, arguably, the most cheerful, interactive, and helpful waitress I've ever encountered. Thank you, Luana.\n\nWe looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called \"kids\" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.\n\nAs for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.\n\nThe three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated, though, as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But, whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!\n\nIf you're looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options, awesome atmosphere, a patio, and (in our case), the greatest service we've experienced in QUITE some time, then you should definitely stop by!
4 ||| This is Litchfield Park's version of Cheers. Great food, amazing staff, perfect place if you're a local because you'll run into someone you know. Even if you're visiting, everyone is friendly in The Park. Enjoy!
2 ||| Like a Denny's. Big parking lot and short walk to the door   Wait to be seated. The place looked unkept but the only waiter was quick to take our order and the food arrived fast. Can't complain about the price. A chef salad and deep fried shrimp dinner for $15.
2 ||| Dr. Lance P. Schneder was OK, but didn't have much of a bedside manner. \n\nI came here after a failed root canal by my dentist at the time. The doctor did an OK job, but he was very rough with my mouth and lips. He didn't use an assistant very often during the procedure  - maybe it wasn't necessary? - and would put his tools on my chest as he worked. (Yeah I know, weird, but I was too busy worry about losing my lips to his rough movements.)\n\nHis office sent a box of Fairytale Brownies about a week later. That was a nice touch, but didn't make up for the rough handling.
4 ||| Nice facility with good prices.  The location isn't great for me but the price for the self serve dog wash is wonderful!  It cosy me 16 $ for the dog wash. 2 $1 dollar greenies, and a bag of treats.  The 4 dog tubs are in a separate room attached to the store.  It has anything you need and then some.  The tubs line a wall so you can't walk around your puppy when you are bathing them, but 4 types of shampoos are in dispensers attached to the wall of each tub.  A tool box full of combs, ear cleaning and cologne is also available.  The store has all sorts of treats and foods for dogs and cats.  Single chews, pugs ears, hoofs, you name it are available to mix and match.  If you have a dog, go in.
3 ||| We ended up here one night as dessert refugees after a hugely disappointing meal at Vincent's on Camelback.  They were booked for the night but found us a table on the patio so we could enjoy at least one tasty morsel in our evening.  The tarts were fabulous, the owner who seated us was extremely accommodating and we were determined to come back.  \n\nLast night, we had dinner there.  It was a pleasant enough experience but I didn't it find it worth the cost (and we had a Groupon!).  I did not find the portions to be tiny as another reviewer said.  My filet was tasty enough but sadly, I had a better cooked filet earlier in the week at Charleston's for about $10 less.  My key lime tart was delicious but it was about 80% crust and 20% filling (I'm more of a filling girl than a crust girl).  My companions ordered the peanut butter mousse dessert and it was very tasty.  It would have been extra tasty with a wee bit more salt.  \n\nIt's definitely a cute venue although I don't understand the distinctions about being a great \"date night\" place because it is quite small and privacy is limited.  It was a nice enough place but definitely didn't \"wow\" me.
1 ||| May be I went on a bad day for the kitchen, but the dishes I had was well below the average touristy level.\n\n- the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned\n- the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato, half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef\n- the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy (no, not in a good way)\n- the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be better\n\nLa Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot.  But it looks like I'll have to keep on passing on by.
3 ||| I had heard mulitple extremely good comments about \"I love sushi\" and decided to give it try, even though i am not the biggest sushi fan.  The first thing I noticed when we sat down was the big menu with such great options... The screaming orgasm is absolutely to die for.  Price is good, service is ok.  Wouldn't say it's great, wouldn't say it's bad.  Overall, it's very enjoyable.
1 ||| What happened to Mimi's? The menu has changed again and not for the better.\nWe arrived at 9PM and no one was at the door to greet us...for a long time we waited, then I wen tin search of someone. Finally found someone and I asked if they were closed. He said no and sat us. The restaurant was pretty empty. I never saw anyone else on the floor working.\nThe server was not friendly at all. Service very slow. Then again this might be a management problem too since one person cannot do everything in a full service restaurant and do a good job.  I ordered the chicken crepes. They were pictured on menu and looked good.\nI received a hot plate with cold food. They were actually cold inside so I am not sure if they sat that long or if they are premade and were not heated through. \nIt took a long time but I finally got the attention of the waiter and asked him to please heat them up. \nHe grabbed the plate and came back later with them hot. The crepes were still undercooked and mushy but the inside was hot.  The salad was wilted when he returned.  The waiter never said he was sorry or is it better or kiss my behind.  He just dropped it off and went away.  I did eat a couple more bites and decided that I was not willing to eat calories when the food is bad so that was the end of my dinner.\nMy husband had the Tuna Sandwich and it was different then they used  to make it and no longer on the menu that he could find.\nWe waited a long time again. Finally got his attention and asked for the check.\nHe never asked if we wanted dessert or asked if I wanted the mushy mess to take with me, or at least ask what was wrong with it.\nWe finally got the check, paid for it before he could take off again and left.\nMimi's used be so good. Maybe the economy has made them cut down on labor to try to make a profit. The bad thing about that is you cut down on service too.\nI never thought I would prefer IHOP but the food is hot and the service is better.
3 ||| Smells really good outside of Winchells. Got a half dozen for only $5. Donuts look fresh and delicious. Hope they taste as good as they look.
3 ||| Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns.  Hard to beat that.\n\nLocation is next to Einstein's, Starbucks, and Chipotle - so whether it is breakfast or dinner, there's a superior alternative in the same parking lot.
4 ||| WONDERFUL. This restaurant has really gotten it right. Fabulous menu, service, five stars for a job perfectly done!
1 ||| I just wanted an oil change and I get quoted $400 to replace an oil pan and oil drain plug.
0 ||| Am captive in corporate cafeteria they cater to. Today there were feathers still on roasted chicken. According to manager the chickens come wrapped in plastic?  Ok, so does that mean you dont have to wash them or look at them before putting in the oven?  Wilted lettuce, grumpy grill cooks, soggy breakfast burritos, weak coffee round out a typical day at this cafe.
4 ||| What a great place in an unexpected location. The place was in the middle of nowhere and completely packed. It was nice to see horses tied to the fence, bikers, couples and family's enjoying a wonderful outdoor atmosphere. The food was great, service a little slow, but they seemed understaffed so we didn't mind. Heard they have live music on certain days, so we must check that out soon! Great place...great crowd! Thumbs up!
0 ||| Head-scratch for sure. I'm going to go out on a limb on this one and normally I don't bother writing a review for a place that already has a lot of opinions, BUT I have to say that I disagree with the vast majority.\nI just don't get why this place has a wait but it makes me think that I should quit my stupid corporate job and open up a sushi place and make a killing.  \n\nAs one of the 50 (if that) asians in this state and having lived in DC, NYC, and SF this place is 1 notch above RA Sushi.  In other words, if you're from out of town DO NOT eat sushi while you're here. I'd rather make the drive out to LA.  What it's only 7 or 8 hours away.  \n\nBut i guess if you pick up pre-packaged \"sushi\" from a grocery market like AJs this place might meet your expectation of a good sushi experience. Just remember to order the imitation krab meat and fish with the rice.\nAgain, a warning to those that come from out of town and looking for good places to eat, hold off on sushi until you leave town. Would you eat Mexican food whiie visitng Osaka?  It's a sucker bet.
4 ||| My name is Demetria and I'm a Belk-a-holic........Belk Southpark is my favorite department store.....yeah, I know it's not a big time department store like Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus, etc, but I know for a fact their additional 50% off red dot sales cannot be touched by any of the other high end stores around. So if you like the name brand's but not the prices checkout a red dot sale at Belk Southpark, you won't be disappointed.
1 ||| This was my first visit. I had heard good things, so maybe my expectations were set too high. My boyfriend and I decided to share a few items: small ceasar salad, 10 inch wing pizza, and an order of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. The ceasar was good, the dressing was not overly creamy or heavy, it actually had a hint of spice to it,  which I liked a lot. Next came the pasta dish. I was really looking forward to this dish, so I was disappointed when all of the angel hair was basically sitting in a puddle of water with globs of marinara dispersed throughout the bowl. I'm sure the actual marinara was good, but it was almost impossible to taste due to all the water in the bowl. The pizza was definitely the highlight of the meal. Thick, deep crust pizza with good chunks of buffalo chicken. Overall, their food is ok, I'd just stick with the pizza. I would, however, like to note that my overall dining experience was not that great and is really the reason I probably wouldn't come back. We were sat at the far booth in the bar area. There was a smaller cocktail table situated within 2 feet of my seat. Right after being sat,  a man who I presume to be the owner or off duty manager sat down at that table with his beer. Nothing wrong with that. Except that throughout our 45 min or so visit, the man and his employees were conversing about their Christmas parties, wedding plans, and work drama/gossip that I honestly didn't care to hear about as a patron, but couldn't help to hear because of their proximity to us. Kinda killed the vibe we were going for and made us want to leave as quickly as possible. I'm in the industry myself, and I totally understand grabbing a beer and unwinding after work,  but not at the expense of the customers' experience.
3 ||| The service was fast & easy, I just had to call ahead of time to make an appointment. I just thought the price could have been better; $35 for an IVP fingerprint card seemed like a lot, but it's a niche market. Overall I would recommend it.
4 ||| Best place! I've been going here for years. After moving to the other side of town in Henderson, I've tried a few other places and kept thinking to myself, \"I miss Johnathan and Lani.\" They are so friendly and they do great quality work. No matter where I go, I find myself driving back to them. My nails last for 2 and a half weeks every time and always look flawless.
4 ||| Had the ramen, yellowtail tar tar, eel roll with tempura (forgot the name), spider roll & honey toast. Everything was great! Worth the wait & I'll definitely eat there again when I'm in Vegas!
0 ||| With this location being at a busy intersection off an exit from the Parkway makes it almost a nightmare to use this place.  Hardly any parking if you don't need to actually get gas.\n\nThe inside of the store is on the small side as well.  Doesn't help that the store part is changing from the BP branded store to a 7-eleven.  I swear that they decided it was amazing to put in an ATM that was four times the size than what was there before.  Be careful not to trip over the loose floor tiles as well.\n\nNot very many choices for gas off the Edgewood/Swissvale exit, so maybe wait to go to another location.
4 ||| I LOOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEEEEE jambalaya. \nYea, I will drive up there just to buy 2 order to go and eat them during the week. (go figure)
4 ||| i almost didn't take my car here when i saw the other review, but discount recommended them...\nmy experience was great-everyone there was really nice, got my car in the garage right away (had an appointment), got the alignment done, and i even added on an oil change. i'd go there again.
4 ||| Really liked Linda. I only had color done, but service was good. My daughter liked the waiting area. It was comfortable for her. The music videos were a bonus.
2 ||| Came here twice on 'goth' night.  Both times the place was dead.  Probably no more than 10 people in the entire place with only 2 people dancing on the large dance floor.  I just don't understand why they can't get people in here and even more puzzling is the fact that they are able to remain open despite the lack of patronage.
4 ||| BOOOOOMB. love bagels. For sure best bagels ever. I love all the different types of cream cheese and the service is always really fast! Also super cheap!
3 ||| Fantastic food! Really excellent. My only suggestion for the restaurant: please serve red wine in red wine glasses. Otherwise a 5-star.
4 ||| The only reason this is a three and not a two is because no matter who you bring to this place (Veg-head, Health-nut, or even fast foodies, etc.), they will be satisfied by the selection.  But it never fails that there about a billion kids there and it's such a cafeteria setting that it makes me feel like I'm eating at a hospital.  The last time I went there was an evil little kid sitting behind me in the next booth that would not quit kicking me.  Word to the wise...DO NOT SEAT PEOPLE WITHOUT KIDS NEXT TO KIDS!!!!!  SERIOUSLY!  It ruins a dinning experience even if you are used to them (even if you have them!  If you left them at home there is probably a reason!).  This has always been my biggest pet peeve.  We finally got babies out of movie theaters now we need to work on family seating!  Not that it matters much in this place, because sound carries so well that it should be an auditorium, not a restaurant.  The food, I've never been able to complain about, though you may have to wait if it's a popular menu item, cooks can only go so fast and it's literally a free-for-all some days.  So, my vote is if you have a picky eater, go here, if you have a snobby eater, avoid!
0 ||| Don't do delivery.\nMy food came totally messed up in every way. Not good at all.
2 ||| Pretty decent. \nBut I think all Chinese in Madison is pretty decent. \nNothing has truly blown me away, this place included. \nWhile staff is nice and carryout is quick, food I ordered (veggie fried rice and Mongolian chicken) just didn't have much flavor. Like at all. The menu is extensive, though, and maybe I need to head back there to try more of it? They make a big claim that if you don't see it on their menu they'll find a way to make it, however that didn't hold true when I asked about Cantonese pan fried noodles... an item that seems near impossible to find in this town.
4 ||| The original reviewer covers most of I have to say about this place. Everyone working is fantastic in helping you find what you need.  The food is fantastic (I had the kebab) and the servings generous.  I probably should have made two meals out of what they gave me, instead of eating it all in one go.  If you can apply the concept of hospitality to a grocery store, this place would fit the bill.\n\nThe grocery is small, but nice, with a variety of spices essential to cooking Middle Eastern and South Asian food, as well as a number of things like pita, mango drinks, figs and dates, and sweets. I've yet to try the butcher.  The prices are very reasonable.
4 ||| Another place in  Vegas!  Thai food this time. I loved this place too, but not as much as I loved Meskerem. We brought a lot more people, we drank sake, spent a lot of money on food, put dares on people eating spicy food (which ended up being hilarious), and the servers were all very polite and respectful and again, another place in Vegas that stayed open later than their posted hours. \n\nI think we had 16 people with us? Maybe more? And the servers handled all of us extremely well. I got pad thai with vegan chicken at like maybe a 10 spice? it was perfect.\n\nProbably the best vegan pad thai I've ever had.
0 ||| Ah...first impressions are important. First impression of this location....can I stay somewhere else??? We had  to since we had a good rate. Construction workers littered the front of the building smoking cigarettes. Can you guys move so we can check in? They literally wouldn't move and hubby had to carefully maneuver our vehicle around them.\n\nInside the SMALL Lobby had a couch that had a rip in it.\nRoom had a TV With an attached sticker that read \"TV only works here in 3 languages\". That tells you a lot about this place.\nShower only, no tub. Light over bathroom sink blew out.\nNo lamps on each side of the bed. Hubby had to cover his head so I could stay up late reading. (Yes I know I should have brought a book light!)\nOK, it was only for one night and we were supposed to be in a nonsmoking room, so why did our room smell of smoking???? I didn't' sleep much (neither did hubby) and I woke up with a sore throat.....\ncheck out and on our way! Yea!!! \nIf you must stay here then it is adequate, to a fault, otherwise there are better choices around.
4 ||| Best ph\u00f3 in Vegas.
4 ||| This is a great dive bar.  We were there on off nights and it was a pretty sparse crowd, but we were kept amused by all the straights coming in and getting liquored up before going to the straight bathhouse.  Bartenders were friendly and the locals were welcoming...
2 ||| Hung out here while waiting for a movie. Nice outside patio area to hang out. Staff was kinda rude when I asked some questions.
4 ||| Why, why, WHY has no one told me about this place! This place is EXACTLY what I want when I go out to breakfast!\n\nThe location:\nTotally tucked into that strip mall at 4oth & Greenway where most people (including me) never get past Starbucks and The Gelato Spot. Small inside, but feels cozy. \n\nThe service:\nAwesome- nice ladies who fill up your coffee, are sweet to your kid and know that what they do is based on immediately making you feel comfortable. On a related note for those of you with kids- There is NOTHING I appreciate more at a restaurant than a server who 1) gets your kids food out as soon as possible. Eating kid = happy kid and 2) hands YOU the hot plate so you can take care of it, rather than dropping the plate in front of your 2 year old, announcing it's hot and leaving. DUH!\n\nThe food:\nFantastic- I had the chicken and veggie skillet. I never order skillets because they are always greasy and loaded with cheese. I took a risk and it paid off! Perfect combo of yummy but  not, I need to purge after this!\n\nThe price:\nJust right, a LOT of food for not  a lot of money. Me, the wife, and our full size 2 year old ate for under $25. And let's just say I took food home- NEVER happens :)\n\nThe customers:\nTotally cool- the place is full of regulars who were all nice to our little one. It didn't hurt that he went table to table saying goodbye on our way out, but nothing makes me want to smash a face as much as a person who is rude to my kid so mad props to the regs!\n\nAll in all, this place  is just my speed and we will be back... A LOT!
4 ||| Great little sushi spot with a heck of an all-u-can eat deal.  I like it.  The staff is great, the food is great quality and the prices are fair.  My only complaint: Nearly every time I leave Sushi Q I get hit up by the pan handlers working the liquor store next door.  4 stars for price, quality, and staff.
3 ||| Bread is great but not enough meat on the subs. Buts it's also owned by different people then the one near uptown Charlotte.
3 ||| Ok - I'm going to go with four stars because this is one of the very few places  that I've found you can go for a late night dessert and coffee. The coffee doesn't stand out but the desserts yum! The best part is they don't make it feel odd just coming for the sweets.
4 ||| Kids eat free on Mondays between 4:30 to close.  Food is great.  Kids meals are awesome and healthy.  Love this place!!!
4 ||| Thursday night I went to dinner with a friend in the Sonoma Steakhouse. The Steakhouse was nearly empty at 7:30 when we were seated. Francisco, the waiter was attentive to detail and the food was good. My petite filet mignon was top quality, but the Caesar's salad seemed like it had been made several hours earlier. All in all, the dining experience was above average and the atmosphere was intimate and classy.
1 ||| Those of us who spend their hard earned money on staying pretty by getting nail services, know that it's important to spend your money at a good quality place. The only good, pleasant nail tech is Don. He is pleasant and does a great job. Everyone else is rude and too fast when they do your nails. \n\nThe owner Wendy is completely rude and treats you like crap. I was sitting in the chair waiting for Don to arrive and she told her staff to ask me to move so people wouldn't think there was a wait.  Then she went on to talk about me and another lady in the shop which made it very awkward. She is a horrible business owner. They rush you out and don't do a good job. \n\nI would suggest to try another nail salon!
2 ||| Service when it came was good.  But folks got lost for a while so it took a bit for someone to actually show up to take our order, which was odd since the place was near empty.\n\nAs for the food, I had relatively low expectations for sushi in Arizona so I was willing to be generous.  Having said that, the food was merely adequate...neither bad, nor good.  But what was really weird was that everything (keep in mind we're talking sushi here) came out warm.  I gotta admit that was a first for sushi I've had anywhere...and that covers a lot of territory around the world.
0 ||| First mexican food I tried in Arizona it was bland and tasteless! Really, I was extremely disappointed and this place was recommended!!  It was pricey for dinner and so not worth the money, I have to say I may try it again maybe I ordered the wrong thing!!  Lovely atmosphere, friendly staff but husband and I both were disappointed, we both had something different.  I see the commercials and wonder where they were when I was there.  How can you mess up tacos?????
0 ||| If you are used to staying in Embassy Suites, don't think you will get the same quality here just because it's called Embassy Suites. There is no center atrium, the doors are all exposed to the outside like an inside out motel, and the rooms are dated. My visit had a couple other problems, which taken one at a time, are typical of any hotel but in combination, they ruined my stay. I think Hilton should change the name to something else.
4 ||| I recently went to this See's to get a few Christmas presents. First of all, this place is awesome because right when you walk in they have free samples! The store was very clean and the people who work here are exceptionally nice. I wanted to buy a Bordeaux bar (for my mom - its her fave). The girl behind the candy counter gave me a few Bordeaux samples since they were all sold out of the prepackaged ones. They offer city employees, employees in Alhambra school district and a bunch of other companies a discount at this location.
3 ||| I was here looking for some workout equipment. I ended up getting a couple weights and an adjustable bench. The prices were pretty good and I had better luck looking for the equipment I needed than at one of the big name stores. I would have rated this place better if we had better customer service and the place didn't look like a mess. I had to constantly watch my step and make sure I didn't trip over any of the junk that laid all over the store. I would come back though because there was a great selection of new and used workout equipment.
1 ||| There is one lady at the Customer Service counter who is terrible. She had a rude attitude with me when I tried to return something without a receipt. She kept asking if I was sure I bought it there. I wanted to laugh in her face. It was like pulling teeth trying to get store credit!\n\nI added a star because I HAVE encountered friendly staff here, but this particular lady needs to take her bad attitude outside of her workplace.
4 ||| Hmm . . . .it's 8:00pm on a  Monday night and I find myself in Madison, WI -hungry, tired and looking for a place that is close by to my hotel to grab some dinner.\n\nI am pointed toward Johnny's and low and behold- my entire evening turns around.  Great corner window seat to watch the happenings in downtown Madison? Check.  Very dirty martini served quickly WITH blue cheese olives?  Check.  A menu with alot of choices beyond steak AND fresh oysters?  Check.   Okay.  A few days in Madison is starting to look up.\n\nWe scoured the menu and finally decided on non beef entrees (daring in a steakhouse and that is pretty much what Johnny's is)- scallops for a colleague and seared ahi tuna for me. Delicious! Both come with this amazing salad with pine nuts, goat cheese and greens tossed with balsamic vinegar.  Terrific!\n\nWe stuck to mixed drinks but the wine list was also intriguing.  Other than a server that disappeared for lengths at a time and had to be hunted down- and a cracked martini glass (didn't want to waste a drop) this was a pretty good evening.\n\nDinner for two with drinks and dessert was about $100 which was cheap given the amount of food we had.\n\nSo the next time you see me and I am still going on and on about Johnny-no- I didn't meet a new man. Just a new place that will definitely go on my list to visit the next time I am in Madison.
4 ||| MIght very well be my favorite place to people watch in AZ.  Post up at the Zinc bar with your girl and a martini on a Friday night and just watch the people.\n\nWonderful place.  Get the French Onion soup.
2 ||| Not bad. That's about all I can say.
3 ||| Great specials. Today was chicken tender wrap $5.99 um um good
2 ||| Place rules. Its got a college atmosphere and some of the most ridiculous, albeit tasty, pizzabominations I've ever been privy to.\n\nLast time I was there, I got some taco thing with black beans, lettuce, sour cream and beef and probably more stuff I'm forgetting. It was stupid good.\n\nI also got a slice of the obligatory mac-and-cheese pizza. It's not bad, but in retrospect, I would have gone with something else; the novelty wears off around bite #3.\n\nOne beef I have is that it gets crowded. It's not a terribly huge place to dine in, but Madison is a nice town...just take it on the road, son.\n\nIf you're looking for your blas\u00e8 cheese and pepperoni sleepytime-boring pizza, look elsewhere. Ian's slaps you in the face with outlandish.
1 ||| For years I took my children to Dr. Sina. I did this despite Dr. Sina. I always loved her staff and at one point Dr. Cat who is no longer there.  Dr. Sina has a horrible bed side manner and at times is down right rude.  The final straw was when she said my child needed a baby root canal and crown.  We went to a new dentist fire a second opinion and all that was needed was a large filling. Also,  my other child was told he had 4 yes 4 cavities that needed to be filled,  we took him for a second opinion also and find out he needed none,  zero, nothing, no fillings. The 4 previous filings that she had done now have to be followed by the new dentist because they were fine incorrectly. The same 4 original filings that she did incorrectly she was trying to redo by trekking me he had 4 new cavities.  I'm not sure if I'm explaining this correctly but the point is,  she is not a good dentist whether it is her dentist skills or people skills, she lacks in both.
1 ||| My least favorite airport when flying East. However, if you book with Southwest or US Airways...you'l prolly end up here. I just hate how hard it is to get to the different terminals. On one occasion we really had to haul butt to get to out connecting flight. I guess the only way to avoid this place is book with another airline besides US Airways or Southwest.
3 ||| The bang bang shrimp are great but the prices they charge for everything else are kind of high for the quality. \n\nIt's a nice experience for a night, but I didn't leave there happy about the ratio of quality:price. We had to ask for the bread! I would go to Red Lobster before this place for quantity/quality. You are probably over-paying for the same thing. Grouper are over-fished and shouldn't be eaten in any restaurant!
1 ||| We went there because they were listed as a restaurant with a gluten free menu. But they do not have gluten free menu.  They hand you a Allergen sheet and you have to order your food with modifications, now i have to trust kitchen help not cross contaminate my food.  I have dairy allergy too so I will not be coming back here.  if you need gliuten free do not choose Macaroni grill.
3 ||| This a great Antique store. The prices are a little high, that's why I only gave 4 stars. Has a wide variety and stuff changes out every 5-6 months or so. This place is one of our favorites to go to!
1 ||| I love the food at this place but the service definitely sucks! We got here before a large group came in. We got seated, but the server took orders from the larger group first. Come on, we got here first. We waited for another 10 mins but still nobody came to us. We don't even have anything on our table. The other server didn't even care, he started to clean the other table. We got pissed because we are so hungry and we didn't even got serve at all. We finally left. Now, I don't know if I will come back at this place. But If I do, I want better service.
0 ||| My husband and I decided to eat out last night (which we don't do very often) I didn't write the review last night because I wanted to sleep on it and decide if I really wanted to write it.....\n\nThis experience was the worst I have ever had in a restaurant, ever. \nWe had originally wanted to go to Abuelo's next door, but they had a 45 minute wait. we walked over here to see if they had a wait, it was only 20 minutes so we stayed, unfortunately. We ended up only waiting 10 minutes, this was the highlight of the evening. We were seated upstairs in the back corner, which was nice and secluded, another plus. The hostess did not try to engage in any type of conversation, she showed us the table and started walking away, I had to stop her to ask for a high hair. \nI'm fairly sure our table had not been previously cleaned because we didn't have placemats or silverware like every other table did. Our waitress came by, asked if we wanted drinks and explained how their portions worked. We ordered our drinks, they arrived and then she disappeared for a good 10-15 minutes before coming to get the order. We ordered Mac & cheese for our son, a pasta dish (can't remember the name) and mozz garlic bread. \n\nAbout 10 minutes after we ordered our waitress dropped bread off at the table (which was stale and gross). There was another table that was seated near us a few minutes after we placed our order that also ordered garlic bread and they got theirs the same time we got ours....20 minutes after we ordered it? My sons Mac & cheese came before our bread, that's how long it took. Our waitress kept poking her head around to look at us but never actually said anything. This happened 6-7 times before she finally came over and said \"sorry your entree is taking so long. I rang it in but when I went to the kitchen to check on it and I couldn't find the ticket for it, so they are making it on the fly right now.\" So we waited some more, 50 minutes total from he time we ordered until our entree hit the table. I've waited awhile for food before, it usually doesn't bother me but what really set me off was by the time it finally came it was lukewarm at best! I worked at Yard House so I understand how a busy kitchen works and a check that has been refired should come out extremely hot, not like its been in the window sitting....which is what ours tasted like.\n\nAt this point I am furious and just want the check to come, I had like 2 bites of food before giving up on the whole experience. The manager came over and introduced herself and said \"I'm sorry your dinner took so long, we took it off the check\" and walked away. Didn't give us a chance to explain what happened from our point of view, but whatever we just said thank you. The waitress brought us boxes and could tell there was tension so she said \"sorry about that, at least it makes for a cheap date night.\" I get she was trying to ease tension but it wasn't an appropriate thing to say. I'm pretty sure our waitress just completely forgot to put our order in so she grabbed a dish that had been sitting for a while, because if she truly ordered a new one on the fly it would have came out piping hot. \n\nWe will never ever return here again. Such a disappointing date night.
4 ||| For an Italian-American, I eat a lot of Chinese food.  I always have.  For some reason, my parents and I began eating Chinese food every Saturday night somewhere around 12 years of age and I've kept eating Chinese food at least once a week since then.  \n\nHands down, this is some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten!  And I've eaten Chinese food in Toronto, San Francisco, New York, and Philly - in Little China areas, nonetheless.\n\nWhat makes WanFu the best?  The veggies always seem really fresh and the selection is different than what you'll see anywhere else.  For example, the WonTon soup has some fresh spinach leaves in it.  Have you ever seen that done anywhere?  I haven't, but the flavor it imparts is impeccable.  Vegetable fried rice includes big pieces of fresh red pepper, yellow squash, and asparagus.  And while some of the other dishes can be oversauced, the fried rice has a lot less sauce than any other place...and that allows the incredible flavor of these fresh veggies to glide delectably over your tastebuds.\n\nIt is a little more expensive than your typical Chinese restaurant, but it's worth it!
2 ||| They had some good items like the spicy Korean chicken, seems like everyone likes the Kahlua pig, but they were out when I went.  Big portions!  Everything else was so-so.  Mac salad not so great too salty and peppery - not the island mac salad I'm used to.
4 ||| Best gift store in Charlotte.  Absolutely love this store.  You can find something for everyone on your shopping list!
1 ||| I could literally write a book about Fry's Electronics. This is the one I go to the most since the other Fry's is a million miles away on Baseline Rd past the Arizona Mills mall. I've been here 100 times and there are some key rules when shopping here. \n\nRule#1 Know what you want before you go into the store. Also, know where the hell it is. If you don't know, ask the first customer service person you see. Have them take you to the product. Don't let them wave their hand in the direction they think the product is at. Have them show you, because 9 out 10 times, you won't see it. \n\nRule# 2 Never go to this store on Black Friday unless you want to wait 3-4hrs to reach the cash register. No joke. If you do go, stand in line early at night or morning, so you are one of the top 60-75 person in the line. This way you can get in and out quickly when those doors open.\n\nRule# 3. Never buy refurbished, repriced, restocked items. Half the time they are broken returns that Fry's will try to resell. They don't even test these items. They just rebox them and throw them back on the shelves. Don't even take a chance. It's a waste of your money and your time.\n\nRule# 4 Bring the Fry's Electronics Sales Ad with you if you don't know what you want to buy. It comes out on Friday's in the Arizona Republic. Definitely check it out before you head there if you can. They usually have some decent sales, especially on DVD/Blu-Ray movies, thumb drives, memory cards and video games. The ad is also in the store on the wall to the right after you past the golden metal gates. \n\nNow, here are the pros and cons of Fry's Electronics. \nLet's start with the good stuff.\n\nPros: \n1. The place has everything electronic. I mean EVERYTHING. You got your speakers, phones, computers, laptops, video game consoles, headphones, toasters, refrigerators, vacuums, Blu-Ray players, Media players (IPods), IPod/Tablets, cameras, electronic toys, etc..etc.. It's a grown man's heavenly palace. \n\n2. They usually have great sales on just about everything. too. You can usually get anywhere from 5%-30% on items during their sales. Not bad. \n\n3. They have an online store as well, you can shop online too. www.frys.com Save some gas. \n\n4. They are easy to find, have a huge parking lot and are open every day of the week.\n\nCons:\n1. Their customer service can be the worse ever if you don't know who to talk to. I've been there so often, if I can't find something, I know which rep to find to help me. Very valuble info. These turnaround service reps are hit or miss. Many of them are clueless, but a few of them know the store like the back of their hands. It seems the store filters in new employees in and out almost every 2 months. \n\n2. Dirty, filthy store. I'm not sure who cleans it, but I have only gone into the store maybe twice where the floor was actually clean and sparkling. Other times the place is a mess. Many shelves with either no products on them or products scattered all out of order. Prices labels on shelves not matching products above the labels. Some products opened or have ripped boxes. \n\n3. Long lines. If you go on Friday or during the holidays, be prepared to wait in long lines sometimes. What pisses me off is they will have 2-3 cashiers with about 20 people standing in line waiting. They can't open 2 more registers? You'll see the manager/supervisor just pacing behind the cashiers doing absolutely nothing. \n\n4. Checking your receipts when you leave. I know they do this to try and catch theives who will come into stores with Fry's bags, buy one item and then try to steal a few other small items and sneak by the people checking your receipt. I've seen this happen a couple times. For me, it's just a time waister. Best Buy and Walmart doesn't do this, so why should Fry's? \n\n5. Return policies. They always want you to have your receipt, but why do they open SEALED items when you bring it back with a receipt? They really think people have a plastic packaging system in their homes? I brought back a Blu-Ray movie that was never even opened. Told the guy it was brand new, never opened and he opened it anyways to verify the disk was in it. I brought another one back that was actually missing a disk when I opened it. The guy wondered how that happened. So I told him. Fry's does have a plastic packaging machine in the back. One of their employees opened the Blu-Ray, took out one of the disk and resealed it. Threw it back on the shelf. This guy probably didn't believe me, but he still refunded my money.  \n\nFry's is a decent store to find some good deals. Better then Best Buy overall. Especially for HDTV, speakers and other big products like that. Best Buy overcharges you for everything. Their customer service is just as bad some times. \n\n3 stars - P.O.M. (2/14/2014)
0 ||| I did research the feedback prior to visiting, though a friend at work sang their praises so I went anyway. Out of the three dishes, pork fried rice, twice cooked pork and orange chicken only the fried rice was even barely edible, and just. The twice cooked pork was ghastly, truly the worst I've ever had, greasy to the point of slimey with huge fatty slices more fat than pork with the altogether wrong spice and old veg. The orange chicken was also the worst I've ever had, the sauce was unappealing but it was the meat its self that ruined it utterly, like thawed out class c cuts of something clearly not chicken. the fried rice wasn't so horrible but tasted of  a burnt flavor and the pork in it that would have been fantastic if not for the actual rice that ruined it. My quest for decent Chinese food continues.
0 ||| This review is for the pharmacy. On May 8th I went inside to pickup my prescription. When I get there everything seems good and the pharmacist told me to wait 30 minutes but when I got back he told me he forgot to ask me for one of my numbers. \"FAIL ON YOUR PART FIRST OF ALL\" then tells me the product is backordered. So i wait a few days instead of going the next day (which the guy told me it would be there by May 9th) but I didn't need it at the time and was a little busy so I waited till Tuesday May 13th to go and try to pick it up. You know what they tell me? They tell me that it's still backordered and they have no idea why. WORST SERVICE EVER
0 ||| We have been going to Guedos for years. On a recent visit I think it was our last.The place is filthy. What may have once been shabby chic is now disgusting. Torn burlap hanging from the walls. The food was barely edible. To top things off we had a strawberry drink that was $5!!! each!! The so called service at the register did not bother to inform us of the price.\nLast time try El Sol up the road if you want good food, low rices and a clean place to sit.
4 ||| Giuseppe's is a true gem. Everything on the menu is first rate, but if you don't see what you have a hankering for, the kitchen will occasionally indulge special orders and I've always been very impressed by the plate set before me. The owner is old school good people. Salt of the earth type.  His passion for food permeates the place and you feel better as a person for having gone there.
0 ||| Where to start ? The food is bad and overpriced,, I love pizza and will gladly pay extra for great pie butt. Brixx is not the case!
4 ||| The best Thai in the Phoenix...  This place could hang with the best in the country.  Highly recommend the salad rolls and boat.
3 ||| It is a nice large airport with many amenities while waiting for your flight or to pick someone up
1 ||| Notice how I gave this place 2 stars....It's because their service is pretty much Number 2! They would not put up gutter guards for my sisters, who are not too good at bowling. They have some cranky guy running the only counter and seriously the only upside to this place is the Cosmic Bowling.
3 ||| The Bonanza is an interesting place to shop at.  There is some nice stuff and some overpriced stuff.  I haven't been there in a while so I don't remember much.  All I remember is that it is huge and has a lot of turquoise jewelry and a lot of Southwestern-type stuff.
0 ||| The owner was agitated on arrival,aggressive, rude, i tried to rent a Trailer and a truck to pull it, then he tried to tell me that the truck does not come with a \"ball hitch\" and I would have to buy one at 30-40 dollars including tax additional to all rental costs of both.  I said that this is unreasonable and a \"rip off\" this infuriated the owner (wears Glasses) and shouted i am not in the business of ripping people off and said to go elsewhere........ gladly i did.  Do not do business with this guy....you have been warned......
2 ||| Great chinese food is hard to find... so hard to find, in fact, that most people have never even tasted it.   In the US you can find it in San Francisco, New York, and Boston...  but that's it.   \n\nThe rest of the country will never know GREAT chinese food, but they may be lucky enough to find good chinese food.   The vast majority of Americans will only ever get OKAY chinese food.\n\nP.F. Chang's is better than OKAY and  just shy of being GOOD chinese food, which is why so many people who don't know what good chinese food is get so excited about this place.\n\nP.F. Chang's is basically just a a couple steps up from the Panda Express at your local food court... except it's a lot more expensive.  \n\nThe ONLY thing that stops me from giving P.F. Chang's a lower rating is that they actually make a really fantastic hot and sour soup- which is an incredibly hard thing to find.\n\nThe hot and sour soup is always salty- sometimes too salty... but when they do it just right, it's very delicious.   \n\n*In case you're wondering, there is good chinese food in charlotte... or at least something very close to it.   Look for a little place called Wan-Fu at 10719 Kettering Drive.
0 ||| I hadn't been to Fuddruckers in a year or two...I was so disappointed! \n\nThe good. \nFriendly staff. Clean fixings bar. Updated interior. Cool soda machine. \n\nThe bad. \nThe burger itself seemed colorless grey and super greasy GREASY!  It was like it was precooked, and sat around in a steam table or something...and the bun seemed a little stale...definitely not the fresh baked that I remembered.\n\nThe hotdog was barely warm served on a VERY STALE bun.\n\nThe pico from the fixings bar hat ZERO flavor...it was basically chopped tomatoes and a few little pieces if onion. NO CILANTRO, NO SALT AND PEPPER, BLAND!!!!\n\nThe arcade game (motorcycle one) ate everyone's money. The manager returned our money, but commented that it happens all the time. Awesome. Get it fixed then.\n\nWon't be going back. Red Robin next time!
0 ||| Ate here with a friend because we were starving and it was easy. ...not so fast. The place was filthy, wait staff ignored us for 15 minutes literally...I had to do the \"hey miss can we get some service thing\" when she began helping people that had just sat down.\nThe food wad meh and frankly I couldn't get past the dirt factor. ....tables, floor, etc.  Neither one of us could continue.... her
1 ||| The store was spread out so things were easy to find, but the employees were not that helpful. The store was almost empty and no one asked to help me the entire 30 minutes I was there. I was having problems with printing a baby registry and the 2 employees at the registry desk only assisted after I asked for help, because they were too busy playing on the computer.
1 ||| I happen to like he foo but at this particular location they are so rude! The customer service is non existent. I walked in to an empty place for lunch 20 minutes ago and waited by the register for 10 minutes for someone to help me. 4 employees behind the counter watching one employees show off his spatula skills in the air. No one came over to me to ask \"may I help you\"? Until I started to walk out. Needless to say, I kept walking. They really failed!
4 ||| We have been so impressed with the staff here.  They are always prompt in responding to our service requests.  The two service guys that work here currently are very professional, courteous and knowledgeable.  The office staff are always friendly...and trust me, we have seen some of the worst!  We only have one neighbor that seems to think this is a college apartment (and the staff have been dealing with them), but suffice it to say we really recommend Oakbrook to anyone looking for a great, affordable apartment in the Pineville area.\n\nIt's also really close to 485, so getting to the highway doesn't take much time at all.  It's also really close to good shopping centers.  And to cap off my review, I gotta say how awesome it is to live in a place that is shaded by tons of trees and isolated from the noise of Park and Johnston.
4 ||| We were at Lidia's for an early dinner before seeing a show.  They have a great wine list and our server made some excellent suggestions.  The food was wonderful.  Several of us had the Pasta Trio.  This is a sampler dish with three different pastas prepared and served at your table.  Afterwards, you can get additional servings of your favorite from the Trio.  Of course, none of us even had room for an additional serving.  If you get the Trio, I'd recommend getting the option that includes the salad and dessert.  It's a great deal and you know you'll want it anyway!
1 ||| Got the Doritos supreme tacos and a grilled wrap with a cherry limeade. The tacos were soggy and flavorless because of the sour cream. Next time, no sour cream. Grilled thing was so-so. Cherry limeade was tha bomb.
4 ||| Great pricing on food! A hoagie, fries, & drink is $6 & some change. They have different daily specials for each day of the week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love the buffalo chicken horead agie and chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order a cash fry (chicken, fries and melted mozzarella cheese. You can add veggies for a small price) Also, if they seem full downstairs, the entire 2nd floor is seating. No worries!
4 ||| How have I not reviewed this place yet? This is one of my favorite malls...and I've been to many in my lifetime. \n\nIt's clean, spacious, well lit, and just about every store I want to go to is here. The parking is plentiful with spaces under, multiple garages to the side, or just a large lot by the food court. \n\nEven if I don't have a shopping list in mind, I enjoy window shopping. Love this mall!
1 ||| Institutional food at best. Sevice was great, but not enough to overcome the food quality. This is mac n cheese with powdered cheese, pudding from a can, cheesecake with a slight chemical taste?, etc. Sorry guys, your great but your food is not unfortunately.
0 ||| This is not an outlet store. I mean yeah, they do have a few pairs of cheap shoes but for an outlet store, the prices are not cheap. We went to find an old school addidas jacket for my BF.  The jacket was marked for 39.99. Then we were told that the price was marked incorrectly and the actual price was $75. The original addias price tag was still on the jacket and was marked $59.99. I mean excuse me if I'm wrong but aren't outlets supposed to mark down prices not up? We were told we would be given a deal and they could discount it to $65. Screw that! So not an outlet....and the shoes are ugly
2 ||| Not awful - just not good either.  \n\nStaff was a plus.  I've almost never had a bad experience w/ Hilton staff.  The downside to this stay were thin walls, loud doors and only one elevator working in the main tower section.
4 ||| Their red bean and rice are fabulous and the portion is super generous!  I also had the Kentucky Thoroughbred cocktail and it was amazing.  There's something about sitting knee to knee with strangers at a nine-person diner counter talking about food and life and watching the chef's work in the teensy-tiny kitchen.  But don't worry - if you need some space and want to enjoy the amazing AZ weather there's a HUGE patio and fun little order window... something for everyone!  For dessert I got the homemade biscuit with goat cheese and apple butter.  The biscuit was warm but the cheese was cold and that was a weird combination.  But overall everything was delicious and I will totally be back!!!
3 ||| I like it. I love it. I want some more of it. I've now had two experiences here at Comerica Theatre. Both being great! We arrived via car service both times, so I can't comment on the parking. The theatre is nice. Both times I have had floor level seats about 4-8 rows from stage center. You can see without a problem and the sound and acoustics are amazing. There are screens all around for a closer view. The bartenders are good and bountiful. Not much, if any line, either time I have attended the shows I have seen here. The restrooms are kept clean, that is very important to me, in a place like this that has so many people; trust me, restrooms can get disgusting, fast. On that note, of restrooms, I have not ever stood in line here, either. I also like that no one is allowed to hang out in the concourse areas down to the floor level seats. It bugs me to have to go by people who are using that as their own personal dance hall during a concert when places allow that. Next time, we will try the suite levels. I've heard it's the way to go.
4 ||| I've taken the shuttle for 2 years now, and it's a great way to safely get to and from hohokam.\n\nI had the texas burger, which is a couple onion rings, some green chilli's and cheese.  It was delicious!  Their fries are yum too.  They had a special on bloody mary's.  2.50.  Can't beat that.  Overall, Diamonds is a great little spot, that makes me feel closer to home.
3 ||| I want to say this, I've left Phoenix and since moved. The owners of the liberty market wanted me to come back and they would buy me dinner or whatever would make me happy. They didn't do this to buy my review they did it to correct an error. As a owner of past company I respect the effort that they wanted to do this and I'm changing this to 4 stars for the effort alone. \n\nYes people they do care about their customers.
2 ||| This was our first time here on a Sunday night, and it wasn't very busy but the service was awful! Took forever to be seated, and then our server disappeared for a good while. \nFood was better than expected ( we ordered the steak and it's usually hit or miss here ) but tonight it was better than previous visits.
0 ||| I feel as if nothing here is clean from the food down to the workers.. Not to mention horrible service. But the food was pretty okay tasting.. Or maybe I was just really hungry? Whatever.
1 ||| This place couldn't be more different during the day than at night.\n\nLate night, you can't really beat their food specials, and the service is always excellent on the third shift.\n\nDuring the day and at night however, this place is kind of a drag. They are total nazis about carding people (even those who are obviously 30+) and it gets really annoying. I understand that you can't serve people under 21 but seriously, develop and use some judgment and common sense, and remember your customers, instead of pretending to forget someone. In general, the servers seem intent on finding ways to avoid serving you, rather than trying to help you have a good experience. Perhaps they are so focused on gaming that they view non-gamers as a hassle, if this is the case, they have done a very good job of passively-aggressively making it clear.\n\nThe menu is overpriced and fairly pedestrian, although they do offer really good specials at different times.
0 ||| THe hubby n I went to Vegas and decided it would be a good idea to take a few minutes out of our lives for a simple renewal of vows for our anniversary. We decided on the ever-so-famous Little White Wedding Chapel. \n\nNICKEL AND DIME YOU TO DEATH: They kept charging for everything that was supposed to be included-- Example: We already paid our $200 and something in total, but charged an EXTRA $50 for NOT USING their minister, which is weird since a minister is not required in real life, for anything, ever.  \n\nUNPROFESSIONAL: When it came time to check in naturally they said we owed even more money than that even though I had paid in full. It's interesting because I asked several times for a receipt in the weeks prior so I would NOT have this problem. WHy is it SO hard to email a receipt?! So here I am looking like a cheapskate arguing with an angry, incompetent female who apparently doesn't have shit for math skills and can't get her head out of her ass long enough to explain what the F is going on.\n\nMONEY HUNGRY: They also said they'd record it in case we want to purchase an over-priced DVD, come to find out they never recorded it and gave our friends the run-around. The staff is ridiculous and rude. The organist who didn't even play for us asked my hubby for a tip because she \"doesn't get paid much.\" It's like this: Kiss my ass old woman, the ceremonies last 10 minutes, meaning you get a TIP every ten minutes. You didn't PLAY the organ for us. Of course my hubby tipped her anyway because he's a sweetheart.\n\nUN-SKILLED: If you opt for pics don't expect much. The photographer took every pic straight on. Every angle identical, no rule of thirds, no angle from above, below, or different sides... and forget lighting or anything else that makes a picture unique. (Not that I'm a professional. But I'm also not pretending to be a photographer like this dude.) Good thing we're a \"fun\" group and made the most of our photos. :) At least the photographer was a nice guy.\n\nSO! if you want a bunch of rude, incompetent, no-talent ass clowns you've found your venue.\n\nOn the plus side it's surrounded by porn shops and passed out hookers. Therefore I raise this review from a one-star to a generous 2-star rating.
0 ||| Hands down the WORST service I've ever had today!! A few friends went in after a baby shower to have lunch and not only did the waitress get over half of the orders wrong, she blamed US for ordering wrong! I'm sorry, but I dine out quite frequently and I know how to order. \n\nSo after the waitress had argued with us for the third time, we walked out.  WITHOUT having eaten any food. Now get this, 15 min later the police showed up at my door, with my young son and niece watching, and accused us of stealing alcoholic beverages!!! \n\nOur waitress should know that my husband nor I ordered ANYTHING alcoholic! They threatened to arrest my husband because he didn't know the names of the friends of friends who were there that didn't pay for said alcohol. This is absurd! And embarrassing when my neighbors are inquiring as to why the police are at my home! \n\nSave yourself some grief and skip this place!!!! Valle Luna is just down the street & their food is amazing!!
4 ||| This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in this area of town. I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed. \n\nIf you're looking for an amazing location/view/atmosphere, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're looking for amazing food, then you've come to the right place. \n\nThe prices are great for what you get. The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite!
1 ||| To be fair, I only went here once a few months ago. It was a Wednesday and not a busy night.  It's near where I live so I was hoping it would be good.  I will have to try it again, but it's difficult to try a place again and possibly have another bad experience when we have so many good places so I will likely wait until soemone I know recommends it.\nService was poor.  Took over ten minutes to be greeted while staff chatted at bar and kept going to karaoke area.  Was not asked about refill when water and beer were out.  Food (noodle bowl with veggies) was greasy (not in a good way), salty (not in a good way) and bland otherwise. Area behind the bar was less than clean. \nI walk by often and do not see many customers, even college kids, so I suspect they still need to get their act together.  Hope they do.  Great location.
2 ||| Every time I've wanted to come here the line is always out the door and I never felt like waiting. Since I had the day off today my sister and I went to go try it out. The restaurant is small and you seat yourself as you walk in. Thankfully there was no wait today so we were able to sit down right away. I got the avocado, tomato and bacon omelet and my sister got the French toast with eggs and bacon. The portion size were generous , food tasted good and the service was good. However I don't think it's the best breakfast I've ever had and I'm a bit disappointed. Since there are always people waiting out the door , I had high hopes and was expecting the food to be amazing.
1 ||| Yes, I am ruining The Artisan. Let me start by saying I have celebrated several birthdays over the years here and encouraged others. I have stayed in the rooms, dined here in the past and all I can say about it now is G-H-E-T-T-O. Not to be confused with ghetto fabulous either. \n\nThe two stars is for the actual building and lighting and beautiful Gothic, eclectic decor and artwork making Artisan unique to others. The djs get a huge fist pound as well for spinning sick beats and being the only cool people left in the building. Now on to the huge three throbbing stars they will never see again. \n\nOn my last visit it was a gorgeous night out and they had opened the patio. I venture out there thinking it would be a chic, chill place to listen to good music and have cocktails with friends. NOT. They were playing Justin Bieber through the sound system! Ugh. This is not Chuck E Cheese, people!!!! Secondly, if there was a waitress outside she was no where to be seen and I waited for over 30 minutes. Now to touch on the service. The Artisan use to have the most beautiful bartenders and cocktail waitresses in town. All with smiling faces and quick drinks just as you ordered them. The past two visits I made were for the after hours and I must say the waitresses all looked odd to me and not in a good way. One female looked sickly thin in her corset that appeared four sizes too large for her. The hair and makeup were not put together at all and she seemed on the verge of tears, too. The other looked completely TRASHED drunk and was slurring when getting our drink orders. When she stumbled back to bring our drinks they were all wrong times two rounds. Ugh. I don't know if she was bloated from all the alcohol she had been drinking, but her corset was ripping on the seams a bit! At least her blonde hair was \"did\" and she had glittery rave makeup on. I felt the service looked unprofessional and was unprofessional and both waitresses need interventions ASAP. \n\nThis use to be the classy after hours all of the dancers from the shows and trendy locals would go to hide from the big clubs and enjoy drinks and friends in an upscale lounge. Now it appears like trash to me. If the staff is allowed to drink or not they should still be able to take drink orders and look professional. This place is a gem to Vegas and just isn't shining like it use to....... Work it out Artisan.
4 ||| Five stars for the breakfast skillets. The one with bacon/sausage/eggs is delicious and the best of its kind that I've had anywhere.\n\nThe place is in one of the oldest buildings in downtown Gilbert, with adobe walls that lean 5-10 degrees but have not fallen down.
3 ||| Super helpful staff which is knowledgeable about their products and can offer advice on how to use ingredients. \n\nThey stock a lot of spices and rices. You can also pick up specialty ingredients such as tamarind and Indian desserts. Kohli also sells some hot foods to go such as samosas.
4 ||| This place was pretty good someone took me here a long time ago and I could never remember the name and I just found it. The neighborhood is not so nice But I guess don't let that run you away Have to try new things!!
4 ||| I wanted flowers for my wife's birthday delivered to the restaurant where we were meeting family for her birthday dinner. Unfortunately, I forgot to take care of it until the day of. I called Terri at 11:30am with a specific arrangement in mind, and I needed it delivered by 4:30pm! I was fully prepared for her either to say she couldn't help me or that I would have to pick another arrangement that was premade...\n\nTerri was EXTREMELY accommodating. She didn't actually have the flowers for the arrangement I wanted, so she recommended a way that she could still make the arrangement but substitute different flowers. This was an awesome idea, but the missing flowers were actually our wedding flowers. While I was hemming and hawing and trying to decide what to do, Terri piped up with \"you know what, one of my drivers is near the flower supplier. Let me call him and have him stop in for some Asiatic lilies for you.\" Wow! Extremely customized service and meeting an insane deadline.\n\nSo, that's the customer service. On to the flowers themselves. This is the most beautiful arrangement I have seen in a long time. My wife was floored, and everyone who has seen the arrangement has raved about it. \n\nI think we've officially found our \"florist we'll use for everything in our family.\" There is literally not a single thing about this experience I could have asked to go any better.
4 ||| It's fashionable for students to knock the free university health center.  I don't know, walk-in visits, nurse practitioners with years of experience, a free pharmacy, free health classes, free physician care, labs, blood pressure checks, gynecological care, condoms etc., etc. sound like a good deal to me.  Maybe I'm wrong.  If the health clinic cannot handle the medical need, they refer to specialists in the community, so I can't go with the slander that they mistreat students.  Plus the facility is clean and modern, and most can walk to it.
0 ||| My husband and I came to Luv-It as part of our \"Downtown Day\" on our 5 day trip to LV (from San Diego)... We didn't realize it was closer to the northern end of the strip than the Fremont Experience - which we feel is a rather seedy area... \n\nWith all of the rave reviews on Yelp, I was expecting some kind of line - especially on a Friday afternoon - but there wasn't anyone there but 2-3 people that were running the place. This didn't help, as I already felt very uncomfortable being in that area. Having several other patrons around would have made me feel more at ease. I was disappointed in how run down and tired the exterior looks, but tried telling myself that some of the best places are rough around the edges. \n\nThere were a lot of flavors listed, so we asked what the recommended (the Western). Now, I've never had frozen custard, so I don't really know what to expect, per se. With that said, I was underwhelmed. We got the large size, which barely came up to the rim. The custard was half melted... (I was expecting it to be more firm - or cold enough, at least, to hold it's shape). Flavor-wise... Meh. It felt like a budget sundae - like something you would get at Hometown Buffet or Sizzler. I would have been more satisfied with something from Cold Stone, Baskin Robins, or Yogurtland. \n\nAs soon as my husband and I turned to leave the window with our custard, we were approached by a homeless man that was very adamant that we help him out and give him $5. Looking around, I noticed a few more hanging around the lot. I do not come to LV to be badgered and hustled by homeless people. I am here to enjoy some overdue, well-earned vacation time! Staff was hands-off with the situation, even though it was only 5 or so feet away from their service window. \n\nBetween the disappointment in the product, the sketchy location, the lack of other patrons, and the number of homeless people lurking about, we won't be back or be recommending it to anyone. We couldn't get out of there quick enough. Sorry, Luv-It, but we'd rather Leave It!
4 ||| I have been going here for too many years to count, and it is hands down the most authentic Japanese restaurant that exsists here. This is not American Style Japanese this is REAL YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD!
3 ||| Lately I find my tastes changing. These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.\n\nOne of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall \"character\" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.\n\nThis was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.\n\nKen and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a \"lil\" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the \"70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!\n\nI have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.
0 ||| I've avoided Wal-Marts in big cities for years. Life is too short. But WM seems to be trying to upgrade its image, its stores, and the quality of the fresh foods in their Supercenters. So I gave this one a try. I got three or four items from the produce center (it was actually quite impressive), and headed to the 12 items or less lane. There were maybe a dozen people in that line in front of me. Sigh. Oh well.\n\nSo I stand there - checking my iPhone email - and it slowly dawns on me that someone is yelling. So I look up and I see the cashier of this line - a grizzled old lady shaking her bony finger - is screaming for me to get out of her line because she'd turned her light off. No joke - screaming! It took me a good five or six seconds to truly realize that this was actually happening, and happening to me. So I yelled back that someone as old as her should have better manners, that her light was on when I got in line, and that she should feel free to proceed straight to hell. I dropped my produce on the floor and walked straight out the door. Never again...
0 ||| Ordered food around 8:00 now it's around   11:30, called twice but no answer- weird for a restaurant that is open until 1:30 A.M and has already charged my credit card. When I finally got my food it was cold and sucked- I'm not a food snob either (papa John or dominos delivery pizza is fine by me). The pizza was awful, wings were soggy, and mozzarella sticks were cold on the inside. If you're looking for good service and food aim elsewhere this place was awful- bad enough for me to take the time to download this app, and make a review..
4 ||| Legends is a University of Illinois favorite for watching football games and grabbing a beer. While watching a game and enjoying a brew bar food is always great to tame your appetite. \n\nThe cheeseburger at Legends is a typical bar-style burger. Featuring a sesame bun, a thin patty, and topped with the works. The classic flavors are all their with the burger at Legend's, however nothing is necessarily exceptional. The bun, beef, and topping could all bring more to the table. \n\nIt is not the best burger in Champaign, but Legends is definitely one of the best places to watch a game. The burger will satisfy you if you have a craving while enjoying a night with friends.
1 ||| Usually I love me some LGO but today I received the worst service I have had in a long time. I took some new Lgo-ers here after convincing them that they have the best salads and nice friendly staff. To begin...the cashier was very rude when one of the salads was asked to be made without cheese. Then after waiting over 25 minutes for our 3 salads there were no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long. The worst part of it all is when we complained about the wait, the manager was standing right there and said nothing!
2 ||| Went there last night with 8 peeople. There was another 14 people party.\n\nThe food was good -- not great but good. We waited 45 minutes for the first dish to arrive and that only because we sent one of our folk to see what was going on. \n\nThey did bring drinks and tea promptly.
3 ||| The food here is pretty good.  Comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  The lamb is definitely good.  And it is definitely a good date restaurant.  I would rather give it 3.5 stars since I've definitely eaten at better restaurants. But for Pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up.
0 ||| A big fat FAIL to this Schlotzsky's location!!!! .\nI went to order something for my office and did so online. but for some reason the company they use for group orders some how some way got messed up. so Schlotzsy's never had my order. So after almost an hour of waiting I  called them and they  didn't even have my order. so they took it and an hour later we got the food. Then the next day I get a phone call saying i did something wrong and could i fix it so they can get there money. So i tried and it kept  kicking me  for some reason so now not only do they want there money they wont me to take time out of my work day to come down and pay for it at the store. Really!?!  I tell you customer care and service right out the window. I will never ever order from this location again!
0 ||| Terrible customer service. Especially Irene? I won't waste my time going back again.
3 ||| This little beauty supply store is great and cheap.  I usually just buy my hair dye here and it's only about $4.00.  I bought the  Sally's card too for $5.00 a year which isn't too bad cause you're given some coupons as well as discounts.
3 ||| I can not compare this place to anywhere, because no place else compares, including some pretty awesome places in Miami. First of all, how cute are the owners? They remind me of my grandma and grandpa in laws. I had 3 different empanadas and each one was amazing. They were all totally different, including the types of dough, and there is no way I could ever pick a favorite. One was the Queen Arepa, one was just a chicken and cheese, and one was the empanada de verde, my FAVORITE. Can I also just say my picky 7 year old loved each and every thing we got? We also got 3 different kinds of tamales, I dont remember which kinds, due to the food coma I was going into but I remember happiness when I ate them! (One was red, one was green, one was Equadorian, I think) Ok so, for dinner, I got the Bandeja Paisa, which seriously, Im not even sure what was going on there, but it was incredible, meat and I think a sweet plantain and sweet sauce and just some good, Total comfort food. Oh yea and there was an egg. I like anything topped with an egg. Hubby got his all time favorite, his mom is Peruvian and he grew up in Miami, so he knows his stuff...anyways, he got the lomo saltado and said it was amazing! We got the coconut flan for dessert, good but Ill try something else next time, although Im not really in it for dessert! The best way to describe it is comfort food, not mashed potato or mac and cheese comfort, way better. And there is just so much to pick from, it's going to take a lot of visits to get through that menu. Im up to the challenge! Oh and by the way, I did take out, it is such a tiny little place, I think it would be a pain in the ass to eat there during any kind of meal time, I went at 430 and got take out for dinner, no one was there yet. I think I'll stick with the take out plan due to how small it is and the fact that the food takes so long since its all homemade and Im sure that makes the wait time for a table pretty intense....
2 ||| This was my 3rd time here. Another food trip inspired by a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate.\n\nWe arrived at 7pm Friday night and the parking lot was fairly full but once we entered the dining room was empty-everyone was in the bar.\n\nWe asked to sit upstairs in the game room and it was empty to. We had it all to ourselves....or so we thought.\n\nThey have 2 pool tables,fooseball,pinball, racing,hunting and a jukebox plus a big screen with 3 couches to lounge and a 100\"+ projection screen for events,etc.\n\nThere's also a small bar upstairs but the waitresses do have to run up & down the stairs for soft drinks & food.\n\nWe ordered drinks & some cheeseburger sliders for an appetizer. Then we all ordered sandwiches and a steak.\n\nMy son got the Teriyaki Swiss burger with fries, my wife got the Turkey Bacon Club and I got the  Mustang Melt-an 8oz New York with bleu cheese and bacon bits.\n\nBefore the food arrived a group of 10-12 kids and their parents arrived to add some life to the place. The kids were all well-behaved and excitedly enjoying all the games.\n\nThe service was great, the food however was just ok. The hamburger taste like frozen patties flavorless & dry -not at all good. The turkey club was great and the steak was enjoyable but the bleu cheese & bacon wasn't necessary the steak would have been better without it.\n\nI was a little disappointed they didn't have the california-style  tuna melt that used to be on the menu (http://www.menusearch.net/lasvegas/restaurant.php?name=570)\n\nI will buy another GC @ restaurant.com but I will stay away from the burgers and stick to the pork tenderloin.
4 ||| This is my go to spot when im craving PHO', its just so good:]\nThey have a good range of pho soups and they have the other rice and vermicelli dishes/bowls.  Really tasty. Great egg rolls! Service is fast as long as its not completely packed and the servers are pretty nice. Just dont get the thai tea because it will be a disappointment!! I ordered it and it came in this tiny plastic cup instead of the tall cup in the picture! soo not worth the 3 and sumtin dollars.\n\ni would have to agree about the msg with one of the yelpers though, some but NOT all of their soups have extremely high amounts of MSG, the egg noodle soups i think/soups other than the traditional pho soup, i had one and oh myyyy never ordered that again!\n\n But overall i would recommend this place, if your looking for authentic Pho go here instead of \"pho kim long\"!
4 ||| Delicious Korean bbq dishes, perfectly cooked with a deep smokey flavor in each bbq bite.  They also have good seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) and decent tofu soups.
4 ||| Great place. I take my car there for everything. Inexpensive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They've fixed my tire, taped a broken hose temporarily, and done other things for no charge several times. I'd definitely recommend them.
3 ||| The Sicilian crust is the best I've had West of Ohio. Just amazing. They offered a GF option which was also nice. Toppings skimpy so that's why I didn't give this 5 stars. Service quite pleasant. Suggestion to owner: would love fresh mushrooms vs canned.
0 ||| Dr. Lykins was great...but the office staff was horrible!  \n\nHe saw my two kids (2 and 4) to have tubes removed.  Not sure why I had to come back for the second appointment, but I think it was a $$ thing...anyway, suppose to have surgery in two days and I canceled both!   The office insisted that I had to pay before the surgery (to the tune of $35)...but they hadn't billed for the kids last appointment.  If they had we would be at our deductible and owe NOTHING!  The lady argued with me about it...I was so upset, I have another appointment for the kids on Monday with another ENT to have their tubes out...what a circus!
2 ||| I have acquired a very nice piece of Furniture. \"American Drew\"\nAs I have read the other yelper's post/review, I agree.\nI will explain to you, the dialogue of the encounter with http://www.establishedbuyers.com/\n\nI called the number on the site and was re- directed to a Field rep who apparently has been with this company for some time. Unknown? After have spoke to him and Emailing him 3 pics--(which you will See here) and a link to my CL posting   ---http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/fuo/4670398140.html---( this is not an attempt to sell--only so that you can see the pics I have poste--he offered me a 50$ deal.   \n\nReally? Note this on their site??\n\nSince 1958 we have been paying TOP DOLLAR \nfor clean quality home furnishings!\n\nI replied with Id rather burn it than sell it for that. He replied - ive heard that before. I then came back with - If your not interested--you should have just said so. So on and So forth. The texting continued by me stating he need not reply and good bye. He then came back with -And I quote. \"You should educate yourself before speaking\" . \nThe next call was then back to the number posted on the site. The lady who answered the phone sounds like she's the owner of the business and that the field rep works for her. She stated that he is very good at what he does. That buy the conversation \"we\" had--she would offer 50$ as well.  Why?? She NEVER even seen the 2 piece Dresser/Hutch \"American Drew furniture. I did come back with \" That the piece is worth far more than $50.00. I could get more off donating it - with the tax write off. - she stated that that it would be worth it seeing how I was trying to get \"RID\" of it. (note) Im not trying to \" get rid of IT\" im trying to sell it. NOTE: the headline on her --web site---Since 1958 we have been paying TOP DOLLAR \nfor clean quality home furnishings!\n\n\nThe point is--do your research first and don't jump into a sale with these people. In the long run - your furniture may be worth more to you in the form of a donation or a gift to someone who could use your no longer wanted items. They remind me of a pawn shop and the prices they offer. \nSeller Beware?
1 ||| Two things Mineo's taught me:\n1) There is such thing as too much cheese.\n2) Some pizza slices really do need to be blotted.  Normally, I roll my eyes when people blot their pizza--what's pizza without some grease?--but Mineo's slices are an exception. \n\nThe sauce here is pretty good, but as is the case with the cheese, there's too much of it.  I've burned my finger holding down the cheese as I bite into my slice so I don't end up pulling off all of it.  I thought the crust leaned towards being a little too crispy.\n\nI like the paneled walls and the framed photos--check out the Life magazine cover of young Molly Ringwald.  But I don't come to a pizza place for ambiance, so it's not enough to keep me from looking at other places for a superior slice.
1 ||| Seriously...you are just better off going to Wendy's or Whataburger down the street and sitting inside if you want a burger...their burgers are better, their service is faster, the bill is cheaper.  \n\nMy hamburger last night was clearly two frozen patties grilled with toppings. I make these at home or on weekends all the time. \n\nThe value for quality isn't there.
4 ||| I totally love Hamburger Works. They have the best wings in town. Beware of the Hot, though, they'll kick your butt. Order them crispy and enjoy. The burgers are so-so, not the greatest, but still good. They have a small salad bar, so you can either get a salad, or load your burger up with whatever goodness you want. They have a rather large menu, mostly burgers and sandwiches, accompanied by the typical fried appetizer type foods - think mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini and mushrooms, chili cheese fries, the whole bit. \n\nService is a little slow, but nice because you know you're not exactly eating \"fast food\". There are plenty of tables for parties of different sizes, and there's a bar, too. I have to admit, it's a little pricey for how dive-y it is, but it's worth it.
3 ||| Always low prices! \n\nClean floor. Clean staff. \n\nYou just gotta love Wallyworld! \n\nI mean.. past the political stuff :)
4 ||| Trader Joe's are great. I remember seeing them everywhere on the east coast. \n\nThis particular Trader Joe's is one of the smallest ones I have been in, but it still carries tons of great stuff at Trader Joe's prices. \n\nCan't beat Trader Joe's 1 Buck Chuck wine.
1 ||| Don't waste your time trying to find this hidden store.  overpriced dated clothing.  The handbags looked to be about the most interesting thing in the store.  Goodwill would have a better selection  and condition clothes.
0 ||| Parents, be aware of JSM.  After my daughter spent a difficult year of slow repairs, a cracked window in the dead of winter, dirt and noise, your security deposit will come back with a lot of over-stated charges.  Even though the apartment was dirty at move-in (broken glass in the kitchen, desk drawers still filled with items,etc.) the move-out charges included $275.00 for general cleaning, $145.00 for alleged carpet cleaning (again, we found dirty carpet at move in) and a $60.00 maintenance charge to change the lock on the front door.   I'm sure they paid someone way less than $275.00 to clean an empty apartment!  Contrast with Tower at 3rd for a $40.00 move-out carpet cleaning.
2 ||| Way too overpriced and nothing special with the atomosphire. Foods are Okey and presentation is good but nothing authentic by any means.
1 ||| The menu keeps getting smaller, the prices keep getting higher, and the service hasn't gotten any better. \n\nWe called ahead for 11am and walked in at 1050. They didn't seat us until 1120 and we didn't see a waitress for a little over 10 minutes and we ordered right away for fear we wouldn't see her again in a while. \n\nFood was good but took 40 minutes to come out. Overall not impressed.
4 ||| IPA lovers, this is your destination in the desert.\n\nI regret that I live 10 miles away, and there is no way I'll even stop in for 1 Tropper IPA (1 is impossible) and then get in my car and drive. \n\nBut the balance is perfect: a hearty body with some bite, not overbearing on the malt, hops are strong but balanced with some fruity, floral bouquet that lingers on the tongue. And it's not too cold either, like some of the other breweries. I can't speak for the other beers, but I've tried every IPA in the area, this is the best!\n\nI still wish I could find 3 Floyd's on tap out here. Maybe even Crooked Tree IPA- those are still my favorites, but this will do.
4 ||| In one word, FANTASTIC.\n\nOne of Madison's better restaurants in the Tribeca area (I still LAUGH OUT LOUD at Madison's attempt to be tres cool and call their TRIangle BEhind the CApitol Tribeca, but hell... I'll go along with it).  The decor is very \"cove-esque\", exposed brick, old paintings.  The dining area is a wee bit small, and sometimes the dances that the wait staff have to do in order to get us the delicious appetizers is quite uncanny, but my GOD, the bread is scrumptious, their seasonal soup and salad is ALWAYS a hit, and it's the only place yet that I've eaten okra and loved it.  OKRA I TELL YOU.. YES.. en par with Brussell sprouts, but it's fantastic.  For meat eaters (this IS an Argentinian restaurant) evidently the meat selection is good... This veg head wouldn't know... All I DO know is that everytime work takes me out here for a dinner, I never miss the opportunity... he he..\n\nAlso, their lounge always features great music, and paired with a Kir Royale and a cheese platter, you can make sure your night will be \"Inolvidable\"...
2 ||| Salon: My star rating was based on the salon\nMy friend had a gift card for the Four Seasons so during our trip to Scottsdale, we decided to use it at the Salon to get our nails done. We got an appointment on Saturday morning, I called beforehand to make sure they have gel/shellac manicures available. I sat in a weak massage chair, but enjoyed the warm neck pillow she placed around me. I asked if she could do a french manicure and she hesitated but said yes. As she was putting my hands in the UV, I noticed that the white polish was starting to bubble at the tips, I pointed it out to her and she said that's happened before, I assume its because there was air flowing through the UV lamps, which I've never experienced before. \nOnce the last coat was on and under the light, it was time for the salt scrub. I was excited at the thought that I would get my hands and arms scrubbed, but disappointed when she asked me to do it myself and then she spent about 30 seconds rubbing my hands. No lotion, no massage, nothing. My friend was still getting her nails done so I left to go use the sauna. ONE DAY LATER, my at least $105 manicure (It was $85 for the gel and another $20 for the french!!) started PEELING UP!!! It's now been 4 days and I've had 4 fingers start peeling and was able to just peel the entire gel polish. I pay $40 in Santa Barbara and it lasts up to 3 weeks! For paying over $100, this manicure was worthless. \n\nPool: \nMy friend and I mentioned to our manicurists about wanting to go to the pool there and they said that we couldn't because the pool was only open to spa guests. We were disappointed as we wanted to spend the afternoon there and thought the salon counted. We went into the well stocked locker room and changed into our suits anyways and went to check it out. Whoa! We walked right in without needing a key card. No one asked us anything as we found a couple lounge chairs and laid out. The friendly poolside staff, brought us a pitcher of water and towels. We ordered lunch a couple hours later, and when they asked our room number, we told him we were guests of the spa and were going to pay cash. We had the chicken panini and jalapeno hummus. They were both great! Throughout the afternoon the poolside staff brought treats for everyone including rice crispy treats, dibs ice cream and otter pops! Perfect things for a hot day.
4 ||| I have been going here for years.  The place is tucked in next to Wildflower Bread Company in the Sonoran Shopping center.  The place is spotlessly clean, the people are friendly and pleasant and they are always willing to accommodate me.  The tubs for pedicures has a disposable liner for each appointment and the instruments used are in a sealed sterile bag for each client.  Prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend this salon.
3 ||| Just like any other take out chinese place.  Super quick, laden with msg and cheap!  \nWe got some take out and it didn't fail.  The tofu and veggies was cooked very well and I had a spring roll which didn't not fail me in my hour of need.\n\nOne fail on their part was that they forgot my rice, which I was somewhat looking forward to, but can't complain all that much.  \n\nFrom the time we called in our order and left shortly after our food was made.  For two people, we paid 17 bucks and got 3 courses, so I was pleased enough... rice or no rice!
4 ||| Fantastic! We tried this place based on yelp and tripadvisor reviews and all the great reviews were right!\n\nThe service is outstanding and the food is awesome. We will be back:-)
4 ||| AHHHHMAZING!  That sums it up!\n\nAbsolutely wonderful resort ... the service at the residence club is outstanding.  They sure do make you feel pampered and welcome, and go out of their way to ensure you are happy.  The grounds are beautiful, so well kept .. so peacful and a perfect way to de-stress and get rejuvinated!  \n\nThe food (and service) at Ocotill Grill at residence club pool is outstanding.  Fish tacos and the shrimp salad are out of this world.  And the agave mojito is a must.\n\nThank you to all at Four Seasons for making this a superb stay.  I can't wait to come back.
4 ||| This was a great 1st experience at this sushi restaurant.  All of the sushi exceeded my expectations.  I will definitely be back for more. The Murphy roll is a must!!
4 ||| Cathy O. at the ticket counter, PHX airport, was very helpful.  She saved me from what could have been a disastrous day.  I know the entire ticketing process should be automated.  Usually the process is flawless.  She had to do a lot of research with my botched listing.  Thank you Cathy O.; you are awesome.
4 ||| A rare authentic gem in Phoenix. This is the best french bakery / bistro in the Valley. The owner is from Lyon and has been here with his family for 10 years or so. His french pastry chef is extraordinary. Very unique find - imported directly from France as well. He's probably 80 and has prefected so many of his recipes. All of the pastries here are truly awesome.\n\nI haven't eaten here for lunch. But, the after dinner or before movie treats here are very good.
4 ||| Wow, these guys had the truck I needed, explained everything and were extremely pleasant to deal with.  In addition, they helped me calculate the costs of my next move.  Efficient, friendly, helpful guys.  Great to deal with at a stressful time.
1 ||| Came in tonight on our way home and hoping for pizza, which we saw on the online menu. However,  when we asked for a menu, our bartender, poor guy, had to jot down the limited menu options on a beverage napkin because they do not provide him a printed late night menu. I can say as a fellow bartender, how can you possibly expect your staff to give great service if they don't have the basic tools to do the job?? He did a great job, all things considered but I don't know that I would comes back here to eat late night again. The bartender is awesome, but should at least have something printed to present for a menu. I would come back to see him for drinks,  but that's prob it. Give your staff a little support and they can do a much better job for you.
0 ||| Went here friday night for dinner with hubby. We had not been here for a few years and we were excited to try it again. We wanted to love it... But found everything to be just ok... Kinda disappointing. Service was slow, even though it was not that busy (our first clue we \nProbably picked the wrong place to eat). The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old (even in las vega summers) but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed ( forgot to ask for dressing on the side), soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant (would never have occurred to me!). When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were 4 small cubes of chicken,6 small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about 4 cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when it's late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back... Even for free meal!
4 ||| No trip to Phoenix is complete without at least one visit to LGO.  The Spanish Latte is now the Havana Latte, but I'm protesting and still ordering the Spanish...just to show them that I've been around since the beginning.  I'm an ol' time LGO'er.  \n\nThe menu has been expanded a little and I'm ok with that.  Service seems to have picked up a little in the speed department, which is good.  \n\nI'll probably be back one more time before I head to the airport back to Chicago.
4 ||| I really liked Dave & Andy's. Among the places I've had ice cream, Dave & Andy's is one of the best. It's fresh, well-made, and pretty cheap. It blows places like Cold Stone or Ben and Jerry's out of the park. They offer a wide assortment of unique flavors, and every one of them tastes superb. I've been to a lot of ice cream stores/creameries, and Dave & Andy's ranks among my top choices anywhere.
0 ||| This review is for the Travel Agency department. \nI went to ask for information about a possible trip I was planning.\nMy agent was all business and NO friendliness. NONE. She hardly even made eye contact after she kept me waiting 10 minutes after our appointment. I told her what I was looking for, she called someone, (I have no idea who), gave me the prices the other person quoted her. Then said if I had any other questions, that I would have to contact a fellow AAA agent because she was going to Australia and would be unavailable. When I asked for a copy of her notes, she seemed bothered. I guess I was expected to memorize the quotes she had given me. Needless to say--- I WON'T be booking with AAA travel any time in the future.
4 ||| My boyfriend had acquired a second hand air compressor for his airbrush at an excellent deal, but the poor thing was in wretched shape when he got it. We decided it was worth investing in repairing it because it was still much cheaper than buying one new, so this is where we brought it. There's a small area to the side where they can handle repairs such as these, and we left the compressor with them for a month or so while they acquired all the necessary parts and worked their magic. \n\nThey were very communicative along the way, calling and letting us know what parts they needed, the costs of each and our options, as well as an explanation as to why there may be any delay. In the end, the compressor now works very smoothly and we only invested about $300-400. Considering the condition it was in, we were pretty satisfied.\n\nThey have a decent selection of other art supplies, from various papers, canvas and sketchpads to an array of markers, pens, pencils and other goodies for your creative endeavors. There's a section with books and guides. They display pieces from local artists and presumably customers.  A cool little shop in a more 'eclectic' area of town! Closer than Dick Blick's and quite a bit more personable.
2 ||| I have heard great things about Flo's restaurants, so imagine the excitement I felt when I saw Flo's Asian Kitchen across the shopping center at dinner time!  \n\nWe decided to check it out and, to sum it all up, the service was fantastic, but the food was a bit of a let down.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't find any of the dishes to be anything more than average.  The sauce with the crispy & spicy chicken was salty and lacked any real heat.  The chicken itself was prepared fine, but it was not unlike any other chicken breast that has been pounded, breaded in panko and fried.  The green curry was good, but I there was not enough coconut milk in the recipe and the dish was very heavy on the onion.  I also wished there was more of the green curry sauce....lots more.\n\nThe service is what redeemed this visit.  We were greeted and then seated immediately after we entered the establishment.  Waters were brought to us with out having to ask, including a small cup with a lid for our daughter.  Our server was completely on the ball with taking orders, refilling drinks and checking back with us to make sure we were taken care of.  The service she provided was good enough that I might be willing to give Flo's Asian Kitchen another go....maybe.
3 ||| Really nice attendant. She was such a doll. Bonus - They don't charge to try on wigs! Found two great wigs for under $70 (total charge). \n\nLots of trashy looking isles in here, but it's a beauty supply store ;) -1 star for the awkward lines at the front desk.
1 ||| PART ONE: As of now I will say I give it two stars this is a on going review so have a seat. This is gonna take a while!\nI went in store last Thursday with the husband. He asks to see home movie chairs the staff member told us his name is Danny and we can follow him. We follow him to the back of the store where he tells us I will show u online...blah blah blah.... So I ask excuse me are the chairs in store? Well no they are not. Well, allow me to ask you why you walked us to the back of the store if you have nothing to showcase in person. Well if you shut up and let me talk...I looked at my husband then looked at Danny. Then I had to ask my husband did he say if I shut up...Ok that is disrespectful so I took my husband by the hand and walked away. I walked up to the front where other staff are sitting on chairs like they at home just relaxing doing nothing on the clock...just looking stupid. Excuse me who is the manager? Oh is something wrong yes it is I tell him what just happen...Im Rodney he says and I will be more than happy to help you guys out. Wonderful I say. Now the other staff named Danny runs up and stands next to Rodney and yells he going to tell you the same thing I told you. blah blah blah just yelling and he is not in control of his feelings almost as if he needs some meds to relax him. I told him after his very unprofessional rant...Look Danny is it? You can just excuse yourself because I wont be doing business of any kind with you. Please know that I am a adult and I don't show child like behavior and I never throw temper tantrums of any kind...With that being said I don't talk to other adults who showcase child like behavior and throw temper tantrums. You had your strike one when you told me to shut up. And Im willing to write it off with your having a bad day but if you don't get out of my face Your going to find yourself having the worst day of your life. The husband decides to step up and when he talks I just decide to say NOTHING else. I was very angry at this point I cant tell you what the husband said to the young minded Danny but we walked off with Rodney who walked us all over the store and I picked out this and that and decided to return the following day. I like Rodney he's professional, funny and knows a lot about what I like. Everything he showed us made the husband know he would be spending his money here.  \nPART TWO:\nUpon Friday we went to a few other stores. And I told the husband I liked that stuff I seen at Ashleys so lets go back. He was a little worried about the Danny guy but as I told him...I'm busy nesting in our new home. And that's what I have him for to protect me and if I want something and its in his reach he should make it happen for me.\n The husband wanted to know if I wanted to visit a different location. My answer was NO because I seen what I wanted and I was going back for it. Now the Danny guy wont be a issue for me because I'm going to see Mr. Rodney and to me Danny is nothing but a on looker at this point. \nSo once inside the store Danny is standing doing nothing. I speak to all the staff in my pure southern down home voice. Hey how yall doing today? One Staff stood up very quickly and said in a shake E voice Good afternoon your here to see Rodney? I will page him for you. i smiled and said yes...Thank you and I walked off...into the store and started to point at things and the husband took pictures so he could do all the talking to Rodney I can only assume.\n Rodney came a few moments later. Oh your back Derrick and what was your name again? I smiled and said my name is Money leaving out the door because you cant recall my name. lol  It's Samantha and I shook his hand. The husband looked at his phone and told Rodney what I wanted and soon paperwork was given to us to sign.\n One chair I picked out I wanted pillows to match and the 2nd problem began. Rodney said sure we can do that for you. You can get the chair and order the pillows that u want. But the lady in the back office was moody and just mean. Ugh if that chair was not so cute at this point I swear I would leave and never come back. They stood right in front of us and had a convo about us. Why would Rodney allow them to special order a chair and pillows blah blah blah this will mess the system up blah blah blah. \nNow yes I want to leave but I want what I want and no one will keep me from it. So they decide well if they want it let them do the foot work. I told the husband foot work is ok God helps those who help themself. So the old grumpy lady hands me a paper with a number she says call this number order this with this number and come back tomorrow and pay here. I reply yes Maam. Now I wanted to say to her aint that your job? But its ok I am not to proud to make a few phone calls in order to have what I want. As we leave the store I tell Rodney I will see him tomorrow. And thank you so much for all your Help. He was like Im just glad I saved you as a customer.
0 ||| Ordered delivery for the first and last time. Although delivery was prompt and driver pleasant the food in taste was poor. Although the lady I ordered from told me the egg rolls were hand made fresh in house it didn't impact taste. The egg rolls were extremely doughy and bland. Such thick dough I didn't finish even one. Couldn't put enough sauces to add flavor. I ordered fried rice and although the egg was cooked well in the rice the veggies were so light in color they looked like they were frozen then thawed while cooked in pan. Very disappointed. The rice and veggies were very flavorless also and unfortunately within an hour of eating this take out I was sick. Avoid this place. Too many other Chinese places in area to choose from.
4 ||| My girlfriend secured a lovely room at this hotel via Travelocity's secret booking feature for something around $80 at an absolute steal.  We had a single bedroom booked but they upgraded us to a two.  More pillows!\n\nThe room was gorgeous and tasteful and the location near the Capital building and state street can't be beat. Sadly we didn't get around to any of the neat features like the arcade or the sauna, but I will say the shower in the bathroom is beautiful.\n\nIf I had the option to stay here every time I would.
4 ||| I've been a member of 24 Hour Fitness for a little over 4 years.  I go to the Camelback location 6 days a week.  The club changed management sometime last fall and I've seen a noticeable improvement.  Machines still break frequently, but they are usually repaired in a timely fashion.  If I notice something is broken, I just let the front desk know and they are very helpful.  I used to see so many \"out of order\" signs on the cardio equipment and I'm seeing less and less nowadays.  The bathrooms leave something to be desired.  There have been long-standing issues with backed up sinks and broken toilets in the women's restroom.  I've had my locker broken in to twice (once in Oct 2011 and once in May 2013) so now I just change at work and keep my bag with me rather than leaving it in a locker.  Management is aware of the theft problems, as they have hired security to patrol the parking lot and installed cameras.  It seems they are doing everything they can since obviously installing cameras in the locker rooms isn't an option.  I think theft is an issue in most gym locker rooms, so this isn't unique to 24 Hour Fitness or the Camelback location.  I can't complain at all about the staff.  Everyone is very nice and more than willing to help you.  Some of them even take the time to learn your name.  I wish I could remember some of their names so I could give them credit on yelp.  Anyway...overall, I would recommend 24 Hour Fitness if you're looking for a no frills gym.
1 ||| Not sure what was more fun, waiting 5 minutes for the bartender to notice me standing at the bar with a \"Please sell me a beer\" look on my face, or smoking roughly four packs of secondhand smoke. HH does not strive to be any more than a local dive popular with regulars, and on that in succeeds. It's larger than it appears from the outside, with a bar in the center, seating to the right and darts and pool tables to the left. On the Friday night we dropped by, there were only two women behind the bar and no servers. No one was complaining, so I figure this is pretty typical. About a dozen beers on tap, largely domestic, and it's cheap. It was a buck seventy five for a bottle of Bud Light, though most people were opting for the small pitchers at $4. All well and good unless you happen to be one of two nonsmokers who might drop by. The haze is so think that even if sunlight were allowed to illuminate HH's dark corners, it wouldn't penetrate the many smoky layers. Odds are excellent that at some point, airborne molecules from a Tareyton smoked in the mid-70s were inhaled. On May 1, 2007, when Arizona goes smokeless, Hidden House will be like the speakeasys during Prohibition. Smoking here will continue and no one will mind. \"Password?\" \"The smoking-lung cancer link is a myth, so gimme a light.\" \"OK, you're in. Just leave any filtered cigarettes at the door.\"
3 ||| We go to basketball games here, NBA exhibition and Olympic practices. I'd give it five stars but the parking makes it hard to get out unless you park near the exit which makes for a long walk to the stadium.  Great hotdogs and friendly staff. ;)
4 ||| Had the Turkey sandwich with green chile.  Really friendly family and the sandwich was excellent!  Great family place to stop!!
4 ||| They are friendly and helpful here, offering information on low-income spay and neuter programs to those who need them. My dog is in good hands when she's there, and I can trust the staff. We'll be back, for sure.
0 ||| Lulu's Noodles has a major identity crisis.  It's a weird hybrid of Chinese, Thai, and other asian dishes, except for it doesn't really execute any of them correctly.  It's probably the worst Asian food I've ever had- I'd rather go to panda express, honestly.  I got the pad thai and it definitely wasn't pad thai in any form....  Even the bubbles in the bubble tea were gross and soggy.\n\nI guess its redeeming qualities were that it's cheap and convenient.  But with two other asian restaurants close by, why bother.
0 ||| I've been here once and I chose Nancy, because on the site, she had the most raved reviews. I'm never coming back. We texted back and forth so I could get a feel for the price and her experience. She said she charges $35-$80 depending on the complexity of the up-do...so I chose an easy yet elegant up-do for my formal affair. I would need the trial and then again for the day of. First of all, she showed up late to the appointment; about 15min. I brought with me the photo of a non-complicated up-do. She was going extremely slow....not just \"taking her time.\" As she was chatting and rummaging around for her curling iron she kept mentioning her other services...which is fine but after I say not interested...its rude to keep pushing for it, and pushing for more. To say the least I was annoyed at this point, I came to relax and get my hair done not have a yappy salesman in my ear the whole time. She was also eating up time by starting out with putting the curling iron on the lowest setting, I could tell because when the curl hit my neck, it was barely warm! (My hair is noticeably thick and I was wearing extensions that day). She kept saying, I'll turn it up a little higher but if it doesn't work, under the heat with curlers you'll need to do. What?! I straighten my hair damn near every day without damaging or burning it...what was she up to? Then at the end of it all, I knew. When it came time to pay I asked her how much.....Well, come to find out she charges...BY THE HOUR, not by the up-do like she previously texted me. Even though she was late, even though she took her sweet ol' time, I didn't complain because I thought I was being charged for the complexity of the up-do. Even though she was late...she factored in that time too. So 2 hours. Yep, took her 2 hours and she charged me $80 for this trial! Because this up-do was so NOT complicated, my mother in law volunteered to do it for the day of and it came out way more beautiful, cost me nothing, and it took her 30 minutes! I was scammed by Nancy. I hope she reads this! Nancy, if customers want additional services, you only have to mention it once! Never lie to get a customer to get them in the door and then change everything when it comes time to pay to get the highest amount mentioned!
4 ||| Slippery pig saved our butts.\nMy husband and I both got flat tires on a night out on the bikes, slippery pig was close and open!  Well not open for long, we had to high tail it over there to get the tires replaced.\nThe gentleman who helped us was quick and friendly.  He suggested better tubes that could handle the thorns that are generally in the neighborhoods around there.  We took him up on it and they have worked great so far!\nThe only small gripe is when we were leaving my chain fell off, granted they were basically closing the doors, the guy that helped us out said to bring it back tomorrow and they would fix it.  Yikes.  But once we explained that we would be riding the bikes home he let us bring it back in and they quickly tightened the chain.  No problems since!
0 ||| If I could go lower than one star I would. We made a reservation to pick us up at our home to take us to the airport. We saw them drive by at the specified time, then when we called they said someone else got our cab! We ended up waiting 20 more minutes for another cab and by that time we almost missed our flight! Horrible service! And the cab driver didn't even know how to get to the airport!
0 ||| This place made me so sick and I have an iron stomach for sushi. The volcano roll was horrible. Tasted like old hot canned tuna fish with mayo and cream cheese. I will never even think about going here again. Also horrible service. I'm not one to write many review but this place should not have as many stars as it does. Do not go here!
4 ||| I love the doc (Dr Bozeman) and am excited to try the new massage therapist they just added.  I don't know about pricing bc my insurance covers it and my copay is only $25.
1 ||| I went to dinner here last night and the food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. They didn't have a very big selection and I was not impressed.
4 ||| Amazing crepes!\n\nMy wife and I love this place.  We often stop by and try different crepes, my favorite has to be the Russian blintz and her's is the Nutella and banana.  I highly recommend getting a Cafe Au-Lait with your crepe.  \n\nNo complaints about this cozy little creperie.
4 ||| now that i live within walking distance of the paisley, it's become an addiction.  i would describe them as a catch all place for beer, wine, coffee, and food.  quite random inside actually, with all of the bikes and flags and the muddy fish tank (bleh, really guys?)...\n\nlots of good wines and the beer selection is random and changes often...what i really come here for though is the food..lots of vegetarian options..my favorite would have to be the veggie burger...served panini style and made of brown rice and delicious veggies you seriously can't go wrong...their el greco sandwich is killer as well, if you're a meat eater, and it's served on this delicious toasted sourdough bagette.  their pasta salad is spot on too, i always get that as my side.\n\nstaff is friendly, your typical grand ave crowd can be seen here..randomness at it's finest...nice outdoor patio area, can't wait for the weather to cool down and enjoy some delicious brew and a tasty sandwich.
3 ||| This place comes down to what you order. I'm not a huge OJ fan, but boy, FRESH OJ does the body real good after you've destroyed your liver the night before. \n\nThe oven baked corned beef omelette is a great choice for those who love eggs AND also want some corned beef. It goes so well with Gouda cheese. I mean, you can PICK GOUDA cheese?! REALLY?! I was sold. \n\nChocolate chip pancakes- sugar high but oh so good.\n\nBelgian waffles- I asked for well done since I like them golden brown and crispy. Batter was legit. \n\nSausage- normal brekkie links but I made my own pigs in a blanket by ordering them on the side. \n\nI can't wait to try the apple pancakes that others have mentioned and the potato pancakes. I'm a huge fan of this place, and service is impeccable so far. \nThe wait was 5 minutes my first time. On NY day, it was 30, but that's expected. \n\nI knocked off one star since the second visit, they had overloaded the omelette with too much cheese, that it took over the corned beef flavor to an extreme. But, my first visit was love at first bite, so I'll keep this at a 4 star.
1 ||| This school is for-profit, and proudly NON-PLAY based. People here will say any school that IS play based is a \"daycare\". From what I learned about this school, there is a lot of super-structured worksheet and ditto-based learning -- really boring stuff for kids as young as 4 or 5. There seems to be a lot of squabbling between the children instead of proper conflict resolution due to limited toys and resources.\n\nAdults are always trying to turn children into small grown ups. We want kids to grow up so quickly and be the best at everything, instead of loving our children for who they are. Children need support, love, room to grow and fail, as well as PLAY TIME! Just like we work for part of the day and have other aspects of our life, a child's day can't be ENTIRELY play based. However, play should be valued and supported.\n\nFor parents who I know work at Intel, or other places nearby, this is not the school for your bright, intelligent or gifted children -- especially if you want your child's intelligence and creativity fostered! \n\nPlus, the owner of the school is a businesswoman. She doesn't really seem to have any passion or interest in education or its merits whatsoever.\n\nBe warned!
0 ||| I have been with Progressive for almost 5 years.  I recently canceled a policy due to the selling of a vehicle, and they sent me a bill for $31 for canceling the policy.  They told me that it was a law by Arizona.  I also see several people complaining about them in regards to them not being responsive to claims that are filled.  Fortunately I haven't had to file a claim with them yet, but I may think about switching.  Although, I would get charged $60 to cancel my other two policies.  I asked the lady if that was their way of kicking a customer in the butt on the way out and she said \"well, no\".\n\nWhat a joke!
3 ||| I always feel bad to go out on a Holiday. My girlfriend really does not like to. Because,she says it makes the stores be open and people have to work on the Holiday.\nBut, Today,(New Years Day) we went to Cracker Barrel.\nMy girlfriend tipped very well because of the guilt.\nThey were packed! \nWe got a table just at the other end of the Fireplace near the window. It was freezing. I think because, they had all the fans on and it was only 52 outside. This is why only 4 stars,it was sooooo cold.\nAnyway, our food was excellent! Stephanie was our waitress, she was great!\nWe ordered Breakfast even though it was 1pm. \nThey will give you either one,breakfast or lunch. Another great thing about them.\nEven though they were so busy we still had great service and our food was awesome.\nI really wish they did not have to work on a Holiday, But, it was great so Thank you employees of Cracker barrel.\nAlso we bought some stuff from the store they have some cool items in that little country store.
0 ||| Absolutely horrible service. They refused to do propane after their streetlights come on even if it's a bright out tried to tell me he would get fired. Five people waiting for propane and he refused to come outside told me the propane tank turns off because the sun starts to set.
3 ||| We had our order to go.  Service was fast and food was hot.   The gyros were stuffed full of meat.  The topper was the FRESH tomatoes.  Not used at other gyro places in town.  Make this a stop on your next trip to State St.
2 ||| Hello Friends,\n\nAn angel spoke to me in my dream one night saying, \"Gooooo toooo Mr. K'ssssss\" No wait, that may have been a ghost. Probably was a little more Angelic. Man I gotta stop eating so late. But anywayyyyyyy\n\nI woke up ran a few errands. Then that voice popped back up. So I made my way on over to this Charlotte Staple! If I'm not mistakin Charlotte has its share of Mr. K's, Mr. C's & a few other letters. (I remember Mr. C's on the West Side. But I digress)\n\nIn trying to find out who has the best burgers between Mr. Ks & Zacks. I walked in was happily greeted. Took a few ticks to see the menu. Then decided on the Double Cheese Burger on Onion Bun. Whaaaaaddd!! It was pretty good goin down. Later that evening I was going through while it was coming back to life in my belly. I'll try it again Just to give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThey have an GiNormus amount of frozen drink combos. I'll have to come back just to get my crack at it!!\n\nNow maybe it wasn't an angel. Hummm. Well anyway like I typed. I'll give em another shot & update my review once done. \n\nTTFN
0 ||| Allow me to justify the 1-Star rating I've awarded Fabulous Freddy's:\n\nI haven't brought my car to a full-service wash for several years now; I have a modified vehicle and not only is it sensitive, but it's delicate when not handled correctly.\nEvery person that worked there seemed to crowd around my car and helped with the cleaning...all 35 minutes of it!\n\n-They cleaned it once, some kid brought it around to be picked up then brought it right back under cover for him and his buddies to once again clean for an additional 15 minutes.  \n-When all was said and done he started my car, and what was to follow nearly gave me a heart attack.  He starts my car and lets it idle for 5 minutes, for whatever reason.  My car is not designed to sit and idle...especially without anyone feathering the throttle!  Then I hear the little bastard revving it!  Really.....a car wash is going to allow their employees to rev customer's cars?  This is crazy poor management.\n\nHe drove it around the corner...I smiled politely (all while driving my teeth up into my skull out of anger), gave no tip, got in and drove off.
4 ||| After having a stressful morning with the serpentine belt snapping on my Jeep, going to Inman & Sons made everything better! They were very friendly and honest. The belt was $120 installed which Power Jeep quoted me $210. I chose to go here after reading reviews on Yelp and am sure glad I did. I will be going to Inman from here on out!
4 ||| Our go-to place in Vegas for pho after a long night of partying. The service is great, the food comes out fast, and the pho is pretty decent. \n\nI've had other pho places on Spring Mountain and I can say this is one of the better ones.
4 ||| Was leaving the Wachovia parking lot in U-City, and my car wouldn't start. Searched on my phone for the nearest auto repair, and Griffin Brothers came up. Called them, and they sent a tow out for me. They were able to look at it, but unfortunately it was late in the day so I would have to wait until the next day. They provided a shuttle to my house and picked me up the next morning. Luckily it was just the battery. Good service and they were sympathetic.
4 ||| I love this store!!! Everyone is happy and kind.
4 ||| I was in Vegas for 4 days and ate here twice - I am sad I didn't get to eat here for every meal the entire time I was there. I had the chicken teriyaki which was great, but perhaps one of the best meals I have ever had was the pan fried noodles, #62. The crab rangoon was fantastic, the best I have ever had. My husband had the pho soup and the Singapore noodles, he was thrilled with both. \n\n If I could have picked this restaurant up and carried to Florida with me I would have! This was the best food I have had in Vegas yet.
4 ||| I have been looking to branch out and explore the various yoga studios at Charlotte. This morning I had the great fortune to experience a PureHot 90 class with Suzanne. She started the class by personally introducing herself to the new yogis, including myself. She was encouraging and positive throughout the class. The class was hot without being sickeningly hot, and Suzanne was always cognizant of the temperature in the room. \nOverall, I loved the vibe here! Everyone seems warm and caring. The class was challenging and inspirational. This is what yoga is all about.
2 ||| This place is alright, and I'm not even from the South.  A certain restaurant in California has better food then Boudreaux's.  \n\nThe gumbo soup was thick and almost like a paste when it should have been soupy.  The etouffe looked like some kind of an Asian dish, with it's near orange consistency and watered down taste.  The balsamic vinegar dressing for their house salad was so acidic that it burnt my girlfriend's throat that she had to ask for something else.  \n\nThe only that was was really quite good were the crawfish/spinach/cheese chips dip.  Absolutely delighted with the way it tasted!  But other than that I will probably not be returning to this restaurant again.
4 ||| Stayed here a few times and I do like the rooms. If you are looking for a nice, clean, basic Vegas resort this is the place for you. The hotel and casino are relatively small so everything is conveniently located, just a hop, skip and a jump from your room to the casino to the pool or parking garage. The prices are a hit or miss, sometimes they have really great deals and sometimes they are just downright terrible. They have a 24 hour gift shop (located next to the elevators of the two towers of the hotel) that has munchies, moonshine and gifts, which is nice. They have a few restaurants which are open a little late but do close so if the tummy starts to growl after a night of partying you might want to grab something to eat on the way back to the hotel or you'll starve. There really isn't anywhere to party in this resort. It is more of a gamble, sleep, repeat kind of place. The pools are relaxing, the beds are comfy and the views are decent...perfect for those that are in Vegas for a chill weekend.
0 ||| Also note they lie when you fight it with your bank.  Sadly I left the country to move back to England so communicating with the bank is so slow this company days in lied to steal money from me when I never stayed there. I actually booked with a better place that was not a **** hole of a place. Trust me. Same price by the airport and your in a luxury.  Don't trust this pace. Unfair 15 mins refund before you even see a room. Rooms are disgusting. Cheap and not worth 25 to 30 dollars including tax and that's being fair.  Owner is well full of him self and cares not about his customers. That's why they hide the 15 mins warning out of plan site. \n\nAny hotel or motel will and should let you see a room before you commit. So don't trust this place and if you want bed bugs. I can bet this place does. Sheets looked old. \n\nBe very careful. Go to better places. Check airport hotels. Same price and so much better.
2 ||| Whats the owners name and I know Ms Li i don't her last name did sOmebody give me her name I'm not sure
0 ||| Wow i would say to you, what a rip off. So on my trip to arizona i had my front brakes and rotors done for 300 dollars in my town, when arriving to pick a trailer up i noticed the back needed to be replaced before i drove back to arizona. When i came over to see they told me the total would be 700+ dollars for brakes and rotors. I was blown away. I walked out paying 560 at the end, took it into the same shop who did my fronts and they told me i was ripped for about 200 buck of unnecessary stuff on my invoice...Would recommend not ever going here....or any just brakes read all the other stores review first....
1 ||| If you're used to the \"right coast\" or \"left coast\" locations of this place, you'll be sadly disappointed by Charlotte's offerings. Super small, minimal selection, and their pastry items tend to run on the stale side of  \"a day old.\"
0 ||| Dear Redfin Blues,\n\nI can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the \"list\". To which she replied \"what list?\" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up.
4 ||| Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very good. In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was incredible. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1.
4 ||| The restaurant so nice, they named it... well, you get the idea. I really like China China. Not only because it's fun to say, but also because it's cheap-as-hell and tasty. Not great, not healthy, but tasty in that \"I really want cheap, greasy Americanized Chinese food the way I remember eating it in 1985 in suburban Wisconsin\" sort of way.\n\nThe lunch specials are hard to beat. For $5.25 you can get a cup of pretty tasty soup, an egg roll, wonton and a main dish (fried tofu and veggies for me, but my friend had the kung pao veggies and they were also good).\n\nAgain, don't go here for a gourmet experience, but for a cheap Americanized-Chinese food experience.\n\nOther stars are for the setting (clean and with cute little blossom-painted paper lanterns above the booths) and for the very friendly waitstaff.
0 ||| So me and some  friend went to this I hop today. I have the worst service I have ever had in my life. My friend had to wait about 20 more minutes for his food to come while we had ours ready. I had to remind the waiter that there was still an order missing. He brought it right away so we could tell it had been ready all along. He just forgot it. He didn't ask my other friend what kind of sauce she would like for her chicken. He didn't bring us syrup for our pancakes until much later. It felt like he wasn't all there. The wrost thing that happened was he didn't let us pay at the front so we could all split our tabs. Because of this,  he confused our payments and i ended up paying more than i should have. He was unprofessional and seemed like it was his first day at the job. I think he shouldve comped one of the meals to make up for the mistakes. Me and my friends are not satisfied with that waiter and it has made us not want to go to that location anymore.
3 ||| Good place with decent drink prices.  Wish they were open a little earlier...
2 ||| Good place to find cheap stuff. Pretty good selection of cheap gourmet food items. Be careful though, when you go here you end up buying things that you don't even want/need because you are certain that everything you buy is a deal.
4 ||| I used Sharko's catering for my March wedding this year. They far exceeded all of my expectations. We had them cater Mexican food for the wedding and it was phenomenal; we got a lot of compliments that it was the best wedding food people had ever tasted. We did buffet style and their dishes were very nice and classy. The servers did a great job making sure that everyone's water and wine glasses stayed full.\n\nWe also rented the tables, chairs, and table cloths from them. They had a lot of options for different linens. They brought the tables the day before the wedding at the time I requested and set them all up with the linens so everything was ready to go the next day. We had our ceremony and reception in the same hall and they went above and beyond and did the whole rearranging in between the ceremony and reception, while serving appetizers in a different area. They were happy to do this and did an excellent job following the rough outline I had drawn. \n\nI would definitely recommend Sharko's for any event, as their food and customer service are both great.
0 ||| Very bad food. Located in a seedy part of town. Was actually afraid walking in.\nNothing was good. Even with the low standards of Indian restaurants in Charlotte, this one should be avoided
0 ||| Horrible.  I called at 8:45 this morning.  An hour later and still no cab.  I called again and they said they haven't dispatched a cab yet.  Another 30 minutes and still no cab.  Called again and they said it could take 2 hours.  What is the point of a cab of you have to wait that long?  Luckily, I had a friend pick me up.  It is now 11 hours later, no cab, no call, nothing.  Worst customer service I've ever had.  If you can't make it you can't make it, but just be upfront and tell me.  I hope Lyft and Uber run YC out of business.
4 ||| Great tasting food! Server needs to listen better! ! When the food got to the table right it was outstanding! ! P.S. had to wait 10 minutes to be seated in a 1/2 empty restaurant.
0 ||| Horrible horrible company!!! If you're on a budget don't come here, they'll RIP you off!! \n\nWe rented a car 10/4/14 through 10/6/14 for my sister in law. She was added and we added the additional budget insurance. She brought the car back dirty. But not dirty enough to rack up 250$ of detailing fees! They took photos and sent them via email. Talking about stains. Believe me, there was no stains! There was some crumbs on the seat and some dirt on the floors but nothing a vacuum couldn't handle. Now, I don't know what the intentions were of the employees that service the vehicles, but I'm suspecting they get a bonus for every car they detail, or somebody wants a raise! You know it don't cost 250$ to detail a car! \n\nI've been trying to handle this manner but talk about BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, I have yet spoken to a supervisor about theses excessive fees! I've called the Budget 800#  and I've spoken to countless representatives, why, because they can't get it right the first time and the supervisor can only call you or email you back within 24-48 hours!\n\nThis company is a joke. If you run into trouble with these guys, it's a pure run around! I will be looking into exposing this company for what they are, greedy uncaring scheming business operators! I really want to call them something else right now!
4 ||| I really like Port of Subs sandwiches.  I usually get #6-vegetarian.  You have a choice of three cheeses, but I always get triple Provolone. The bread they bake tastes really good and doesn't flake when I eat, unlike another major sandwich chain.  It's not dry either and I don't feel like I need to wash the particles down with a drink. \n\nPort of Subs is right down the street from where I work, which is perfect because they are quick and always have a smile.  Employees are always helpful and help me out when I make a lunch run for the office.  I always ask if I can hand them the post-its of orders and not once have they rolled their eyes.  They take them all, stick them on the counter and begin making the sandwiches.  When they're done, they will mark the wrapper with an initial or something for easy identifying. \n\nI just love coming here. Sandwiches are made tasty by friendly employees.  Plus, coupons arrive in the mail frequently and I can use my student ID at this location to get a small combo for $5.49.  Not bad for a student on a budget!
2 ||| Really bland tasting food, and annoying atmosphere, as well as annoying staff. The food has nothing unique about it. I wish the fries were good so \"bottomless fries\" meant something to me. The table we sat at was REALLY close to another table (there is a row of crammed tables) and the people next to us were eavesdropping the entire time. Quite uncomfortable, but the only seating available. They brought out an entirely wrong burger to me, but gave me a $20 giftcard since they messed up, so that was cool.
4 ||| So today the hearty and flavorful sandwich makes the leap into  becoming the Siracca beef fully involved medium sub! A joint effort by Mr. Gimon and Mr.Flenor crafted beautifully and very tasty.\nThank you Firehouse challenge for the combo coupon!  The extra Siracca sauce is very important when ordering the sub version. The Swiss cheese really brings out the flavor of the roast beef.
3 ||| Wow' I love a thin crust pizza and this is great stuff. Always hot and fresh daily. By the slice is a great fast lunch any day of the week! Try the Chicken Alfredo! Delish!
0 ||| Waitress did not know prices of anything not already printed on the menu. Fly in Margarita. Order was wrong. Member of our party who cannot eat lettuce or health reasons had to pick s\nThe shredded lettuce off his sandwich. I had to eat my appetizer off a napkin because I was never given a plate. When I waived at the manager she \"didn't see me\". Overall an awful experience. I will not dine here again.
4 ||| This place is always delicious. I always start off with the anti pasto salad...best I've ever had. Pizza is cooked perfectly with very fresh ingredients. And the desert choke is the best desert I have had. Mouth watering. This place has so much to offer and is always busy but always has great service!
4 ||| best mongolian beef anywhere, swear....
3 ||| Good sandwiches as you expect, but a bit of a touristic atmosphere.  I'm a stickler for the original in the strip!
1 ||| My purpose for using this library is for work and to occasionally check out a book.  As a consultant I often have time that I \"work from home\" and this library is my go-to spot for getting out of the apartment and working in an environment where I don't have to buy a coffee every day.  \n\nWhile this library is very nice in that it is clean and very aesthetically pleasing, it drives me nuts in almost every other way possible.  \n\nPros:\n- attractive space\n- plenty of tables to read/study/work\n- internet service is fairly fast for a public space\n\nCons:\n- The entire library is one open space in which sound travels fascinatingly well.  Whoever designed this building is an idiot.  \n- The staff couldn't be less concerned about controlling the noise level.  \n- I've never seen more poorly mannered children in my entire life than in this library. \n- I dare you to walk into this library looking for a specific book and walk out with it.  Save yourself the trouble by finding it on their online catalog and having it sent to the library.
2 ||| Ok.... Been over a year since last visit.  Where shall we start...... Server was in a rush to take out order.   No bread was offered.   Ordered side of soup, no crackers were served.  Had to ask a manager for crackers.  Food was fairly decent.
0 ||| The worst food I have ever had in my entire life. \n\nI had the enchilada plate and it was disgusting. The rice was half cooked and tasted like some little kid TRIED to cook Hamburger Helper and FAILED miserably. The enchilada was cold and tasted like mush. \n\nI usually eat everything in front of me- I love food that much- but this restaurant served microwave food (at least it tasted like it). I could not even finish half of my plate.\n\nThe chips and salsa and guacamole did not have enough flavor. This food is overall not edible. The waitress was too busy watching tv and was difficult to get her attention.\n\nI went to Pasqual's because I had friends from the area who grew up going there and recommended it. Well, the food was awful. I think people who still go there and think the food is ok, I'm sure it's just the nostalgic effect of going there at lunch in high school or something. Anyone with taste buds minus the sentimental effect, would not even finish the food they order from this restaurant. \n\nSave your money and just buy TV dinner if you really want shitty food like served in this restaurant. You even have to pay for chips and salsa. Puhleaseeeee get over yourself Pasqual's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3 ||| We expected great things and for the most part we weren't disappointed, I just expected more.  \n\nBeing from Montana, and in the Southwest on vacation, I thought after reading reviews I'd be in for something special.  What I got was typical Mexican fare and flare without being dazzled.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was still very good.  Just not special.\n\nI will give them a nod for their home made hot sauce.  Very very spicy and very very delicious.\n\nNo ground beef.  Shredded only.\n\nSmall indoor dining room with rustic chairs tables.  Not very comfortable in the chair department but the Mexican theme is strong inside.\n\nOutside is also nice when it's cooler.\n\nStandouts to me were the the sauce mentioned earlier along with the cheese enchilada.
3 ||| It's a simple order at the window, pay, take a seat, wait for your number to be called, and eat system. Portions are big, food taste Mexican- American, and good prices. I would consider this an upscale Taco Bell. The cashier was very informative and helpful. He had some good recommendations.  They have a great selection for the free salsa bar. Free nachos are always good. I got the carne Asada tacos which were good. I also went for the tamales which were pretty authentic. Save room for dessert bc the fried ice cream is pretty legit. I was overall satisfied. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing negative hence only 4 stars.
4 ||| Great Store.  The amount and the variety of stock is awesome.  Easily one of the best crystal/rock shops I have seen in my travels.
0 ||| If I could give it zero stars I would!\nUntil Friday night Nikko was my favorite place to dine out in the Charlotte area. My kids knew it was \"Mommy's favorite restaurant\". We went here for birthdays, date nights and special occasions - never leaving with a bill under $300. In the past my friends and I got a kick out of the antics of Joanna the owner. However, Friday night I was appalled! She was obviously high on drugs! She started off repeating herself and not leaving our table after my husband and friends ordered Saki Bombs (she had 1 too - like she needed anything else to add to her buzz). Joanna then proceeded to pick several pieces of sushi off our platter, eat the fish off, spit out the rice - guess she's on a diet and watching her carbs - and put her 1/2 eaten saliva covered food back on our platter with our uneaten food. If this were not disgusting enough she ate 1/2 a piece of sushi and shoved the other half into my friends mouth!!! I was appalled to say the least and went to the hostess stand to get the manger. When I returned to the table she was hanging on my husband asking him \"Why you married to such a bitch?\" Carter, the manager, had Joanna removed from our table and hopefully sent home to sober up. We did not see her again that evening thank God! Our very embarrassed waitress and the manager handled the situation very well. Thank you to them. Joanna - thank you for ruining my birthday dinner! Thanks to you, I will be finding a new favorite restaurant!
0 ||| Very disappointed that the original owners aren't there anymore .. They used to be very good and very close to New York Pizza , now the pizza is horrible . It's either under cooked or burnt . I wouldn't recommend a Sicilian pie , they have no clue . The chicken parm hero is soggy ..  I had to wait over an hour and a half for my pizza bc it was either burnt or they gave it away . I would never go back
4 ||| We've lived in Mesa AZ for over 9 years and only did we visit this place. I was surprised that there was more to see and learn about Goldfield. The train ride was informative and really worth the price of the ride. The engineer/guide on the train was very funny, which made for the ride to be more tolerable in the summer heat. Overall, if you're a history buff, this is place to come to.
0 ||| Kitchen was very slow, all food did not come at same time 15 minutes from the first delivery of food until the last person got there. The food was extremely over cooked and cold \n\nWould never come back
1 ||| The turkey sandwich tasted great!! The service was nice and prompt. Well priced as well. \nWhy the two stars? My husband and I felt sick to our stomachs after eating it. Didn't throw up but felt like it.
2 ||| This place is downright bizarre.  it's run by the same people who run Greek Isles, which means most of the menu is Greek with some pasta and \"creole\" items.  I say \"creole\" because there is like 2 items on the menu that are supposed to be New Orleans style and those at the tables around us who ordered the special (chicken creole) left most of it on their plate. \n\nI had a caesar salad and it, I kid you not, comes out in a mixing bowl.  it's huge and really a total waste of salad because it would take 3-4 people to finish one.  I barely made a dent in it.  The salad was just alright, nothing terribly impressive.  \n\nDuring the week it's full of blue shirts watching ESPN.
0 ||| \"Worst meal I ever ate\" says my 4 yr old daughter. My wife and I agreed with her. The wings were so overcooked, they were nearly impossible to separate the chicken from the bone.  Strangely enough, my daughter is keeling over in pain and my wife just puked 3 times, despite eating the most overdone wings we've ever had. \n\nThey total redid the interior and got rid of the fun arcade games my daughter and I used to play here. Instead, they run an insanely loud game that was so loud I couldn't even hear what my wife ordered. \n\nThe only redeeming thing was that the waitress was nice.
4 ||| This is my  \"go to\" nail salon in the Plaza Midwoodish area.  I have tried quite a few in the area, and I end up back at this one everytime.\n\nIf you do gel, this is the most reasonable price in the area, they charge $25.\n\nPedicures are $25 and regular manicures are $12.\n\nThey have the vibrating chairs and also do waxing.  There is sometimes a wait...but they are usually pretty quick.  Weekdays are best!  It's in the Family Dollar plaza across from Ross/Food Lion.  A little sketch but the Police station is a few store fronts down so there's never any issues.\n\nMy favorite nail tech is the woman straight in front when you first walk in.  Her gel manis last me a full 2- 2 1/2 weeks and the regular manis always last a full week!\n\nThe clientele can be very interesting.....at least go for the entertainment factor!   ;)
2 ||| Meh, Pier 1 I can love or hate you, depending on the season (or should I say how you rush the seasons).  It delights me when you are in the summer/push to fall season and you have all the different colors in the store.  But I have to say that I am totally not into you when you start putting out candle holders that are to resemble reindeer.  I try to stay clear of your store when this happens.\n\nIt's like a higher end tchotchke store.  Sure you could find something of your interest in there, but definitely not an essential that you'll need.
0 ||| Food poisoning! Yikes! AVOID
4 ||| Courier Cafe is a long time favorite place of mine to go in the Champaign-Urbana area.  The atmosphere can't be beat, the hometown old-fashioned feel is very warm and welcoming.  I love the look of it from the street with the lights framing the windows.\n\nThe food has always been decent.  The Dagwood is especially good and the milkshakes are yummy.  The salad bar offers a nice selection as well.\n\nDefinitely beats all the \"chain\" restaurants in town.
1 ||| First time customer 5/10/213.\n\n They are not very through. Went in for an inspection and failed due a broken passenger mirror and weak wipers. I repaired the mirror at another location and they noticed my belts were split and cracking very badly. If it was not for the mirrors, they would have passed me and my car would have been in bad shape later down the road. I'm glad I did not get my oil changed there who knows what would have happened
1 ||| I Am Former New Yorker So I Know My Pizza. My Husband & I were walking on the Southside We decided to go to Gennaro's for dinner. He ordered 3 slices Xcheese & pep. And I order a Seafood Fettachini Dish. Well the pizza was layered w/ burnt sauce and dry cheese the seafood stuff was over cooked noodles watery sauce and old under cooked shrimp. They did give me a refund for the seafood & a homeless guy outside got the other 2 slices. Restaurant was sticky/dirty & out of date. Girl behind counter that took the order looked high on something. Avoid this place the locals say try Sal's.
4 ||| John Rader has been managing my personal and corporate finances for the past decade. \n\nJohn is one of my favorite people on earth. Not only is he very well versed in tax law/accounting, but he is also a very sweet, caring soul making him an absolute pleasure to do business with! John has also gone on to manage the finances for my ENTIRE FAMILY because of the superior job he has done for me in this area of my life.\n\nThe ground floor office for Coffey & Rader is easily accessible from Sahara with plenty of parking right out front. The office itself is a very happy, comfortable environment. Natalie (Office Manager), is a long time employee of the firm who is an absolute pleasure as well!\n\nI WOULDN'T TRUST MY FINANCIAL AFFAIRS IN ANYONE ELSE'S HANDS!!! PERIOD.
0 ||| If I could give Cox a rating of zero stars I would! The worst customer service I have experienced as far as an Internet Service provider. I called to make a payment so I dialed the main 800 number but because it was not for Residential Internet Service I was given a number in the automated system to dial. Whatever happened to automatic transfer of phone calls? Then when I try to make a payment they say I will be charged an extra $10 if made through a representative? WTF? Canceling service as soon as I can.
4 ||| I eat here or order in whenever I visit my family who live out in Phoenix.  They have tasty American food, competent staff and a great selection of alcohol for beer or wine lovers.  Their steak sandwich is excellent as is their ceasar salad and fries.\n I would say their only downsides are that their prices felt a bit high for the portions that they offer and the dining atmosphere is only okay.  But, if you want a good American meal eat here, you won't be disappointed.
1 ||| I needed a backup, for emergencies only sort of account, somewhere I could put money and forget about it until the day rolled around I needed it. It was a mistake getting it from BOA. \nI need to take some of the blame though, I am the one who opened a BOA account and didn't realize I needed to have paperless billing or I would be charged $9 A MONTH. After many months have passed I finally checked my statement to realize I didn't have enough in savings (the majority was all in checking) which charged me an additional $5, so for months I have been being charged $14. \nI'm willing to take responsibility for that. But, I do think it's pretty crappy to charge someone that much a month in fees!\n\nI stopped in this branch yesterday to close the account and was surprised how little they seemed to care. We exchanged greetings and chatted about our Halloween and what each of us were doing. I told him I needed to close both my savings and checking account, he said OK and printed off the paperwork no questions asked. Really? No Questions? This bothered me more than the fees, he never asked me why I'm closing the account, never asked if there was anything he could do to keep me a member, seemed pretty happy to let me go. I've heard this from other people, BOA just doesn't care about their members. If he would have asked why I was leaving and asked to look at my account to see how we could eliminate fees from that point forward I may have considered staying a member, but to no avail, he just didn't care.
4 ||| With a ton of lunch options in the Uptown area, Matt's Chicago Dog is definitely one of my lunch \"go-to\" options.  It's located off of the Green which is great if you are sitting in a cubicle all day and need some vitamin D.\n\nThey keep it pretty simple... dogs and burgers/sandwiches.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming with options, but I haven't had a bad sandwich or item here.  You come in, fall into line, place your order, and wait for your delicious food to be brought to the table (dining in) or your number to be called out (take out).\n\nThe dining space is small and cramp (like everything else in uptown) but they make the most out of the space with plenty of tables, sometimes it's hard to procure a table yourself, but the turn around is quick and you also have the option of taking the food outside on the Green.  Pretty interesting mural painted on the wall to make it look like you aren't inside, but outside on the street - props to the artist that can paint glass reflections on the store windows.\n\nOK... I haven't had a chicago dog here (gasp!) but all the rest of the food I have had here has been very solid so I am sure their Chicago dogs are great.  It's not Chicago, but it can definitely hold it's own.
2 ||| Haiku for Average\n\nMeals\nService\nWaits\n\nI initially wrote my bad Haiku on the Midtown IHOP.  I'd noted how few words and sentences people use in reviews, gave mine some old Japanese flair.  Unfair.    \n\nMidtown IHOP List:\n\n - Open 24 Hours.\n - Best items on the menu, breakfasts, served 24 hours/day.\n - Low to moderate prices.  \n - Three streets north of the Encanto Light Rail stop. \n - Across the street from Fairfield Inn Midtown.  Within a mile of a Hilton, Holiday Inn, Ramada, Marriott, Hampton Inn, and Extended Stay.\n - Newly redecorated.  It may be the best IHOP within 20 miles.\n - Good place for a long discussion with a friend or informal business connection.\n - Early rock and 60's soul music in the background.\n - Decent lunch and dinner entrees.\n - If your schedule is tight or you've got a half-hour lunch, this is not the place to eat.
1 ||| Pretty awful entrees, sushi wasn't bad and decent service.  The chicken they used in the pad Thai was so horrible I couldn't even eat it.  I finished half my plate and didn't get a to go box
3 ||| Ok, I heard from someone that Culver's had cheese curds.  (For those that don't know what a cheese curd is then ready this wiki article.  Don't worry I didn't know about them until I came to Wisconsin.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_curds)    So, when class got out early today, I decided that I needed to hunt for the elusive curds.  The easiest place to come was here.  But the curds are not the traditional curds, they were fried curds, like fried mozzarella.   A nice snack but not exactly was I was looking for .... on with the search.
0 ||| Terrible service! This hotel held $871 on my debit card upon checking in until my husband's company called in with their credit card. The funds were never released back into our account and it has been over 3 weeks. We have the receipt where Hilton charged the company but the GM has not been the least bit helpful and even went on vacation leaving no one to release the funds. It's Christmas time and I am 9 months pregnant, almost $1000 has been held for no reason. My husband has contacted corporate and they are currently trying to reach the GM and my bank is currently disputing these charges, but this has been a run around that both my husband and myself could have done without at this point in our lives..
1 ||| they do a good job but I have never been here for an oil change that didn't take more than an hour and a half... I  bought a group deal, so had to keep coming back, but  not the kind of time I can spend hanging out, waiting... waiting...\nJiffy lube is closer and faster.
2 ||| Weird...\n\nI expected this to be a Japanese restaurant and had been wanting to try it. I've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles. So I walked in and BAM! Italian decor? WTH was going on.\n\nThis restaurant has zero sense of identity, but decent food.\n\nThey don't really know what a vegetarian is, in spite of actually having some decent adaptable vegetarian entrees. We asked our waitress and she said, \"WELL WE HAVE SALADS!\" -_- \n\nThey need to educate the staff on the menu for situations like these, whether the person is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. So, I managed to work with Miss Clueless, and customized the pad thai - it was delicious! \n\nHonestly, I probably won't be going back. I could definitely find better Thai dishes, and can buy many of the noodles myself. It wasn't bad, just wasn't special.
0 ||| Bad haircut, filthy place.  Also kind of expensive.  Nice guys, though.
0 ||| What more can I say about buffet..... Oily, salty, and  not good.
2 ||| Had a catered lunch here. It was ok. View was great. I'd go back for the free food but not if I had to pay for it.
4 ||| Dish is one of the locally owned places that has plenty of character and quirkiness. One of the proprietors here also use to be part owner of the Milestone and  Tremont... so you can imagine that this place is going to be a little edgier than your standard southern diner. \n\nThe first time I went there, everything was absolutely fabulous. The second visit didn't blow me away, but everything was solid.  I love comfort food so one of the biggest challenges for me is deciding what to order. On both visits, they offered great specials.  But being a southern girl, one of my fav childhood dishes was grandma's chicken & dumplings... and their version is good.\n\nIf you are looking for a casual, affordable, comfort-food dining experience that isn't part of a big chain, this is a great option.  Its a great place to take out-of-town guests if you want them to experience a little local flavor.
2 ||| It seems as if my experience was not the norm. It was pretty busy while I was there, and I managed to get through security in just a few minutes. That alone substantiates my 3 star review. I wish I didn't pay for a wifi account, bc it was free here. \n\nAside from wifi and my personal experience with security, it's not actually that great of an airport. I don't think it's very well laid out, the dining options suck, there isn't enough seating at many of the gates, my flight (along with several others) had to be moved to another gate.
4 ||| One of the best Thai Restaurants in Phoenix. Nothing fancy from the outside, but inside provides an authentic vibe, great service and amazing food at good prices. The new website (includes photos of dishes) helps with take-out ordering. The Pad Thai and #35 on the menu are a must.
4 ||| I have always been self-conscious about my receding hairline until Morgan cut my hair. She made me aware that I could show my hairline and that it was only natural for it to be receding \"a little.\" Because of my new haircut I feel more confident. Thank you Carsten Salon :)
1 ||| I went there for my 30th Birthday celebration. We were greeted immediately by a friendly staff member and taken to a table that was not set up for the number of guests we had even though we had called ahead several days prior for a reservation. We were given 2 dinner menus for 5 people. We asked about happy hour menu and he brought back one menu and wasn't able to answer questions about it. He took the appetizer order from 3 people and left the table without taking order from the other two. He didnt return till the appetizers came out from the original order. The apps were fantastic! (Stuffed Shrimp, Shrimp Cocktail and Salmon). We asked about the price fixed menu for $60 and he didnt really know much about it. We ordered out entrees and they arrived rather quickly. The entrees where very bland and lacked flavor and substance. I have had way better food at Olive garden, which is really sad for the price of the food.  Very disappointed.
2 ||| Harbor Freight is always a mixed bag, and you just have to know what you are buying.  Either research it, or assume it's cheap and disposable.  There are lots of gems and lots of junk too.  All of my air tools have really held up well for many years, despite being half the price (or less) compared to name brands.  I have a $180 utility trailer that has held up over many years and thousands of miles.  The hand tools vary in quality, and the handheld power tools tend towards the junkier side, but usable usually.  Forget buying the cheap welders and such.\n\nOne great thing though is that they will take anything back--no questions asked--for the first 30 days.
2 ||| They have a decent selection but no one to talk to... business goes elsewhere.
1 ||| I do not understand the other reviews.\n\nWe got excited because we heard this place had the same owner as a delicious upscale Lebanese place in Cleveland that we love with fresh, puffy pitas, fluffy rice and lovely smokey baba ganoush.\n\nThis is some of the worst middle eastern food that I have ever had. What wasn't critically overcooked was over-vinagered and over-lemoned. The baba ganoush tasted like it came from a can, the pitas are pre-packaged (like everywhere in Squirrel Hill). The server, while very nice, did not know a thing about middle eastern food and couldn't answer any of our questions about the menu. Frankly, I can't explain why I even gave it a second star, except that I'm feeling generous.\n\nIt is also not a nice place to sit, unless you enjoy the feeling of dining inside a convenience store.
1 ||| I find out that Saturn has stopped making Roof Racks for my 2003 Saturn Vue which means I cannot get a Roof Rack for my Bikes for road trips, bummer deal. Then I remember how hitch racks have gotten really awesome and that I can get a hitch installed. Well who do you go to for a hitch installation? Google results show that Uhaul is the masters of the hitch install and that being that I call Uhaul. This is where the fun begins, and by fun I mean something akin to stabbing my eyes with a pencil.\n\nThere is a Uhaul, to my chagrin, very close to my house, so I figure it will be most convenient to call them. After numerous rings I get to talk with Robin. It doesn't sound like Robin is having the best of days, or years, or perhaps longer. I tell her that I would like a hitch installed on my car and we go through the make model year routine to determine what I need installed. She wants to know where I want this done, which is an odd question since I called a specific location. We get through that and she gives me the price of $179.95 for parts, labor, and warranty. She lets me know that it may be more depending on how the wiring configuration is done but I let her know that I will not need that since I am putting a bike rack on and that will be it for the foreseable future. I get a confirmation number and she emails me the receipt. I am also told that someone will contact me to setup the appointment. This is June 10th.\n\nOn June 12th, Friday, I still have not received a call so I decide to give the Uhaul location a call back to see whats up with the appointment. I offer my confirmation number but the gentleman just wants my name. He says that the appointment is set up for Wednesday June 17th. I am surprised by this since no one ever called to set that up. I ask if we can get it done on Monday June 15th instead. The gentleman says yes that will be fine and to bring it in at 8am and that it should only take 30 minutes. I enter this into my calendar and go about my weekend.\n\nJune 15th rolls around and I go to the Uhaul for my scheduled appointment for the hitch installation. I am greeted by a gentleman walking away from me to talk with another Uhaul employee, or rather Manager/Owner James Flake. After an awkward minute of me standing at the counter 5 feet away from these two gentlemen talking about their work I finally am greeted by the younger one. I let him know that I am here for my scheduled hitch install which causes him to look over my shoulder to James and laugh. He then lets me know that James will be doing the install. I ask if I should bring the car around back and he thinks this is a good plan.\n\nAs I pull around I see another customer waiting on James and can see that things are going to be moving slowly today. I wait in my car for 10 minutes until James comes up and asks if I know that this appointment is set for Wednesday. I tell him that yes I am aware that originally it was set for that that but that I had called on Friday to reschedule. He lets me know that its going to take a while as he has deliveries to take care of but that I will be his priority. I am okay with this since I have brought my book along and have no appointments till the afternoon.\n\n10am rolls around and James Flake comes in to let me know its all done. We saddle up to the register and he tells me the total is ~$220 which I inform him is incorrect. I tell him that the total parts, labor, and warranty was quoted to me as $179.95. He snickers at me and wants to know who told me that. I explain that it was Robin to which he responds that Robin does not work there. I let him know that it is irrelevant as I was quoted $179.95 and that is what I will be paying. Another Uhaul employee comes over to see what the fuss is about and they start discussing that I was quoted the online price for the hitch which is cheaper than their price. I stand and say nothing to this.\n\nJames is still not willing to offer the price I was quoted so he lets me know that he can take the hitch off. I let him know he is welcome to do so. He then tells me that I will have to wait since he has other customers. This cracks me up because there is nothing better for your other customers than to have one who you are trying to Bait and Switch standing in your store raising hell.\n\nAnother Uhaul employee comes over and his name tag says owner as well. By this time I have found the email and let them see it. They agree to honor the price and I am on my way.\n\nClearly Uhaul has some communication issues between its stores and the central call center that my initial call was routed to. The first issue this caused was that I never got a call back for when the installation would occur. Second when I called to setup the installation time I talked with the store where I was apparently talking to someone too busy to actually write down the appointment that we set up. Third was the price issue.
4 ||| Your typical bowling alley.  Cocktails are about $3.50, glow bowling on saturday nights.  They have a package for 6 people for like 65 bucks.. Includes your shoe rental and 2 hours of bowling.. oh, and a pitcher of soda.  The shoes are clean.  The bar is clean, the lanes are clean, and even the bathroom was clean.  Do not underestimate how much money a bar tab can be... 2 different friends racked up over 100 dollar checks in about 3 hours.. maybe 3.5..  Anyway, I liked this place and will return for sure... but maybe because I bowled 168 woot woot!
4 ||| A little hard to find but worth the effort.  Hint, its right behind the sleepy poet antique mall.  They have pretty much all the average home brewer would need.  Plus, knowledgeable people to help.  I hear they also have a warehouse in Belmont and can order pretty much anything else.  Highly recommned.
0 ||| This is by far the worst Roberto's in the area.\n\nIts the nearest one to where I currently live so we would go out of convenience. Being that it's a Roberto's the food is basically the same as anywhere else but for some reason getting what you actually ordered is a challenge. \n\nThey charge a $1.10 to add guacamole to an item and on 3 separate occasions I got home and they had neglected to add it even though I had paid for it. I initially shrugged it off and didn't want to get all bent about the situation but it definitely got on my nerves.\n\nThe next time I went in I made sure to tell them about the guac situation and this time they included it but still charged me despite their 3 past screw ups. I thought, alright fine it's just a dollar.\n\nA few days later we returned for breakfast burritos. Took the order home and they had put the wrong meat inside of one of them. I don't know how Carne Asada gets confused with Shredded Beef - and in a breakfast burrito nonetheless. Gross combination. \n\nAt that point it was clear that they are simply too incompetent to get a to-go order done correctly. A mistake or two is understandable but this is just ridiculous. It happened time after time, consecutively. I shouldn't have to babysit them while they make the damn food to make sure they are doing their jobs correctly. \n\nI have never had this issue at the other location I used to frequent and though it is a longer drive I will be going back to the old location. \n\nDon't waste your time and money on this Roberto's. They are sloppy and careless. They don't pay attention to what they are doing, especially at 1am when the place is dead and they aren't even busy (which is usually when we would go). No thanks.
1 ||| I came in and a waitress came to our table , took our order and then walked away. Another lady came to us and asked what we wanted , then the first girl came back and asked us again!!! The restaurant has 4 people. This is not good! Write it down you dumb blonde
3 ||| Good pizza ... I've only had delivery from them (a couple of times) ... the pizza was fine ... timely delivery ...
3 ||| We went here for drinks and a bite before a concert at nearby Byham theater. We had wings and a piece of cookies and cream cake. Both were outstanding. We both had the Fat Gary's Ale, but in hindsight I would have preferred a Guinness. The ambiance was suitably cave-like as a good bar should be.
4 ||| Despite other mediocre reviews by other Yelpers, I can only elevate my prior ratings.  Dinner tonight at Red Lobster was nothing short of fantastic.  Plenty of biscuits, fresh--super-fresh salads--albeit simply lettuce, grape tomatoes and red onion, but it was, I must repeat incredibly fresh and plentiful.  The fried shrimp platter was nicely done--no grease, light batter, medium sized baked potato and plenty of cocktail and tartar sauce.  The hubby ordered flounder which came with nothing less than 4 pieces along with his side order of broccoli.  I think the pricing at Red Lobster is right on point for what you get.  They don't gouge you.  The service provided by our server Katherine was perfect.  She presented herself as an attractive, polite young lady with a great smile.  Whoever trained her did an excellent job as she made our experience today at Red Lobster all the better.  Thank you Katherine.  Thanks to the management of Red Lobster who is doing a great job at making this restaurant an enjoyable place to eat.
0 ||| Bathroom was so grosss. Toliet paper every where dirt on the floor and even pee on one of the toliets. I looked on the bathroom check sheet and acording to there wasnt a bathroom check since 1200 and it was 9 at night. Bad service
4 ||| Almost always prompt, polite, service.  The prices are beyond reasonable, and the quality has never lacked.  I would recommend anyone (who does not want SUPER traditional decor and feel) try this restaurant.
0 ||| Even giving one star is too much for this restaurant.\n\nWe ordered fried shimp with eggs, saw it on the menu for $12.95 with rice. We told them we didn't want the rice, just the shrimp with eggs, they ended up charging us $17.95 for it, we confronted the staff and said that is a regular dish and not a rice plate and it costs that much.\n\nThe rest of the food were full of msg, the bbq pork was nasty tasting, the whole night, all 4 of us were drinking water none stop from the msg thirst.\n\nOn top of that, they charged us 18% tip added to the bill, for this calibre of restaurants, and for a table of 4 only, what right do they have to add the 18% tip to the bill? And cash only??!\n\nNever coming back and no one should come here either.
4 ||| Not the encore, but I like this place.  Plus I usually win, always a plus
4 ||| I have been able to experience both lunch and breakfast at Taylor's Cafe and on both occasions, both service and food were decent. The restaurant is tucked between some small clothing shops, The Eggery, and next to AJ's. The parking is not desirable especially during the lunch hour as the restaurant is sharing the lot with three restaurants and the grocery store.\n\nThe restaurant is small with few small tables, shared booth seating, and some outdoor seating. The decor is bright with exaggerated art work of Jazz performers. Apparently, the restaurant used to have some live Jazz music in the past. It is a very cute place.\n\nFor lunch, I had one of the chicken sandwiches which was good. However, I thought the options for breakfast were better. You could either choose one of the specialty omelets or build your own. I had the lox omelet which was excellent with hash browns. I was interested in the country potatoes however the waiter had mentioned that other tables had sent back the potatoes and that the hash browns would be better. Still unsure, he let us sample the country potatoes which were decent. I actually liked the country potatoes over the hash browns, I thought it was nice that the server was interested in making sure that we were satisfied. And overall, we all were. My guest ordered a build your own omelet with chorizo and another guest ordered the waffle with fresh fruit and both looked good and were highly complimented. The server was open to providing separate checks (however I am not sure that he would have been so willing if the place was packed which it wasn't). There was a random To-go iced tea delivered to our table and our check had originally not charged for our coffees but then after separation, had charged. These few incidents of confusion were masked by the overall pleasant service, atmosphere and quality of the food. I will definitely be back and would recommend Taylor's as a great breakfast/brunch location.
3 ||| Living here for the last two years has been nice. The grounds and staff are wonderful. Rent is pretty reasonable for Scottsdale. The only drawback is the fairly consistent water repairs causing water to be shut off for the whole day.
1 ||| A poor substitute for Tex-Mex food. Uninspired and bland food choices. Seems to be typical for Champaign-Urbana :(
4 ||| Being apart of  the Darden company I knew what to expect which was great service. My family received just that. Ashley was our server and she was awesome. Our food was nice and hot and was on time. Thank you Longhorn family!!!
0 ||| OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  \n\nPlease, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  \n\nYou know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.\n\n  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.
4 ||| Why 5 stars?\n\nFreakin' awesome Mexican food, and CRAZY cheap prices!\n\nSo, I went a bit overboard (as always) in ordering.\nI just wanted to try so many different thingsssss\n\nI got:\nCheese crisp with green chile strips and guacamole\nMini green chile chimichanga\n1 cheese enchilada\nSide order of refried beans\nChips and salsa\n\nAll that food... .$15\nAnd it ended up being way too much food.  WAY too much.\n\nI loved everything...\nEVERYTHING I SAY!\n\nAnd that's truly a rarity.
1 ||| Excellent customer service, but the breakfast I had was disgusting. The manager was super funny and really sweet. I just had to sit down and eat the whole thing. The egg kind of tasted like rubber, the cheese was pretty gross, and the bagel had my breath smelling like garlic until I went home from work and got the chance to brush my teeth.
3 ||| It is what it is. Cheaply made foreign tools at a cheap price. There are a few deals if you know where to look. Their hand tools, (sockets, wrenches, ratchets, etc.) have the same lifetime warranty as Sears and some of the others at a fraction of the cost. I've never had one fail, but I understand some do. Customer service is acceptable, but not impressive. Good selection.
2 ||| Honestly, this is the same as most any other bar. This one falls to the pub style rather than the disgusting bump and grind style. Good place to get a table and hang out. \n\nAn extra star because they sell playing cards for a buck. Really cheap, awful, uncoated, unshufflable, undealable, soak up beer faster than any paper I've ever seen playing cards, but playing cards all the same. My friends and I aren't smart enough to bring our own, so this saves us. But they lose a star for having recently eliminated the internet jukebox and added a DJ. How else can we play \"In the Air Tonight\" to kill the mood at 1am? We actually paid the dude a fiver and left him an iPod to get something played that wasn't part of the standard littany of horrible bar songs.
2 ||| Pretty good wings, but the beer selection is trapped in the 90's (or maybe the 80's).  In an era where you can get a serviceable IPA in any generic chain restaurant in town, this place is relentlessly hop-free.  For the love of god, it's time for a change. The Four Peaks truck is already dropping off Kilt Lifter...how about adding Hop Knot. Or Odell IPA, Stone IPA, or even just Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.\n\nUpdating to three stars because now they have Hop Knot on tap!
0 ||| So disappointing. Not only did the service take forever, the meat was dry, the corn was dry, the buns were dry. It's unfortunate. Last time we were here, it was great. Not sure what happened, but we won't be back.
2 ||| Me and my fella are in need of a new sofa and we headed to every furniture store I could think of. This place is nothing to write home about. One of the lesser Ashley stores I've been in. The selection wasn't amazing, but they have a good amount of discounted merchandise, which is a plus. The layout of the store is a little shabby. I think a few more decorative details would do wonders. \n\nI probably wouldn't make another trip all the way to that side of town, but it's good if you're in the area.
1 ||| The best thing I can say about this hotel is that the staff was friendly. The hotel room wreaked of cigarette smoke and looked like there had been a bar fight resulting in a hole in the bathroom door. The breakfast provided was mediocre.
0 ||| This place used to be really awesome back in the day. Now it sucks. Maybe others are better but this location is no bueno.
4 ||| Contrary to the experience some of my friends may have had at this classy lil joint, I had a BLAST! Hahaha. Perhaps it was due to the excessive amount of vodka they put in their vodka cranberries, or all of the good music they played, or how HOT one of the dancers was... anyway, my point is: I will be back. Someday. I will find a reason.\n\nI won't reveal too much about this place because I think the mystery of what it might be like is part of the appeal... but it's totally harmless, and everyone here was really fun. Not too dirty or creepy. It was entertaining and silly. About 10 of my friends and I brought our friend here for her bachelorette party. It was definitely a night she'll never forget!
0 ||| In all honesty, I LOVE NORDYS! And I do LOVE MAC. But,.....................\nover the weekend, on sat. evening I decided to trade in some of my 20 plus back to macs. When I arrived at the counter, It was very busy as always :) They really need a stand lone, MAC store in this mall. So a girl walks up and asks if I need help. I say yes, I have some back to MACs that I would like to recycle and I would like to look at blush and lip gloss as well. I had a list of colors I wanted to try. She helped line up all the colors for me. I asked if I could try them on and she cleaned them for me and told me they were good to try now. I must say, I have NEVER had a MAC girl not offer to put it on for me, NEVER. Then as I was doing it myself, a \"friend\" of hers is across the way and she was asking them, are you in a hurry, blah blah blah, and I could see her facial expressions in the close by mirror. She was NOT your nomral MAC girl. She was horrible, very bad customer service. I love MAC products, I have tons of it. I never leave a MAC counter without something new, its too irresistible and I think for department store make up the prices are very reasonable. But yesterday, I did leave empty handed ad I didnt even trade in my recycles. So thumbs down to MAC this weekend. Too bad for them, I will not be back to the MAC counter for a long while. So in all honesty, I must say NORDYS overall is a 5 and MAC usually is too but NOT today! :( Very disappointed bc I was well prepared for what I was looking to recyycle and purchase. Thumbs down!
0 ||| My wife and 3 family relatives dined here tonight. We sat ouside by the heaters where we were aware live entertainment was provided. 3 of us ordered the \"Grandma Jo's lasagna\" on the basis of our waiter's recommendation that it was like a \"slice of heaven\" The other entrees were the salmon while my wife had the penne pesto. The time to wait for a waiter to take our drink orders, take our meal orders, and any follow up were completely absurd and disrespectful. By the time 4 of us had nearly completed our meals, my wife's penne pesto finally arrived after 2 requests for service. \n\nBy the way, NO Italian bread, olive oil or butter EVER placed on the table up front EVEN when we requested it. HELLO??? Anyone listening??\n\nFolks, I have LIVED and WORKED in Italian restaurants in NYC, grown up in Italian neighborhoods throughout NYC and dined up and down the boot in Italy. The preparation and the serving of food is a sacred RELIGION. It better be of high quality and the service even better.\n\nIn my entire life I never have experienced a more miserable and disrespectful dining experience. The young male waiter was awful and incompetent. Requests for the manager were neglected and when she arrived, she was basically aloof. Any dignified restauranteur worth their salt would have been apologetic, provided a few discounted meals, and desserts for all. A meager dessert to ONLY my wife was mentioned. 30 minuteds later, nothing!! \n\nThe \"slice of heaven\" lasagna you ask? Very poor texture, limp and served cold. Good thing my folks are dead cause if they were alive, or if this place was situated in NY, there'd be LOUD complaints. But here in Arizona, we are fed crap and are too embarrassed to say anything. If you owners were too busy to accomodate the dinner crowd cause of some festival earlier in the day, well then you need to HIRE more attendants and FAR more competent ones than what I saw tonight.\n\nIn Italian we have an  old Neapolitan saying about a place like Kokopelli Winery that when you leave you know you'll never go back or recommend to anyone again: \"La Croce Nera!!\" Translation: The Black Cross!!!
4 ||| I have been there for the buffet and it was delicious and very varied: the morros y cristianos, arroz con pollo, pork, ropa vieja, pescado to name just a few.\n\nThe food seems very authentic (better that other  Cuban restaurants I have been to). The deserts are excellent too.\n\nI will definitely eat here again, whenever I will come back to Vegas.
3 ||| Having grown up in Mesa, I've been here many, many times. The last time I was here was 15 years ago when I was in high school. Tonight I brought my husband and kids.\n\nThe place literally has not changed in all these years. It's crazy! Like a time capsule! These lose a star for me because of their totally antiquated POS system (ok it's not even that, it's a manual old school cash register). It's CASH ONLY. I mean seriously? Also, you have order your pizza in one line and get your drinks in another line, and pay separately. It makes absolutely no sense!\n\nThey also lose a star because the pizza is terrible. I mean just awful.\n\nOk now that the gripes are out of the way...we had a blast! My kids were all smiles, laughing and dancing the whole time. They were fascinated the the huge organ and all the bells and whistles. The dancing cats, the bubbles, the lights! The kids LOVED it! The organist was really good. He played a stunning version of Phantom of the Opera that I loved.\n\nWe got the kids ice cream which was only $2 each. Not bad.\n\nBottom line the entertainment is great, the venue is very casual and super family friendly. It's a great time with the fam. But maybe I'll just get a salad next time.
3 ||| I reserved a RT service for my sisters bachelorette party to be picked up when we arrived and for the return. \nThe pick up was great he had my name displayed and was very helpful with our luggage. I don't remember his name but I'm horrible at remembering names. Some how he managed to fit all 6 of us women's luggage into his trunk, and we don't travel light I might add. Also, he was helpful in getting my other sister, who was to arrive at a later time that day, a earlier service than reserved for her. Even though we were running a tad bit late and we just told him last minute that there would be 2 hotel stops instead of one, he didn't mind at all. Overall airport to hotel was great. OH did i mention the bottle of champagne we managed to finish at 9am? \n\nFor the ride back was just as pleasant. I had reserved a stretch limo originally but they didn't have any available at the time of my pick up, so they showed up with a stretch Cadillac Escalade Limo! I wasn't even mad :) . The driver Ralph Z was very nice and attentive. I only remembered his name because he gave me his card. Any ways, he gave us great conversation the whole time and understood us (but us I mean me) being a bit ill that day, so we made the ride as smooth as possible. He even took pictures for us by the limo and told us we needed to pose and everything. I enjoyed the ride.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience to and from. Presidential Limousine is a great place to reserve your services at. I'm never taking a bad cab ride again! I will definitely being using PL again.  Hope I was helpful enough.
3 ||| Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok.\nI had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didn't make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option. \nNow I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten.\n\np.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak.
4 ||| As soon as I walked into this place, my mouth began to water.  The aroma in here just cant be beat.\n\nI ordered the special - 1 16\" pizza with 2 toppings and 30 wings.  Pizza toppings were Mushrooms and Onions.  I lamented this topping combo, but it was what my girlfriend wanted.  I got the wings hot, also ordered the Calzone sampler to try it out.\n\nWhen I opened the wing box, the steam that rose from the box made my eyes and nose water.  It smelled so good I had to eat one right there at the counter.  One of the owners told me that the wings are even better if you eat them in house.  The next time I am in the area, I will try it out.\n\nI took the pizza home and cracked open the box.  The mushrooms were thick, and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand.  The sauce was rich, and the crust was perfect.\n\nThe calzones were great as well, smothered in marinara sauce.\n\nThe price was great, the people were friendly.  The lunch special can't be beat.  (2 slices of pizza and a free soda, 50 cent refills)\n\nNegotiate the construction outside, find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza.  My only regret was that I had to share it.  Next time - its all mine.
3 ||| OK, OK... I'm giving a Chinese takeout a 4 but pay attention why...\n\n1. Very fast and efficient service... when the belly begs for food they are ready!\n\n2. The food is pretty darn good... the string beans are fresh and perfectly cooked, the tofu nicely browned (NOT mushy), sauces are AOK but just that.\n\n3. I wouldn't go there to eat in their lil' eating area but it says EXPRESS on the sign!!! \n\n4. The real reason for a \"4\"? I'll be back there every time I want quick Chinese... there!
3 ||| This place is good! Even with the restaurant being busy we got our food out pretty quick. The portions are great and you can't beat the prices, we had a large group with a couple of separate tickets 4 on each ticket and no one paid over $30 you can't beat that! You get free ice cream with your meal which is really good and the service is super friendly and welcoming!!! We had a great dinner out! The only problem we had was having to hear a table very loudly complain about EVERYTHING the staff was so professional, I would of tossed them out, but they handled it very well, and once they left we enjoyed the rest of dinner! You can't please everyone. They definitely gained a couple return visitors from our party!
0 ||| I have given this place several chances and time after time to keep letting me down. It seems that I never get a complete wash their spots all over the windows smears on the glass. I don't expect a complete detail for $17 but I do expect at least a good wash
2 ||| HFFA is a year round gym and aquatics center.\n\nPros:\n\n-No shortage of lanes for swimming.  When the pool is arranged for 25 yds, there are 6 member lanes available. When the pool is 50m, there are a minimum of 3 lanes available.\n\n-New equipment.  As of January 2014 all of the weight machines have been replaced by top of the line machines.  HFFA also expanded the cardio area to include countless ellipticals, treadmills, and stationary bikes.\n\n-Open at 5am weekdays, open relatively long hours on weekends.\n\nCons:\n\n-The new equipment comes at a cost.  HFFA got rid of almost all the free weights.  That means no benching, squats, preacher curls, roman chair, or Captain chair.  This is a dealkiller to some, and I go to HFFA for the gym portion far less often now.\n\n-Old building.  It was just renovated in Jan 2014, but it does not feel any newer.\n\n-Pool is inconsistent in temperature.  the circulation of the pool seems strange, as one corner is noticably warmer than the rest of the pool, and the water temperature is a bit cold compared to pools I frequented in the past.
2 ||| First off:  I'm a picky eater, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nOkay, I'm not from pittsburgh.  I am not overweight, not a hipster, not on any of the plethora of drugs, I own my own home,  Probably most of all, I've never heard anything about this place before walking in, so I had no idea what to expect besides \"Lets get breakfast.\"\n\nIf you are the opposite of any of these points, this place is probably worth a try for you.\n\nWe had a horrendous wait, but I think that was a complete fluke:  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekend...I don't think anyone with less than 3-4 had that long of a wait at all.\n\nThe waitresses are ornery, but not rude...just clear.  They aren't going to make nice or kiss your rear, they're not there for that.  I found this respectable, and liked it.\n\nBut the food?  Oh God.\n\nPros:  Portions are massive, all the other reviews will tell you that.\n            1) Prices are reasonable, cheap even, but I suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato.  Seriously...I think I had at *least* three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone.\n            2) ....uhm.  ....  Nothing was dry?\n\nCons:  There was no color anywhere.  Absolutely everything on every plate I saw in the place was some blend of beige.  Potatoes, egg white, pancake, sausage...after you tilted the whatever-grease-that-was out of your dish, everything was the same color.  \n             Half my dish was potato.  \n             The egg was not over-medium, it was still-runny, even the whites.  I presume this was because they were slammed, and didn't have time to cook what were almost certainly factory-chicken eggs.\n             The sausage was not identifiably sausage.\n             I had my entire day's required calories in butter alone on the toast.\n             There was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu.  Nothing raw, nothing green, nothing fresh, not even as an ingredient. Even McDonalds has a fruit cup, ffs!  TACO BELL has better quality food!\n             \n\nTake one look at the clientele when you walk in.  It attracts exactly the kind of people you would picture in a dingy greasy-spoon truck-stop.  If you are not one of those people, Do Not Bother, this place makes Denny's look classy.
0 ||| I agree with \"Jane D\" below 100%.\n\nSum it up: Horrible Service + Rude Cashier/Server = Never going back again.\n\nI used to order take out quite frequently via a nice female on the phone. Upon ordering, I was surprised an abrupt male speaker hurried me for an order, after agressively asking if I knew what location I was calling. I struggled to forget his rude manner on the phone, but sadly the offenses stacked up when I came in to pick up my order. 1) He became pissed when I questioned why I had only one soup with my Lunch Special order (I had ordered 2 lunch specials on the phone). 2) He was annoyed I came in wanting to add sushi last minute (heaven forbid I give them more money). 3) He thanked other patrons as they walked out the door, but said nothing to me, even when I politely said \"Thank you\".\n\nThe food is satisfactory. Sad to say, I have been going there out of habit and failed to venture out to other Sushi places in the Anthem area. Now, I have my prompt to do so.\n\nBottom Line: Avoid this place. I would rather tolerate bad food than blatant disrespect.
3 ||| For Charlotte this is a decent dim sum restaurant, of course places like Atlanta, Philadelphia and the west coast will have better place with a larger Asian population. But this is pretty decent. The location is hard to find and for many they will find the location a little sketchy. But I assure you the food is good and it's authentic Chinese, not the crappy \"American\" Chinese that we're all use to. Come on the weekends in the morning for the dim sum cart. If not they do take orders for them throughout the week.
1 ||| I keep waffling between 2 and 3 stars--2.5 is appropriate. Banfield is to pets what Nextcare is to people. They're available when you can't get into your regular healthcare doc and will allow quick turnaround on service at a decent price. \n\nThe issue I'm having is their immediate upsell on tests and \"extra's\" and also when it comes to vaccinations and medication. In today's economy, I can't believe that Banfield would put such a hard sell for unnecessary items like they did with me on the last two visits. People don't have a lot on extra money to throw around--that's why they're coming to Banfield in the first place, right? \n\nOur last visit my dog Fezzy had an eye infection and his vaccinations were due so I asked for a price quote. The first step was to upsell me on tests (allergy tests, skin tests, etc) and then also to upsell me on the vaccinations and give him more than just Rabies and Bordatella. There was a shot for parvo (seriously? thought that was just once when they were puppies) and one other disease I didn't remember. \n\nAfter the vet examined Fezzy the tech came back and listed 5 medications for him, everything from an anitbiotic, an analgesic, an eye wash, an eye ointment and an allergy pill. Total bill was to be $465. I scrapped the vaccinations (can get them done at the Phx Spay/Neuter Clinic for much cheaper--$40) and all the extra tests--and when I was looking over the needed meds I noticed that the eye ointment was listed at $84.99! For a tube of triple antibiotic eye ointment. Essentially we're looking at spending $85 on a tube of neosporin. I was shocked! The tech said that the vet could give me a presricption for that one to take to my pharmacy if I felt it was too expensive. I immediately agreed.  I took the rest of the meds and with the appointment the total came to $105. \n\nHere's the kicker--I called 1800PetMeds--the price for the ointment: $35.99 plus shipping--oh it gets better! I called CVS on 7th Street--$24.99 but they'd have to order it. It gets even better than this---So I dropped it off at CVS on 16th and Camelback and went to pick it up in the afternoon--price was $15.99! A whole $70 cheaper than Banfield! Can you believe that markup??? \n\nStaff was friendly--everything else was alright--just watch their pricing and look over the details of your bill. Ask the question--are these necessary and does my pet really have to have that? Oh---your regular pharmacy can fill almost all pet medications. Check with them first--you'll keep some of that hard earned money in your pocket!
4 ||| I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Church Brew Works. The collapse of the steel industry in Pittsburgh left quite a few parishes without a congregation and led to the creation of this very unique brewery. How often do you get do drink beer in a church? The fermentation tanks are literally at the alter. Something about the combination feels so wrong that it is right.\n\nApart from the atmosphere, the beer here is great stuff. Grab a sampler to try them all, each had its merit. It's looks like you can grab growlers and mini kegs as well. Certainly worth checking out.
4 ||| Truly one of my favorites, cheap and perfectly flavored, its always busy so you know its good, the combo with a couple extra meatballs, is a home run.   Add  Hot sauce and some other combos on the table..whalla...Fah  as in PHANTASTIC!
4 ||| Excellent service. Very knowledgable and friendly. I would def come back again or recommend them to others. Thanks discount!
3 ||| Miley did my nails and I was super impressed with how accurate she was and how she went back and wiped all the sides and under my nails. Usually there's just a tad but of polish on the cuticles & what-not but not this time. If have to say that was the best gel mani I've ever had.
2 ||| Sometimes you just want to go to a BAR!  This is not the place to be seen or anything - more of a place to kick back with some reebs!\n\nPool table, shuffle board, golden tee, and it has a seperate restaurant if you want to sit in a booth.  \n\nIt is normal bar food, good hamburgers & they have the seasoned fries too (nice and crispy).  Service is usually pretty good.\n\nHappy hour....drum roll please...........$1.50 draft beers & $5.00 pitchers!!!  What?  Watched an entire laker v celtics game and it was $20 between 3 peeps!!!
2 ||| Nothing outstanding here. Portions are a good size. Lots of variety to choice from. Staff doesn't seem to leave behind the counter. There's a small salsa bar but nothing to fuss about. I've had the fish tacos which were a little bland. Same for the chicken burritos, not much flavor. Not sure why I expected this place to be good, bigger menu than del taco but not much on taste. If you're hungry and need a quick bite I guess it'll do.
3 ||| 4 for atmosphere, 3 for food and service\n\nI found this place on Yelp for dinner last night and my friend and I hung out in our care a few minutes before they opened at 5pm. We were quickly seated and we took a look at the HH menu and figured out what we wanted. We shared an order of the shrimp tempura, and I had a California roll and spicy tuna roll and my friend had a Vegas roll and rainbow roll. Our server was very nice, but the time between his stops at our table and how the food came out was really long. It took probably 10 minutes for our appetizer to come out, and then from the first sushi roll coming out, it probably took another 10 minutes to get all 4 of our rolls on the table. They weren't overly busy, but it looked like food was coming out to different tables at different times which seemed strange. My rolls were okay - nothing mind blowing. While I waited a lot, I was fascinated by a little private room they have in the back which was super cute and chic. The restaurant has a very NY vibe to it. I'll probably return
0 ||| My family has ordered from this bakery for OVER 20 YEARS- POSSIBLY 30?! Well, in the past 9 years or so, I have seen their quality rapidly go further and further downhill. Worse and worse quality to the product, declining taste and poorer ingredients are plainly evident. Sloppier and sloppier decorating, ruder and ruder counter staff.\n\nWe have continued to shop there simply due to the location being convenient, but these days you are really TAKING YOUR CHANCES as to whether the items you buy from them will be somewhat tasty or TOTALLY INEDIBLE. Still, I try to support neighborhood businesses as much as possible so it does break my heart to trash them in a review like this, but these things need to be said.\n\nThey continue to have a lot of customers due to their location and due to people remembering how good they USED TO BE, so when folks are back visiting their old neighborhood, they return to this bakery for the memories. But oh, how the standards have fallen!\n\nWe got some cupcakes for a party last year in November that we literally could not eat, they were so dry and bad- they went in the trash (not cheap either). Thank goodness it was just a small kiddie birthday get-together and not an important occasion with guests I would have been embarrassed in front of.\n\nWe considered getting our wedding cake from them (again, in order to support a neighborhood place) in 2008 but they gave us such a hard time regarding even getting an appointment for a cake consultation that we went with another baker, out in the west end. Looking back, I am glad it happened that way.\n\nAs for daily items, their breads are usually decent and their donuts are edible (not great, just satisfactory) but have way too much sickly-sweet frosting. Cookies are usually fine but sometimes their cake decorating is clearly being done as such a rush job that it's sloppy beyond description. Danishes and many other items give the impression that something went sort of wrong with the recipe, items are heavy and greasy when they should be fluffy or flaky or soft and moist. Items seem overcooked or undercooked. I wonder if they ever really taste test what they are producing. Also I don't know how they get away with serving such pathetic cannolis in an Italian neighborhood- pastry cream and zero ricotta, plus just in general- funky ingredients that are blantantly, obviously pre-fab, no fillings seem freshly made, it's all out of some mass-produced tube. And for this low quality, they make you pay premium prices, OF COURSE!\n\nNothing is marked with price or name of the item, and when you ask, most of  the counter staff consistently take a disgusted tone with you and treat you like you are stupid, rolling their eyes at you (the only exception being the youngest girls that work there, in their early 20s, who are consistently very good at being polite when helping customers). The more mature ladies frequently say snarky things to me like: \"That's not a cinnamon SPIN, that's a cinnamon DONUT. That's not a DANISH, that's a FRUIT PASTRY.\" If you don't want to have to answer questions, then put up labels and tags with the names and prices and info, so customers can read what terms you are expecting us to use!\n\nMost recently, I picked up a birthday cake for my father's birthday, and it looked like a child decorated it. Seriously. I could have done a better job myself. Maybe they are employing the cheapest bakers and decorators rather than the more talented ones. If this is the case, it certainly shows.  \n\nI think I am DONE with continuing to try to support this \"neighborhood landmark.\" Any time you complain, it seems to do no good-- they do not see the need to heed customer comments and improve.
0 ||| Worst Walgreens ever.\nI was new to the area and passed by this place, I had to go to the bathroom\n as well and figured I'd stop in here.\nI walked to the back and saw that the door could only be opened by an employee because there was pass code door lock.\nWent to the cashier, asked if I could use the bathroom.. She looked hesitant and was silent for a long period of time before I said, \"I'm planning on buying stuff\". She still seemed dumbfounded and couldn't give me an answer, the pharmacist who was going on break, overheard our conversation and opened the bathroom for me.\nWell the bathroom was disgusting and reeked of pot, I thought I was in a Cheech and Chong movie.. I wanted to die!  Not only was the smell of weed overpowering and disgusting, but I think me using a porta potty would have bad better accommodations. I'm surprised I made it out alive.. Gagging and everything.\nI bought my crap and booked it out of there..\nHorrible location.. I'm surprised my car didn't get stolen either. But really..? For the bathroom to smell of pot and it's locked with a pass code that only employees know? What's that say about your employees? They have to light one up to get through their horrible work day at walgreens? \nYou sure are hiring some winners..\nUgh.. Never going there again..
2 ||| After visiting some GREAT dive bars on this Las Vegas trip . . . this one left us wanting so much more . . . the bar was packed with regulars . . . and the drinks came quickly and were reasonably priced.\n\nWe were ther at shift change . . . and when the change was complete . . . 3/4 of the bar left . . . not quite sure why . . . becasue the service seemed to stay the same . . . it just left us wanting more.\n\nOne last thing . . . if you are going to make a shrine to you favorite football team . . . you might want to move it away from the front door . . . unless you only want to attract those fans.\n\nOn the fence as to whether or not a return trip will occur.
0 ||| Worst lounge to ever goto. Bartender couldn't even figure out my age arlfter I had showed her 4 ids from 4 different states. The bar stinks like drugs and garbage. People are low lives and are rude as well as the bartender. How professional is it when a bartender asks you if you know where to get cocaine? Be careful of the low lives stealing beers, drinks and personal items fom you when you are not looking. Worst bar ive ever been too. The staff are far from professional.  They will never have my buisness again and I would encourage anybody never to step foot in this dump. Dont even get me started at all the bugs and roaches roamimg around the floors and pool tables. I would never ever recommend this bar to anybody. I also forgot about all of the underaged kids who hang out get drunk and be obnoxious. I cannot stress how much this bar needs to be investigated and shut down. What bar allows underage kids to run around the bar and get obnoxious drunk? Overall experience: very unprofessional,  dirty environment (bugs),  underage kids, very very poor customer service. This bar is a scrubby place to goto. Very very unprofessional.
3 ||| This is a nice alternative to a sit down restaurant. I actually appreciate getting my own chips and salsa! I recommend the machaca burro, and my husband loves their chile relleno. The price is reasonable, and the staff are friendly. I would like to give it 5 stars.\nHowever they switched to paper plates, which sweat, and they no longer have their great margaritas. Try this little place, worth the trip.
2 ||| Very overrated, in my opinion. I'm assuming it's getting high marks because of the focus on some low-country food. Atmosphere is not that unique, elevator music. Food is fine, if not spectacular. Service was innattentive, not-very-knowledgeable. Alot of better options uptown.
0 ||| Ahh!! Another one... another in the corner quick! yup that was my stay at the hilton. I thought that it would be funny to some of you fellow yelpers to paint a picture, \n     Towering above all others at 6'6\" there I stand a tribute to the modern man ( I like to open with a joke.) There I stand on a swivel chair batting spiders away like the late Joe Dimaggio with a \"enjoy your stay\" book. I must of taken out 13 spiders that night. Nasty. I personally very much dislike spiders above all other creatures. I mean if a panda was hanging in the corner of my $600/a night room (yeah they think that just because they have a college in their town means that they are north Chicago or west New York or something.) I would be all right with the bear, I might even throw him a waffle or something. \n\nAll in all,  When the person at the front desk asked me how my stay was, I asked \"have you ever seen Arachnophobia?\" just stay away from this overpriced cave of a hotel. It was that bad of an infestation.
3 ||| I've been attending Meck for almost 4 years and its great. There are multiple service times and locations. You can be as involved as you want and the Meck institute offers many classes the help you learn more about the bible and take your faith to the next step. Also they offer Community Care classes for whatever your heart might need. I would suggest just giving it a try and see why so many keep coming back for more.
4 ||| I love this joint .. got nothing bad to say at all!  All of the wait staff are good but there a few that provide such GREAT service that you will be blown away.  AND get this, if you go a few times, some will recognize you and come to the table to see how you've been doing, even if you aren't at one of their tables.  Top that off with a creative menu and excellent execution and you've got one great date night!  I can't recommend this spot enough!
4 ||| This is my favorite steak restaurant in the WV, I've been here numerous times and love it every single time.    The idiots who don't like this place probably ordering salads.   If you like steak and burgers, u will love this place.   Great atmosphere and great food period.
1 ||| Not as good as I remembered. Sent the food back as it tasted off. Pies seemed a bit odd too. Frozen and defrosted? Texture wasnt quite right.
4 ||| Good Thai food here.  Had laarb kai, chili mint, and pad Thai.  All great dishes and made very well.  I'm a bit surprised that their main competition is across the street, lotus of siam.  Well, food here is definitely good and worth a stop.
0 ||| May have great food but I'll never know. Ordered delivery and the chef who doesn't speak English couldn't find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away. He said he was there but couldn't tell me where he was. Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldn't answer my calls back. Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful. The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and can't find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous. Don't use them for delivery ever, call the Breakfast Joynt. Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself. Plus, he actually knows the area. Cannot express my frustration with this restaurant's service. Do not use EVER
3 ||| nice and clean. pleasing n quiet
2 ||| Totally agree with the other reviews....hit or miss. Sometimes it's cute and sometimes it's not.
1 ||| Friendly bartenders and an interesting, diverse crowd.  But, as you would expect, it is as smoky as hell in here.  The drink prices at 6pm on a Wednesday were pretty steep, especially given the ambience. I wouldn't call $3.75 for a Corona \"cheap.\"  They were out of most of their tap beers.\n\nThe seat at the far end of the bar is reserved for some guy who has been coming to the bar for 12 years.  Has the bar even been around that long?  Anyway, if you sit there, the bartenders will ask you to move.  It's pretty much the only seat without a video poker machine.\n\nThey have some bar pool tables at the front.  Typical video poker bar with some quirks.
4 ||| Delicioso!! This was the 1st time I had been to this location & 1st time my husband had ever had Pei Wei. \nThis location is much bigger & brighter than the one on Eastern. I like it.\nMy fave dish is Kung Pao chx ordered extra spicey :) yes they can do that. \nwonton soup is yummy too.. lett wraps very flavorful, not too big of a fan of their fried rice. Taste like too much soy sauce.\nLOVE the fresh veggies used in each dish.\nWill choose Pei Wei for chinese every time :)
2 ||| Excellent service.  Cocktail Sauce will clear the sinuses.   Steaks were cooked correctly but not up to par with the past.  Ordered a rib-eye, looked like a typical steak from Golden Corral.  Dessert was excellent.  They gave us a free dessert since it was our \"date night\".  Very local in flavor. Southern Hospitality to the core.  Would go back in a heart beat.  Would not consider it worth the $100 for two, though.
4 ||| My wife and I always enjoy our meals at Blue. We had one of her birthday dinners, a new year's eve dinner, some get-together with colleagues, and it was a good experience every time. The food is great and so is the service.
3 ||| I appreciate this Wisconsin-based pizza chain. \n\nGlass Nickel is definitely an upgrade from the likes of Pizza Hut, Domino's, and even Papa John's. As such, the pizzas are also more expensive. I'd call it semi-gourmet fast-food pizza. Their menu is relatively large. I like the spinach cheese bread here and their specialty pizzas aren't bad. \n\nI'd recommend ordering online as Glass Nickel always has coupons to print and coupon codes. You won't necessarily save much, but take what you can get, right?
3 ||| What can you say, it's a Barnes and Noble. 4 stars as the employees were quite friendly and helpful, not 5 stars as the store was a little dirty (a bit of trash on the floor, magazines on racks somewhat askew). Granted it was an hour before closing and they seemed to be a bit understaffed for the crowd that was in there, but overall a fruitful experience.
4 ||| Best massage I've had in the Valley...from Sierra! Will be back...
3 ||| Love this place.  Everything on the menu is great.   BUT,  they keep it too cold and windy in there.   The ceiling fans are set for winter instead of summer and you have to dine with cold air blowing on you and your meal.  Not good trying to enjoy the food while being made uncomfortable.
4 ||| I was in an accident a few months back and USAA referred me to Gerber Collision, they had my car in and out, and painted perfectly. They replaced the rear bumper and passenger fender. The job was great and they patched my tire up for free! They were very nice and professional. They even gave me a ride to Enterprise Car Rental just as an added bonus. I will go to Gerber every time I need body work done. Hands down.
1 ||| Got there about 5:30 left at 7:00. Very slow service. Our waiter seemed to lose interest in our table when we didn't order cocktails or appetizers before dinner. We didn't see him much after that. Other staff took care of the table. We just wanted to eat dinner. The salads were good; my spouse upgraded to Classic Caesar, the waiter said it would be a \"slight\" extra charge. $4.00 is slight at the Stockyards. The 12 oz. Ribeye was good, but not worth $36, I've had better. My spouse ordered the salmon and our friend the walleye. The waiter disappeared for a long time leaving us sitting with empty plates waiting for the check. I'd thought about dessert and coffee, but it took so long for the waiter to come back we didn't order any. It was my Birthday, so it was kind of a special evening for us. Sorry we went to the Stockyards to celebrate. The last time we were there during the summer, the service was excellent. We won't be back, too many good restaurants in Phoenix.
1 ||| Regis at University Square used to be my backup salon, but since it was torn down and my usual salon was booked up, I decided to try the Regis Salon at West Towne.  \n\nThe salon was clean, the staff was polite and relatively speedy.  The stylist I had was very friendly and asked lots of questions, which was great and I thought I was happy with the cut until I got home and really got a chance to take a look at it.  She styled it very nicely, but I guess she just assumed that I would always want to style it exactly the same way, because as soon as I moved a hair it was a disaster area.  \n\nI asked for a layered collar-bone length cut with a bit of texture and long side bangs.  I ended up with bangs that were two inches longer on the right side of my face, hair an inch longer on the right side, completely blunt ends that were at least two inches below my collar bone.  I look like I had my hair cut by a one-eyed high schooler.  If I wasn't leaving town tomorrow I would go back in and demand they fix it. \n\nOnly giving two points because of the clean and friendly atmosphere and that one stylist put on Muse for awhile.  \n\nI'm sorry I didn't wait and go to Studio 924.
2 ||| This used to be on my very short list of \"favorite\" restaurants. Everything was perfect - except the Pad Thai (I am a traditionalist when it comes to Pad Thai and it's not realy Pad Thai at fate, the noodles and the sauce are wholly different).  \n\nThe crab puffs were amazing, the ambiance was clever and appropriately aloof/warm.  I even enjoyed the loud music next door, the bar was comfortable - and the scene was young and nutty.,  Loved it.  \n\nI am sad to see this place die out. I have NOT visited FATE since SENS opened up - I was hoping SENS and FATE would do some joint marketing and certainly there was enough interest for them to work as a team - but alas, FATE moved on without Jonny and that was a huge mistake.\n\nSee my review of SENS.  That place just keeps getting better and better.  I am addicted.  We go very often and enjoy everything about the people and the food.
4 ||| Yum. Thank you yelpers. I was so excited about trying this place, but was worried that my expectations would be too high after hearing all then praise. Luckily, this place is not overrated! \n\nPapaya Pad Thai, a delightful spin on traditional noodle dish. I don't think I ever want it any other way. The Tom Yum soup was so wonderful. These were my two favorite dishes. I've had better Duck Curry, but it was a solid dish nonetheless. Same for the Deep Fried Catfish with Green Chilies.\n\nI'll definitely be a regular here! =)
3 ||| While at Birds n' Beer last Thursday, I learned what \"riparian zone\" means. It is the strip between land and stream or lake. (Cue the \"The More  You Know\" clip)\n\nThe center itself is beautiful and great for a small - medium sized event. Lots of modern architecture and what looks like reclaimed materials. It's an eco-friendly building with great native landscaping.\n\nNow to the real part of the review: Bird and Beer is a great event, if you are free on a Thursday night between 5:30p and 7:30p. 5:30 to 6:30 is a chatting/snacking/drinking time with Four Peaks beer in a can. The lecture starts at 6:30 and is very informative. This month was reptile sex and last month was bird sex. The events are usually listed on the events section of Yelp, so check it out now.\n\nThe Center is easy to find. It is just south of the river on Central, with a sign posted on the road pointing towards the building and the parking lot.
0 ||| WARNING THIS STORE IS A FRANCHISE AND DOES NOT CONFORM TO ALL VERIZON STANDARDS OF SERVICE.\n\nI purchased a Verizon Gift Card to buy her new iPhone 5s for Christmas.\n\nWe decided to use the card as part of the upgrade and to get the data transferred between old and new device.\n\nOnce the upgrade agreement was signed we attempted to pay and very last minute they informed that they do not accept gift cards.\n\nWe disputed with them and their advisor then started to point the blame on us. \n\nthe service was rude, unwelcoming, unnecessarily accusative and very different from the service of an actual verizon store.
0 ||| Nauti-gal needs to get back to basics. Thoroughly clean the restaurant and focus on fresh, consistent, good quality food. The food is currently pretty nasty and not fresh at all. The atmosphere is pretty grungy, and the wait staff is surly. Not worth it. I won't be back.
2 ||| We stopped in for dinner after a Duck boat tour of Pittsburgh!\nWe were sat at a table right away, after a few min were greeted and ordered drinks and a app.  I then checked in on four square and was given a special offer for free fries, I asked about it and yes FREE !\nSo I order fries and we ll ordered of dinners.... My fried pork sandwich was out of this world good... But when the bill came the FREE fries were still on the check but my other half had already paid the check. :-(\nOn our way out 2 employees and a female manger talking at the hospo desk never said goodbye or asked how things were.... So food A but service and overall staff D..  Hospitality and service employees don't know what service really means anymore!
3 ||| It's an odd place -- a former brothel that's reputed to be haunted, with a lot of dark polished wood decor. In all the times I've been there, it's never once been crowded. It's very noirish, even in the daytime; the sort of place you'd go to watch horse races -- desperately, of course, on which you'd just bet it all. And the guy at the other end of the bar hasn't been home in years, and the ominous bartender has a Dark Secret, and you'd better keep your damn beak out of it!\n\nExcept the bartenders here are actually quite warm, and not ominous at all. In fact, they're more than willing to learn your preferred arcane beverage recipes. One guy there, Frank, actually keeps a little book of new recipes he learns from customers, which I appreciated quite a bit. I also really enjoy the appetizers here, especially the flatbreads and the bruschetta, which are probably the least noirish foods imaginable.\n\nSo, ignore your instincts about this spooky-seeming place and check it out. The entrees are not terribly impressive, but it's a great stop for an evening with other plans in it.
2 ||| I had an ok experience at MCN Studio.  I just moved to PIttsburgh from NYC and I relied on yelp to choose my hair salon.  I called MCN and asked to be seen by a senior stylist and the receptionist recommended Ashley.  I booked her for a cut and full highlight.  \nWhen I got there, I was pleased with the look of the salon.  It's trendy, clean, and has a good vibe.  I met Ashley and she was pleasant enough, although she seems a bit young to be a senior stylist.  But who am I to know what the credentials are to be considered \"senior\"?  She did a good job on the color and didn't do a terrible job on the cut, but I just wasn't wow'd.  She talked the entire time, which I don't typically mind and she's easy to talk to, but too much of the conversation was geared toward selling me product.  \nMy hair is straight and thin and I had previously gotten a stacked bob (which I hate and I'm trying to grow out).  She did her best to make it better, but it's still too stacked for my liking and is a bit uneven (found this out a week later when a different stylist was doing my hair for a wedding and fixed it).\nThe prices were a bit high for this area.  My haircut and highlight (she didn't do a full highlight, just partial which wasn't what I booked, but I didn't say anything so I'm somewhat to blame) came to $175.\nAlso, there was a lot of pressure to come back in 6 weeks.  I can't afford to get my hair cut and highlighted every 6 weeks and don't know anyone who goes that often.\n\nBottom line- my experience wasn't horrible and wasn't great. I will go back to give the salon a second chance, but will be trying out a different stylist.
2 ||| The fish was good. But not better than other places in Vegas that have much better service and atmosphere. I'm giving this a 3 because that's what it is--pretty mediocre. It was good, but not a notable sushi place.
2 ||| Grew up on east coast and miss NY style pizza after years in Minnesota. Crust doughy, sauce bland. Reminded me of Dominos. A crime to call this NY style pizza.  Never going back.
3 ||| We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!
4 ||| This place is good. If you are downtown in PHX and are looking for a place to get a good meal, not spend to much and either fight the crowd (during lunch time) or be alone (pre/post lunch time), this is the place.\n\nMore of an eatery than a deli, as I couldn't fathom ordering a half pound of ham with my order (actual delicatessens are rare out here). They do make a good meal and pretty quickly as well!
1 ||| You have got to be kidding me, $14 for a chicken breast, small at that, two wings and two sides! This was our second visit to Lo Lo's, the first being in the old location behind the parking lot, I don't think we will have a third visit, too costly for what you get and the quality of the chicken. The sides are good enough but I demand better value for my money.
2 ||| We got a coupon for this place so decided to try it.  We didn't expect much for $6.50 for a Sunday dinner.  The place was packed.  Some of the trays were empty when we went for the 1st plate.  The worker bees were busy. kept the place and tables clean.  Food was ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  The crab was a big hit except everytime I was up there, the tray was empty.  I'd rather pay a bit more and go to a place I like better.  For the money tho, it was average.
2 ||| Close about a year ago!
3 ||| Nice little cozy neighborhood market.  I was in the area and decided to drop by to check out what was fresh and get a drink.  From reading the other reviews I would've love to try their pizza.  The place reminds me of Dean & Deluca in a smaller package.  I usually don't eat sushi from markets but even their sushi looked appetizing.
0 ||| What an incompetent group of people. How hard is it to correct a last name and an address I've never even lived at???
1 ||| I ordered the Jasmine green milk tea with boba. It was very thick and had way too much milk. I wouldn't recommend getting their milk tea drinks.
3 ||| My check engine light was on and I was nervous to take it in here due to all the bad yelp reviews. 1st I was upset that the diagnostic fee doesn't go to the repairs if there was any. They took around 2hours to get a diagnostic, not bad compared to other places like Midas. What I needed to replace was a lot but Ken the customer service manager was so nice and took off the diagnostic charge completely, gave me a discount and when I picked it up later he also replace my spark plug that I couldn't afford with everything I needed free of charge. I was taken a back and just truly grateful for him. I recommend pepboys. They do care, and they don't push you to buy anything extra like other places. I also felt comfortable here, which does not happen often at the mechanics.
1 ||| I came here at least four times, so I don't think it's a one-time-deal.\nThe food here is VERY BLAND.\nMaybe it is because of the organic-ness of the ingredients, but I do not like this place.\n\nIt is a nice place to meet up with people who live on campus and such.\nBut I will rather go to other places on State.
2 ||| Saturday night. Opening weekend of Spring Training. 1 chef. Long waits between food delivery. \n\nAyce is limited in variety unless you really like California rolls. There are 5-6 different ones.
0 ||| I will always remember this place as the sight of the worst meal I ever had. I tipped 25% just so I wouldn't feel bad as I'm writing this. \n\nService was unsatisfactory. We were not offered a hello, a place to sit or even acknowledged for that matter.  When we finished our meal I was craving mochi but was instead brought the check by the other waitress. \n\nThe meal was a shitty bowl of seafood udon with overlooked, sparse muscles and inedible mixes of shrimp and octopus (both were overcooked and rubbery as well). I also had the worst spider roll to date. \n\nDo not eat here if you are seeking good, fresh and clean eating environment. \n\nEat here if you want to punish yourself.
1 ||| Compared to other places I've had surgery, the check-in process here is a lot slower.  When you're about to have surgery, you get pretty anxious and just sitting there waiting doesn't really help, especially when you don't get called in until less than an hour before the surgery is to start.\n\nAs far as everything else goes, things went pretty smoothly - what I remember of it of course.  The nurses were nice, and I felt like I was take care of.  If I had a choice, I don't think I'd come back here again but wouldn't mind it either.
3 ||| The Penguin by name is a Charlotte classic. Unfortunately we didn't go earlier before the original place closed down, and only had the opportunity to go under the current ownership. While I can't compare it to how it used to be I can say that it is currently a decent burger joint. Not the best in the area, but still offers a solid burger experience.\n\nThe place looks like a real dive on the inside and out, but it's more about the food than the ambiance (at least in my book.) The menu is a bit confusing since the one on the website is not the one same as what they give you in the restaurant, so if you saw something you liked online you will have to figure out it's new name listed on the restaurant's menu. Not a huge deal, but the least they could do is keep the website updated. I was surprised to see that they offered Stewart's Root Beer...something I haven't had since leaving New York almost two years ago. We each got a bottle of that delicious soda ($1.95) and enjoyed sipping on it while awaiting the arrival of our burgers.\n\nI ordered the Adelie burger ($7.95) and it was scrumptious. It's your basic \"Carolina\" or \"Southern\" burger in that it's topped with chili and cole slaw. The burger was a decent size and was delicious. The chili was a good chili and the slaw was crisp and tangy, bringing a variety of flavors to the overall burger. I had the sweet potato fries as a side and they were pretty dang good.\n\nMy wife ordered the King Penguin ($7.95), simply because she is a sucker for pimento cheese and fried pickles. She really enjoyed both on her burger. She tried to be a bit healthier and ordered the cole slaw as a side rather than some fries, but that didn't stop her from stealing a healthy portion of mine.\n\nFrom a standalone point of view (not comparing it to the \"glory days\") the Penguin is a decent place to grab a burger. They are not the best burgers around but still a solid joint. The fact that the menu isn't up to date with what they actually offer and the cold, drafty interior definitely take some points away. I'd go back if I was in the area, but living in Huntersville it's a bit of a hike for us. And with Bad Daddy's serving up better burgers less than five minutes away I doubt we'll return.
1 ||| A late night snack attack got the better of me and I wish it hadn't. Not because I felt like a shitty, horrible person for downing a thousand calories at night, I hadn't really eaten all day, but because \"The Baconator\", a so called premium sandwich, was blandanator. No flavor at all! My drink had flavor, however, just not the right flavor... I ordered a Sprite and what I got tasted like a mixture of Mountain Dew and a shitty explosion of limes. \n\nThe finale was being given drinks and no straws, as well as never being asked if I wanted any sauce to go with the chicken nuggets I ordered. \n\nNote to self,\n\nWhen you drive up and employees are screaming and acting a fool inside, keep on driving.
4 ||| This past January my furnace went out and I called Az Trademasters late in the afternoon and they came right out  to repair it. This was on the coldest day of the year and I had no heat! They got it up and running, it was a minor low cost repair. The technician was very professional. Hard to find good service companies anymore, but AZ Trademasters took care of me and my family. Thank you!
3 ||| Decent sports bar in the city. OK bar food and plenty of beers to choose from.\nService was always good.
0 ||| These girls that work there are so bitchy. They were so mean to my son. So unwelcoming! I will never ever bring my family there again! I thought they can manage a trim, a fade. It's not some high fashion salon! It's a cheap hair cut place! These girls need to go back to Cosmotology!
3 ||| We had these two young guys that seemed to be competing to take care of us, what a fun and great experience.  Cody and Marcus keep up the cool attitude and you probably deserve a raise...
2 ||| Almost no chicken in my Kung Pow Chicken.  I wish I could attach a photo to show the whole serving plate is still full after eating all of the chicken.  Special fried rice is good but, again, tiny shrimp & meat pieces.  Would be good if they stopped trying to save money/increase profits by skimping on meat in their dishes.
3 ||| As both myself, many friends and my boyfriend have all been servers in many establishments, we all tend to notice a bit more than your average customer. Not so much because we want to (sometimes it takes a LOT away from a dining experience), but because we were trained to. Generally, when I go out with my boyfriend we get lackluster service. I don't know if it's the combination of our 20-something age and generally casual appearance or the fact that we don't really try to ask much or seem to require attention. Either way, we've been searching for a decent place with attentive, but not obtrusive service that has good food absolutely NOTHING LIKE a chain restaurant. \n\nWe found it. \n\nI found Boudreaux's on yelp while searching for something, anything new. All the reviews were helpful and mostly accurate. We headed down there and it was easy to find. Parking nearby costs $3 if you're a pansy like me and don't feel like parallel parking a Buick. There's a little box that you shove some dollar bills into and I'm ASSUMING someone checks it, but who knows. Maybe it's just an honor system. \n\nWe sat in the front room behind the garage like door that connected one of the dining areas to the patio. It was open, the sun was beautiful, the breeze was nice. Once it got chilly, the server closed it. \n\nOur server was polite, but not stuffy, friendly, but not overly talkative. The best part of dining in a non-chain restaurant is that the servers are not under penalty if they don't immediately try to offer you 3 beverages, an appetizer and up sell the special. They're more inclined to tell you the special, trust you to READ the menu and answer any questions you may have honestly without sweating bullets because they have a mental checklist of things they HAVE to say. If so inclined they might tell you THEIR favorite, but it's not a forced speech. That is what we got. Perfection. Nothing forced, no worries on those pesky shoppers. \n\nThe Food: We ordered the Shrimp & Grits (couldn't resist) and the Shrimp Creole Rotini. I can honestly say the Shrimp Rotini was one of the best things I've eaten in years. There's an obvious bite to both dishes w/o overpowering the whole dish and both were served with delicious cornbread. Also, they have many different hurricanes, but we only tried the category five which was fruity, but strong and absolutely perfect. \n\nThe very next day I was craving some more Boudreaux. The atmosphere was so laid back, the food was so good, the service was so fantastic and relaxed, but on point. I ended up dragging along a friend, trekking up to NoDa and doing it all over again. This time we got the Gator Bites (delicious spicy mayo) and I was feeling the fried shrimp. Still delicious, still great service, still good hurricanes, still love it. \n\nMy boyfriend told me that that area (I'm still slightly new to Charlotte) didn't use to be so filled with funky little places and interesting restaurants. He said a lot of them fail too. When we asked our server how long they'd been open he told us ELEVEN years. Now that's what I like to hear. That means that without all the bells and whistles and fancy stuff, this place has survived solely because it has soul. Good management, I assume, great food and no pretense. It makes sense. \n\nI wish I lived right next door to this place. They'd get tired of me sitting there downing their delicious cooking, reading Creative Loafing and sipping on Hurricanes. I can't wait to try the Cajun Mary.
0 ||| What can I say...What a dump!\n\nI stopped in here for a quick lunch because it was convenient for a business stop I had to make, what a mistake. I started by quickly using the restroom which was down two dingy stairwells with no banister. Once I reached the bottom I was treated to the stench of fresh cigarette smoke, clearly the help couldn't act like humans and go outside. The bathroom was a disgrace, that's all I'll say about it but make sure you bring your anti bacterial hand sanitizer.\n\nThis should have been enough to walk out the door but I have a soft spot for diners and also it was 1PM, one hour after my daily feeding time. I bellied up to the counter and ordered a 1/2 Philly cheesesteak and onion rings (because I am still 7 months French fry free)!\n\nThe food was pretty ordinary and the diet coke was either being watered down purposely or the fountain was broken, either way it was gross. I finished my meal and tried to pay with AMEX, I was informed they did not take AMEX. I thought to myself...'I wonder if they have ever considered putting a sign on the door that says, oh I don't know, we don't take AMEX'? I paid and ran out of there with what little of my dignity I had left. I'll be visiting this place again sometime in Nevuary.
2 ||| Couldn't resist the price of eight bucks,  with the coupon code that came in the mail flyer, for a large pie with up to 10 toppings. And it was really easy to order online. That's where the good part ends.\n\nThe deal mentioned above was not good for delivery, so my husband went to pick it up. We had made a specific time for it to be ready for pickup, but he had to wait a few minutes - no big deal. Brought it home to my excited growling tummy...\nI had ordered it with \"robust tomato sauce\". We couldn't even tell if the pizza even had any sauce on it. Bleh. I had ordered the regular \"hand-tossed\" crust - but the crust was so salty and greasy it was almost inedible. We really like lots of toppings, but there was maybe one tiny piece of each topping on each slice, some with none at all. \n\nI miss the Dominoes that used to be close to our old house - they seemed to be able to make a much better pizza for some reason. I think if we do order Dominoes again (because the eight buck pizza is really tempting), we'll try another location.
3 ||| Being less prone to blathering on and on about every move or movement I take, I'm opting for the \"short and sweet\" approach. In a word, this place is as good as it gets! I have seen about 8 shows in the Ikeda Theater so far and I drool at the thought of going again if the right act is performing. I won't list the acts I've seen in order to not \"name-drop\" like many of you are prone to doing. Suffice it to say; ample parking, comfy seats, leg-room, impressive architecure and spot-on acoustics make this venue a true treasure. It does feel good to write this positive review in so few words, unlike those of you who need 3000 words to slam some struggling restaurant.
4 ||| OK, this is just wrong. The first review is from someone who's not from the area? People! Wake up! \n\nThis awesome candy store has many things a kid would love. I turned into one when I went at it. \n\nThings in it:\n\n1) The customizable M&M dispenser, so you can have your own choice in what color M&Ms you get. No more guessing! \n2) The Jelly Belly jelly bean dispenser, bins of M&Ms. I got a bag of toasted marshmallow, cotton candy, bubble gum and buttered popcorn. Words cannot describe how it was a cross between a big O, a big shadoobie and a horrible accident and I ended up in paradise (Willy Wonka version). \n3) They have candies I haven't seen in a while: chocolate coins, pop rocks, pixy sticks, wax lips, ring pops, salt water taffy. The list goes on! I gained a couple of pounds just typing this review up! \n\nSo, if you're in the area, and you heart heart heart candy, this is the place to go. Oh, and people of the Phoenix metro area, I better see some reviews when I get back here, or I will not be very happy. Okay?!?
2 ||| I went out with the hubbi this eve. Well I will say it could be better but it's just your typical random Applebee's ...ahhh...they didn't fix my drink right. In my Sir Charles Barkley voice it was terrible. Then I sent that back the first drink & took a picture of the 2nd drink. The over all service was two star worthy. But I'm feeling gracious tonight so a 3 is what I will give them. Should u view my pictures you will see I had shrimp & salad. Will I return hmmmm I guess. (Rolls my eyes) they could have done better.
3 ||| After an 8 hour flight from Philly, I could have gone to Venice in that am out of time, and arriving at the hotel nextdoor. Which is very tired and needs a backhoe for its next make over. This place was the highlight. I got there about 11:45, nobody in the place.  I had the fish and chips,$8 about half what I would pay back east. And to my surprise it was very good. Everything was hot and fresh, tarter sauce was very good. Great place for that after hours snack!
1 ||| Because this Panera is located in the heart of Oakland it is always crowded with students on their laptops or reading or just hanging out. It is actually more spacious than it appears but it's still always crowded. Prices keep going up while portion sizes keep getting smaller.
1 ||| I just recently found out that you must bring your paperwork with you every time you get your jewelry cleaned. After they clean it, they sign your paperwork to show that you've been getting your jewelry checked and have been taking care of it. If you don't have them sign it and a certain amount of time passes, you lose the warranty and can't get anything replaced if you lose something! I really wish someone would have told me or my husband. The first time I was asked for my paperwork was a couple months ago and I was finally given an explanation after I asked why they were suddenly asking for my paperwork. Womp womp... loss of one star for not telling me sooner :(
3 ||| I'm a regular to Pin Kaow on N. Rainbow and always get a good meal with great service.  The decor is fantastic and authentic, the food is excellent.  The Pad Thai lunch special is my staple dish and it is always tasty.   The curry dish with coconut milk is also very good, but more food than I can eat for lunch.
1 ||| Kiku ... maybe it's my fault that I used to love you, and now we're just friends. It could be that I ordered a measley eel/cucumber roll, and maybe you didn't find that fancy enough. Or a Philadelphia (that you so endearingly renamed Shadyside). In my Dynamite, you forgot my spicy mayo (maybe that's for the better, but you did kindly garnish the plate with a bit). \n\nAll three of my rolls, it seems you forgot some of the fish. It hurts my heart; your fish is so fresh ... when you put it in the roll, I enjoy it even more. I should've stuck to the Sushi Regular or the Chirashi, because those have been perfect in visits past. \n\nYour ginger dressing is still to-die-for, even though at $4 I feel a little portion robbed on the salad. And I'm wondering about the newest edamame fad - salt your own. Is this fad in fact, or faux paux? \n\nKiku is still my second-favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. But with the recent menu renovations, I'm wondering if they're trying to be a little 'more' than they should - it's quality sushi, in a good environment ... but the prices need to return to being justified.
1 ||| I love BWW. (see review under the galleria mall ring circle location) however upon going to this location the service was just weird. We had just gotten our appetizer, minutes later got our wings. Literally minutes later about 3 min. - she came by and asked us how everything was (typical, ok..) and then gives us the check.??? wtf??? are you serious? I havent even tried the wing yet, im still eating the appetizer you know we ordered.  And you're already asking me for the plastic?? \nKinda pissed me off. Then we rationalized she must be leaving. Nope.  I'd never go back to this location. But they get 4 stars for good food.
1 ||| I'll take my business to FedEx or the USPS after my experiences with UPS stores.\n\nThey are expensive, lack decent customer service, manager is rude and micromanages the staff.  Hello, if they can't do the task without your \"help\" maybe you shouldn't have hired them or maybe you need to alter your training program.\nWe have gone here merely for the convenience of the location(s) and have had to take business elsewhere for various reasons (purchasing stamps, mailing packages, etc.)\nMost recent visit, I arrived with a fax to send but a third customer that came in had hers sent first instead of waiting for mine.Had to wait for transmission receipt before they could send a new fax.   Business where my fax was being sent closed during the wait for the other customers fax and mine never went through.  Thanks for that.\nI have got to remember to stop going there.
1 ||| The guy in here sold me the wrong electrical adapters for South Africa. Had to buy different ones in Cape Town.  In addition, they park their stupid suitcase-laden car in the best space right in front of the store.
4 ||| Finally found a great All-You-Can-Eat Sushi place....thanks to researching reviews on the web. We took a client here who was staying at the Rio, so it was the only Sushi place nearby. A great find -  not a fancy place, but the food and service were fantastic! The place is small, but quiet enough so you could actually carry on a conversation. Not only AYCE sushi, but Bud light, too! (Sunday through Wednesday, according to signage). Staff was friendly, food was made to order, and was served in a timely manner.\nGoing back soon!
3 ||| Pleasant spot for a margarita-filled lunch or dinner. 3.5 stars\n\nHighlights:\n- Margaritas: I loved the fruity grand canyon one (lime, prickly pear, etc.) and the hub got an adult version of a milkshake canister with his 2-limit margarita (got 4 glasses out of that thing!)\n- Outside/inside seating: outside was nice on a patio especially at night overlooking some blue lit up trees and misters for the heat, but inside was a nice A/C haven for the height of the sunny day.\n- Chips: combo of sweet wontony, yellow corn, orange spiced, and blue corn as well as sweet potato chips. It's rare to find such variety.\n- Salsa: great roasted flavor\n- Pork: carnitas was a large portion of meat--quite juicy and tasty\n- Menu: pure mex and southwestern mex as well as pastas and salads\n- Dessert: creative presentation with white chocolate pecans enveloped in a tamale wrapper. Complementary item which was a nice touch.\n- Staff: super duper friendly which I appreciated\n\nLowlights:\n- Crabcake: too dense cornmealy for me--couldn't taste much flavor or crab\n- Fish: didn't taste too fresh and advertised that veggies would be in the mix, but only limited slivers to were found.\n\nDecent spot. I'd come again for chips and margaritas.
4 ||| Festivals. Fun. Beer. Lots of beer. Charlotte Center City Partners (or Find Your Center) puts on a lot of these types of festivals Uptown and in South End. When you check out their website or their weekly newsletter you'll be able to see lots of events coming up like Beer, Blues and BBQ, Taste of Charlotte, Speedstreet and the like. \n\nMany of these events and festivals usually have beer available, hence why I'm a fan. And, yeah, I also really like supporting the local organization that's responsible for Uptown's development. If only there was a PBR festival...!
3 ||| I was with my coworker on a business appt in this area today and he suggested we eat lunch here.  I was a little hesitant because the places he has mentioned in the past as being his usual haunts usually don't agree with me but I was actually surprised.  \n\nNow, the part of town is a bit sketchy and the interior is nothing fancy but the quality of food and the prices were right in line with what I wanted.  I decided to be safe and get the Taco Salad with Chicken Lunch Special (since I had a bad experience with Los Olivos only a few days ago).  They actually give you large strips of flavorful, tender chicken.  The chips were yummy and they offered 2 salsas. One was a bean style salsa that was mild and the other was a standard medium flavored.\n\nThe wait-staff was polite and quick on the refills (I am a big water drinker) so I appreciate the promptness.  \n\nI probably won't go out of my way to eat here but if in the neighborhood I will certainly stop by for a quick, tasty, and affordable lunch.
3 ||| Went here for lunch today..not bad. Like everyone else says its not super nice and a little slow. But the Chimichanga I had was good (nice and crispy but not dripping with grease) and it was cheap. We were able to go here for lunch and be back within an hour. I liked it and will be back!
1 ||| my last trip here was terrible. I had heard good things about this place, including the value for the food. The first time I went, I got a vegetarian plate and it was very good. However, the last time (and, I've been told, after management changed), I had a lamb sandwich and it had only 4-5 small pieces of lamb in it. definitely not worth the money for me.
3 ||| What to say about Peter's Pub... without potentially offending Lauren C:)\n\nI'd classify this as a dive bar in Oakland.  Whenever I'm at a bar in Oakland I worry I'll be thee oldest person there.  Thankfully, this doesn't happen at Peters.  Lost of different age brackets are hitting up this bar.  Is it for the free popcorn?  Who knows!\n\nAll I know are that the drinks are cheap and the DJ is admittedly pretty awesome!  I've never eaten here before, but I can bet they have bar food.  I know, far stretched, right?\n\nI've seen a lot of 21st birthday's stroll through here (of course) and you get to wear a fun viking hat.  I'd hit this up just for that...and potentially lie about my age just for a hat...
4 ||| The best food I've had in a loooooong time! TRY THE GARLIC SAUCE!!!!!! I've ate here everyday for a week once! Fried oysters dirty rice with creole sauce potato salad and extra garlic sauce!
3 ||| My first dim sum experience.\n\nAhhhhh.\n\nCan I just say I was intimidated by the massive amount of cars in the parking lot? Jiminy Christmas!\n\nLuckily, the wait wasn't too long before entering the dim sum paradise.\n\nThe staff was friendly. Not too good at describing what the food was like, but there's the adventuresome part for ya. \n\nSome standouts: the sesame pastries with the red bean paste and the coconut filling; the pork shui mai, the calamari, and the broccoli.\n\nMy most adventurous try? The jellyfish salad. Not gross, but not something I'm inclined to try again.\n\nYum yum!\n\nI will be back...
1 ||| Nice course, but I recommend they go private since their Ranger makes it well known he doesn't like the public playing here. We had a group of 8 guys in town for the holiday looking to enjoy a nice round. Nothing worse than having a ranger yell at you the second you hit the turn and decide to grab a hot dog and a few beers that you need to get on the tee box. No beverage cart on the course and an uptight ranger (properly named Dick) managed to ruin a perfectly good round. If you decide to play here with the mall cop attitude Rangers. I suggest you save your money and bring your own beverages and lunch. They treat the members like royalty and the public as second class citizens. We finished our round 15 minutes before the course average pace of play.  But nothing is worse than having an uptight ranger berating your group at every hole to pick up the pace. On a side note the ranger for the front 9 was friendly and accommodating. Spend your money elsewhere.
4 ||| My favorite location, and Lanis.. The store manager is so sweet! \n\nI used to work for Lanis at a different location and she runs her stores so well and everything is always so clean and fresh!\n\nEverything in this store is easy to find, and if you can't find it there is always someone willing to help. \n\nCheckout lines are fast and easy!! Baggers are quick and know what they are doing, parking lot is never filled with carts.
4 ||| Excellent, fast and friendly.  Clean restrooms and easy to navigate
4 ||| I bought a conference table and chairs a few months ago from AZ Office Liquidators, and feel like I got a great deal on great furniture.  This month, I purchased 10 refurbished office cubes from the company, and I couldn't be more satisfied.  \n\nLorraine designed our floor plan, sourced high-quality units in good condition, repainted shelves at no cost, and coordinated a no-hassles installation.   I'd make AZ Office Liquidatiors your first and last stop for office furniture.
1 ||| I buy my smokes at the little smoke shop next door, so if I need something small, I'll sometimes run in before heading home.  \n\nTheir selection is pathetic.  The few times I did shop there right after moving to the neighborhood, I'd have to make a second stop somewhere else, because this store does not carry easily half of the staples in my kitchen.  Their meat and produce sections are worse than AWFUL.  I wouldn't take most of their selections if they were free, and to make it worse, their prices on their crappy produce is in line with Whole Foods.  \n\nIf I'm grabbing sodas for a party, or a bag of ice, I'll accept their high prices for the convenience of it being around the corner from my house, or because I'm already in the parking lot, but I'll never do an actual grocery shopping trip here again.  \n\nDo yourself a favor.  Make the drive to Flamingo and Sandhill.  The Smiths there has a much better selection, better produce, better meat selection, better bakery, better prices, and friendlier staff.
4 ||| We rotate our coffee purchases between here and La Prima.  It's a tad overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for, but the staff is ready and willing to help direct you to a coffee bean that is perfect for your taste.  We've tried many different varieties of the dark blends, and all are delicious.  I highly recommend giving this place a try!
1 ||| What a bummer! \n\nSo I moved to Charlottes Historic Southend last week and knew right away that I had to try the ever-raved about Price's Chicken Coop. \n\nI had high expectations- since Ive heard nothing but great things about this place.  \n\nI went this Saturday for lunch and ran into a crowd (expected) but I heard the line went fast- and just figured it was a good sign! After about 15 minutes of fully-expected wait time I made my selection the 1/4 lb white chicken meal complete with a roll, hushpuppies, and coleslaw for only $6!\n\nI walked down to the Common Market to grab a drink and sit outside to eat my meal- (CM rocks by the way!) ...\n\nWhen I actually ate my chicken I was more than disappointed. While I am never one to completely disregard an eating establishment because its a so-called hole in the wall (as this is) I do expect it to be sanitary. I immediately encountered a large black curly hair (that was definitely not mine) ... I was so disgusted- I put that piece in the garbage and tried to regain some of my appetite  and at least give the other piece a try. The chicken was fairly dry and definitely nothing special. There wasn't a lot of meat at all - and Ive had better chicken at KFC  which isn't saying much. ...The Coleslaw had no carrots or anything and was ok in flavor- basically a sweet watery-mayonnaise shredded cabbage mixture...nothing great. The highlight of the meal were the hushpuppies- which were perfect in every way.\n\nI do feel like I will give this one more chance since everyone else claims it's so great...maybe I just had one outlying bad experience.
4 ||| If I had all of the sub chains lined up, I would pick Jersey Mike's. Why? Because none of the others have better tasting bread or higher quality meats. \n\nI only need one sandwich from here to be happy: the Italian on wheat, \"Mike's Way\". Boom. That's it. It was founded by an Italian, so obviously that sandwich is great. I have not had a better Italian than the one here (it must be dressed Mikes Way though!).\n\nI give this 5 stars with no hesitation.
0 ||| The rice was hard and the beans were cold. That was a terrible example for mexican food tonight. (12/26/2011)
2 ||| Calling this place a COOP is a misrepresentation.  What I know a COOP to be is a user owned business that requires a membership and volunteer work as part of the membership which is intended to provide products at  reasonable prices for all members due to the low operating costs. The prices of this place are on par with Whole Foods aka Whole Paycheck. You can pay to become a member but its not required to shop and generally membership doesnt confer any tangible benefit. Whole Food prices under the guise of a COOP? No thank you.\n\nAdmittedly, they have a reasonable selection of produce, bulk foods, meats, and alcohol.
4 ||| We have been bringing our two dogs and two cats to Arrow Animal Hospital for more than eight years.  We (including our dogs and cats) have always been treated wonderfully.  Because it appears that there is little turnover in staff, we feel as if the staff knows us very well, and in turn treats us almost like old friends.  We have also recommended Arrow Animal Hospital to friends who have let us know that they have had a very positive experience.
4 ||| For years this Jack in the Box has sustained me through college, when I was working and now that I am back in college. The staff is solid and food always consistent with Jack in the Box quality. (Yes you can read this anyway you want)\n\nWhen it comes to late night eats and you are to lazy/any other excuse you can think of not to walk into one of Las Vegas's many 24hr establishments, the Jack in the Box drive-thru is like a safe haven in the middle of a dark, vast wasteland of hunger
4 ||| I had NO idea there were THAT many varieties of cactus!\n\nThis is a great place to go during the day, when you are awaiting for your red eye flight back to the East Coast, you won't see anything like it east of I-95!\n\nTips:\n\n1. Try to go as early as you can, before the full desert sun comes out. \n\n2. Bring water, a hat or an umbrella (parasol)..it gets hot (see #1)\n \n3. Admission is $18, and an AAA discount is available.\n\n4. Bring a camera!
4 ||| AMAZING! does not even begin to describe this mall. I have been to hundreds of malls all over the country and this one definitely made it to my top 20. This mall is jaw dropping and has everything you look for in a mall and more. The amount of stores you have here is great and I have spent hours here. They also have stores Like Tory Burch, LIlly Pulitzer, Vineyard Vines, etc. so i do not have to go to department stores to get these brands. \n\nIf I moved here I know I would be here all the time. I think it is also just great because the town in general is very quiet and safe. I dont know what else to say about this mall besides that it is one of the best and has lots of amazing stores I would normally shop at in  my home town. Glad to see that there are more premium malls out there!
2 ||| Whatever you do DON'T stay in the courtyard rooms no matter how cheap they are. The walls are so thin you can hear everybody's conversations and you will definitely get woken up by constant loud noise. The room is also outdated. There's also no elevators for the courtyard rooms. Pay the upgrade to stay in the tower. It's so much nicer. The Oyster Bar is the best thing here, but be prepared to stand in line and wait. There's always a lot of people waiting unless you go in the middle of the night. There's only bar seating.
1 ||| I think its time to sacrifice time and convenience. When we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide, Robinson, and Ross Park. Even though it closer to my Dad's House when visiting...its time for us to part ways. The food and service is never as good at this location. I love, love, love their tofu tacos...but this was just eh this time...it was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just old...bleh. I couldn't even finish them, even though I cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year I get to have them. Total Bummer.
0 ||| Went here for a Christmas day meal and the menu and atmosphere looked promising. My wife ordered BBQ pork & rice, I had Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings. Waiter brought my wife's dish in about 5 minutes, but not mine. She didn't think it looked like BBQ pork -- I didn't know. She tasted it, said it wasn't and asked me to taste. I wasn't sure, but she called waiter over and asked if it was pork. He said no, that it was duck. My wife said she's ordered pork. Waiter disappears and a minute later appears with manager who tells my wife she can't return the dish b/c she's already eaten half of it (not even close). Manager says she can bring out BBQ pork, but cannot remake the dish. Waiter returns wife small separate plate of just BBQ pork & my wife has to separate the duck (which she doesn't like). Meanwhile, my food arrives about the same time. It was very tasty, but we'd planned on ordering something additional which we didn't do after the duck incident. Bill arrives, and they've charged an extra dollar for the pork replacement, plus added a $3 gratuity to the total. (Menu states gratuity for 6+ people; we were two adults + child.) We point this out to the waiter and he says, \"OK, OK, you don't have to pay that.\" Really, it doesn't matter how good the rest of the menu might be (and judging by my dish, some of it might be really good). What matters is the TERRIBLE customer service and handling of the incident. Will never ever return, especially with so many other options nearby.
4 ||| Quite possibly my favorite place in the entire United States. It's unfortunate it has to be in Pittsburgh, PA...but that's part of what makes it awesome in it's own way. I am giving this place the honor of my very first Yelp review even though I have not lived in Pittsburgh for more than a year.\n\nThis place has amazing American pub food. The nachos are piled high with an indeterminable amount of good toppings. The buffalo wings (and other kinds of wings) are large, properly covered in sauce, and perfectly spicy. But the best food here are the pizzas. The Flying Buffalo, the Garden of Eden, et. al. No matter what mood you are in, there's an awesome personal pizza to be had.\n\nAs if the food wasn't enough, they have probably the best (not the largest - the best) beer selection in Pittsburgh. House brews and Great Lakes (from Cleveland), Guinness, Yeungling, all on tap. More than 50 others in bottles. At decent prices too!\n\nAlmost all food is half-off after 11PM every night - which is key.\n\nOn Saturdays, the \"house blues man\" Don Sjzeck, plays his awesome mix of Johnny Cash, Greatful Dead, blues, and rock covers as well as his fun sing-along original stuff. It made every Saturday night awesome for me.\n\nHangover Breakfast on Sunday mornings is great for its stated purpose. Unlimited coffee, bloody marys, etc.\n\nDo what you need to do and go there one night. It's worth it and its an awesome Pittsburgh experience.
2 ||| Don't eat the fish tacos, my wife was up all night with intestinal distress. We told the waitress they tasted fishey. She assured us it was the highest quality Mahi Mahi. Rice and beans are average. I had the carnie asaida, it was good. It was a piece of beef 9\"by 6\" and 1/4\" thick, rice and beans. Nothing special.
3 ||| surly bartenders and foamy guinness.\n\nwhat's not to like?
1 ||| What you see is not always what you get. The delivered item was a deep chocolate brown instead of the light brown in the showroom. Someone should have advised me before delivery as color was one of the main deciding factors in the purchase.  Also there were irregularities like the pillow back is short and overstuffed instead of the skinny height of the floor model and even the arms are lower. It's a disappointment.....
2 ||| i  am 1.7 miles away from store and out of their range for delivery 1.7 miles well now i will never order or eat from their again
2 ||| We had a pleasant experience, however, the price does not match the product.  We also found the atmosphere to be somewhat confusing.  The outside speaks of a cute, provincial, country-inspired cottage.  The inside, however, is a combination of French/Louisiana inspired food and decor.  Our server was very friendly, but overall, it seemed like it was missing the mark.
4 ||| I have only ordered take-out from here a couple times, but thoroughly enjoyed everything I have ordered.  The wait staff is very nice... one of the times I was there waiting for my food a very impatient and rude patron was being very mean to the hostess and she took it in stride with a smile on her face.  When someone can do that I give them props:)
0 ||| I've been to this place multiple times and have had satisfactory service and descent food during lunch.  Today was off the charts bad. Horrible service, cold and tasteless food, and lastly no apology for either. \n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived at 11:50am for lunch, were seated promptly and had our drink and food order taken shortly there after. After our drinks were dropped off we then didn't have contact with the waitress(the owners daughter) for 35 minutes. When she did check on us it was to figure out what our food order was. Ten minutes later or food was dropped off, but it wasn't the food we ordered.  Since this was a workday lunch we accepted out food and asked to see if we could have our bill discounted. The waitress said she \"didn't think they did that\".   When we asked to see a manager, she responded she was the manager. \n\nI highly recommend that no one gives this place any business. There are plenty of places downtown to grab lunch where they treat their customers with respect and common courtesy.
3 ||| Excellent experience.  The owner was there and got to talk with him for a while.  I could tell he really cared about me having a great experience.  Found their oil change coupon and thought I'd take advantage of it.  They showed me the air filter and how dirty it was.  I replaced it.  The said the rest of my car is in great shape.  I will be back.
4 ||| Very good southern fried chicken and waffles.  Wait staff was amazing and the sweet tea is out of this world good. The waffles remind me of Waffle House waffles, and that's a good thing!  \n\nI had the chicken tenders and you could tell they were breaded in the kitchen and no pre-frozen. My wife had the chicken and waffles and she really enjoyed it!  \n\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place!
1 ||| Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. \n\nThe space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?
4 ||| Niec place to get a pint or watch a game... there food is suprisingly good... they have some sort of brisket sliders that are freaking awesome... if you are in uptown and need a place to watch sports with good food this is it...
4 ||| There are 2 reasons I love this place:\n\n1. Weekend brunch.\n2. Great joint for kicking back with some friends and ordering tasty pitchers of beer. \n\nFor brunch I LOVE love love their crab cake & asparagus eggs benedict. Although last time I had it the asparagus was overcooked and they slopped too much hollandaise on everything. The crab cakes, however, are always DEEEELISH! Also can't beat the drink deal they have with the breakfast items - only $1 for a full sized bloody mary?? Yes please!
2 ||| so, yeah. stopped by for lunch today, had the teriyaki chicken salad. not quite sure how this was a salad - 5 strips of teriyaki chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce? ok, i'll concede that generally chinese food restaurants don't do salads well, but still. that was pathetic. chicken was fatty. sauce was flavorful. oh and my table had a funky plant/fake flower vase ... the green leaves were alive and in water, the fake flowers were mixed in with the live plant. weird.
4 ||| I came here for lunch, and since the last time I've came here they changed the menu. For the first time I saw a burger called the 21 express. Three Patties?! ...Umm, I definitely will get that next time. But at first glance I was a little intimidated by the burger. I however decided to get the Double Cheeseburger. And whoa, explosion in my mouth (or a slight clog in my arteries) I felt it. But that's all good, the lettuce and tomato was there to kind of open those arteries.\n\nOverall, this place is always busy during lunch time. And I could see why. Cheap prices, homey feel, and the long lineage and history of South 21 gives you the bang for your buck for a fast and tasty meal.
1 ||| I had not eaten at Anna's in a number of years because of the decline in the quality of food and service. After reading that the resort had changed ownership we decided to give give the restaurant a second chance. BIG MISTAKE. While the menu was more limited, the selections sounded appealing so I ordered the beef short ribs for $24. What I got was ONE short rib which was mostly bone and fat served over a small mound of mashed potatoes with two thin carrots covered with gravy. I won't be returning to Anna's any time soon.  There are plenty of other restaurants in that area with better food at much more reasonable prices.
1 ||| The food was delicious, but the service was not that great. No one checked on us once between the time we received our food to the time we were ready for the check.
3 ||| I stopped by the Tip Top yesterday evening with some coworkers to finally check it out. I've been curious since renovations began and was expecting great things. After a late shift, we were there for drinks and light food. The place was bustling, and yes noisy, yet we could still have a conversation without straining at a table near the back wall - so don't be afraid to bring a friend here if you actually want to chat. Selection was great and everything that we ordered (and actually received) was excellent. The fried pickles are crispy, delicious, and done right.\n\nHowever after waiting a half hour for an order of chicken wings, we were able to grab our server's attention and ask about my wings. \"Oops,\" she said. And then a not very satisfying apology. Having already waited a half hour, we were wrapping our night up and I said, \"Let's forget them\" since she was offering any solutions. \n\nSomewhere between ordering the wings and realizing we wouldn't get them, our server told us she was taking off for the night and asked us to settle up with her. Our bill was completely off. You could say the free beers offset the lost order but it definitely wasn't intentional since the bill came first.\n\nI have high expectations of customer service and Tip Top Tavern failed, which is too bad because I was really beginning to like the place.
4 ||| We've visit this location pretty frequently since we are at this plaza frequently as well. They have a great selection of books, magazines, and of course a Starbucks cafe if you are interested in a drink while you browse / read.  \n\nThe staff here is always friendly and helpful. They regularly check to see if you need anything if you pass by them or look a little lost. We love to spend time here since it is quiet and it's nice to be surrounded by actual books!\n\nOverall: A\nNo complaints!
2 ||| Took my truck to get brake fluid flush and rear brakes adjusted. Drove my truck 4 miles and the rear brakes locked up and started smoking. Took the truck back and they said the mechanic over adjusted the rear brakes.
0 ||| Overpriced and poor quality. Their nem nuong cuon was pathetic. The meat was stale, and falls apart when you bite into it. It was about $6 and some change for an order of 2 rolls. I got the pho ga. It was ok. They gave me a lot of chicken meat though. My girlfriend's broth tasted like there was still soap in it. Guess they're pretty clean.
3 ||| Ok, today it was my\" Sunday treat day\" because my boyfriend works every other Sunday so whenever he is off he spoils me taking me wherever I would like to go, so today I really wanted to try the Lao Lang restaurant but it was closed so we ended up at bahn Thai by accident, from outside it looked very simple but once you enter it is a nice place with real plants everywhere which gives you a homey feeling, Thai ornaments and pictures. \n\nThe menu it's a little bit overwhelming, it's like if your eyes get tense without even trying, I had no idea of what to get so I chose a familiar route, a green curry with chicken and squash, zucchini and Thai eggplant, oh yeah, the whole family came to the pool hahaha. Everything was nice and tender. The consistency was thinner than any other green curries I have tried and the level of spiciness was right. My boyfriend had a red curry with duck and he said it was ok. The service was friendly and attentive.
2 ||| Definitely not the best place in town to see a show, but I have so many fond memories of this place that I can't rightly give it a bad review.  Not the best setup and the drink tend to cost more than seems rational, but it is definitely an intimate venue that usually books a pretty good variety of music.  It seems, though, that they've gone a bit downhill as far as the booking of national acts goes. Actually, they don't seem too big on local acts either. I wonder what happened. Probably just another target of the overzealous ALRC.
1 ||| Being the mom of triplets I have spent a lot of time in this store and a lot of money.  Just spent another $250 buying stuff today.  They had a sale and I got some good deals on clothes and bedding for the children.  The store is pretty good if you can catch a sale otherwise it is just too expensive.  \n\nThe employees run hot and cold there.  Sometimes I can get lots of help and other times I am on my own.  The good news is that when I have had to track people down to help me they have been helpful and polite.  \n\nOne of the biggest things I have about businesses is the bathroom.  A clean bathroom in a place to me is a good sign that it is well run and clean.  If that is the case then the bathroom is lying about the store.  The store seems clean and well run but the bathroom was a wreck!  There is dirt on the doors, stuff smeared on the walls of the stall and the floor looked disgusting!  I would NOT take my children in there unless it was a DIRE EMERGENCY!\n\nSo to re-cap.  The store is pretty nice and the staff is typically friendly but avoid the bathroom like the plague!
3 ||| Everything's fine here... they do seem to run out of chicken at times so like dark meat they were out of on a few occasions. otherwise I go back often, drive-through is fast and accurate.
4 ||| Best best Thai I've found in charlotte. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. And the food very flavor filled. Order #32 with a fried egg added and you cannot go wrong.
0 ||| This is quite possibly the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life. I came here with my mom and as soon as I sat down I noticed that I had a dirty plate in front of me, ewwww! so I pushed it aside and asked for a new one.no biggy for now.I looked at the menu and noticed it wasnt that big at all and everything was around $14-$18 a dish so it better be good right! Well I ordered the veal piccata.....big mistake! it came with 3 flattened medallions of veal and spaghetti with an olive oil and garlic sauce, The veal was horrible it had no taste to it and what taste it did have wasnt good.It was way overcooked to the point that I could hardly even cut it. usually you would serve angel hair pasta with piccata but whatever it just didnt work at all the whole dish just looked sloppy and was swimming in sauce that should have been rendered much much further.the bread they served on the side was horrible and tasteless much like the rest of the meal, and the whole olive oil and parm thing was just nasty I mean come on people we know its the stuff out of the can! had to ask for balsamic for the bread to give it some flavor which the balsamic should be on the table in the first place.the waiter added drinks to our bill that we didnt get and I dont know if they do this all the time but he put down an automatic 18 percent tip for himself.......usually thats for parties over 6 right? I dont get that one but I dont think its right.and for the people that have given good reviews on this place dont trust them, im sure they are either employees or family because this place is disgusting!
0 ||| I have taken my Shitzu Joey there for a long time to get a shampoo and cute, and have not been happy. I was too lazy to go anywhere else. Well now, I'm done with Petco. Their quality is terrible. Pricing is HIGH, and they turnover employees in the grooming all the time. I will spend some time here on Yelp to find a quality, reaonably priced groomer. Goodbye Petco for good!
3 ||| pretty girls but no lollipop selection.
4 ||| After touring Death Valley, we decided to go to Cathay house as we were looking for some authentic Chinese food.  We were seated immediately after we entered, and the food came out quickly.  \n\nThe lobster noodles were good, they get them fresh from the fish tank next to the wall.  Poor lobsters!  But oh so delish.  We also got the pork with the fried skin that people were raving about, and it was goood.  The skin was crispy and the meat very tender.  \n\nOverall I was stuffed and it was well worth the money!  Excellent service, ambiance/decor, good food, at a decent price.  Thumbs up!
4 ||| If you love authentic street tacos, this place is a must try!  Their enchiladas are also awesome and the carne asada is fantastic too.  If you're going for lunch during the week, I would recommend calling in your order.  They are usually very busy during that time.
4 ||| The regional manager for Sammy's Woodfire Pizza contacted me based upon the unpleasant experience I had. I can proudly say she went out of her way to correct the problems that occurred and make it up to me. I was really impressed at the dedication to improving the customer experience. It is rare to see that these days, thank you!!
4 ||| I live right down the street from this place so it's convenient. I moved to LV just over a year ago. I am soooooo disappointed by what people in Las Vegas call pizza. I eat a lot of pizza. I'm not gonna say I know what good pizza is because I say I'm from New York or Chicago. I know what good pizza is because of the experience I have with pizza over the course of my life. People that say they know what good pizza is simply because they are from a certain town need to be beaten senseless. There are two great pizza places in Las Vegas. One is across town. Red Rock is the other. U can tell that they take the time to actually mix their recipes with quality ingredients. Their sauce is flavorful and u can tell that it's not some 6in1 rubber-tasting crap out of a can that 95% of the shops here use. When I was there, the old man was making meatballs from scratch. Their vast array of gourmet/specialty pizzas are unique. They don't have the same old pizzas that other shops use. All in all, if you want a good pie, Red Rock Pizza is the best pizza in NW Vegas.
3 ||| I have been here on numerous occasions with a variety of people and the one thing I must say about this place is inconsistency.  You can go there one night and have great food and service, whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite.  The same goes for the food.  Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits, stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza).  If you are a beer lover, they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site.  The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food.  The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself.  If you give this place a shot, prepare to roll the dice because you don't know who you will get, or what the food will be like when it comes out.  The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made on-site.  Can't beat that sometimes...
0 ||| SHIT HOLE!!!  Too bad 0 stars is not an option here.  The staff and management are rude and only want money.  Someone sprayed pepper spray and sent multiple patrons to the ER and the staff just sat there like they could care less.  Save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet!.  This place is so ghetto and trashy.  All the money they make from $30 admissions and it still looks the same as it did in 1974.  Disgrace to the gay community!!
0 ||| I was there for a conference and I am a local. I didn't stay in the hotel but I was there for over 8 hours so I used the conference room and ate lunch there. The food selection was OK, but it is similar to other casino's. I ate at Metro Pizza. The reason for the low rating has to do with the conference room. The group didn't purchase a group wireless internet package so in order for us to get wifi, we had to purchase it on our own. Not usually a bad thing until I was told by their sales office that it is $24.95 for one hour and $80 for the day. Are you serious? My monthly high speed internet is only  $50 for the month. I was attending a conference and usually it is included or a nominal fee to get it, but $25 for one hour is ridiculous.  Stay away from them if you need wifi while on the premises. They do offer a basic wifi with the room but charge an additional $8 to get decent speeds. Caution if you need good wifi speeds.
4 ||| Dexter just graduated from puppy school today.  We've been going for 8 weeks and Lauren, the trainer, was awesome!  Even when Dexter piddled, she didn't get pissed.  Of course, he was the most adorable puppy in class...Ok, most of the time he was the ONLY one in class, but, still...\nThe first few weeks, we were given bags of treats to take home and use for homework.  Yes, homework.  After each class, I was given a hand-out of that week's class to use at home.\nThe class cost $109 for 8 weeks and was sooooo worth it!  Not only do I have THE most adorable puppy in the entire universe, but he's also the smartest.  He's a store favorite.  All the employees learned his name!  Of course, he's a lot like Mommy and went up to anyone looking for some lovin'.  Er...*I* don't do that, but you know what I mean.\nI've heard about other PetSmart's training classes.  This one didn't live up to the horror stories!\nHe'll be going for intermediate classes in the fall.  I guess that's like Middle School.  For dogs.
1 ||| Stood around looking at laptops for 20 minutes, not one salesperson offered to help me. And I had $1500 to spend. Since no one offered to help, I left the store with my money, and opted to buy online, straight from Apple. FU Best Buy. Learn how to walk over and say \"May I help you?\" One guy was wandering around, blowing pink gum bubbles out of his mouth; he walked by me 3 times! But never once offered to help me.
1 ||| I've been to My Wine Cellar previously & wasn't very impressed with the experience. Since our friends wanted to try it out, we decided to go back. It was not at all busy when we went & were told we could sit at any table. We really wanted to sit outside but were warned that there's a golf course behind the restaurant, thus there is a mosquito problem.\n\nWe grabbed a table & our waiter came to greet us & take our drink order right away. I thought it was disgusting that he acknowledged that there was a mosquito squashed on the page of the menu but gave it to me anyway. I think that it wouldn't have taken much effort to go grab another menu. It was his first day I guess.\n\nWe got the Oatmeal Stout beer & the pink Moscato for drinks and the bistro burger & the salmon cakes for our meal. Both of the food dishes were good. The bistro burger was large & filling and the side of fries was also tasty. I think for the price we paid for the salmon cakes, it would've been nice to get an actual side instead of just the spring greens.\n\nThe service was fine. I've been to wine bars before & enjoyed them more so I doubt we will be back.
1 ||| The staff did not like that we brought a baby, even though we came to do the baby footprints and handprints pottery. One crew member seemed genuinely annoyed by the baby and wouldn't help us prepare the work. Another crew member had to join us. I doubt we will go back.
3 ||| Romancing the Bean: Too cute . . . Name and the place alike!  If I worked in this area, I'd be in BIG trouble. \n\nDine in service or To-go available here; obviously this is about a To-go experience. \n\nWas in an all-day class in the Microsoft Office suite, and came down here on one of the breaks for some coffee. \n\nEnded up walking out with their Daily Roast aka one strong cup o' Joe, plus one of the most amazing blueberry scones I've ever tasted! \n\nJust the right amount of sweet, browned perfectly on the outside but still a soft on the inside. Nothing like those Crisco Bomb \"scones\" plaguing Starbucks pastry cases nationwide. \n\nDid I mention this was all for $3.88? \n\nTaylor was the cashier and she provided friendly and speedy service during the morning rush. \n\nIf you work over here, it'd be a mistake to not check out Romancing the Bean for some coffee, breakfast or lunch. \n\nKnow I'll be back when visiting clients in this part of Tempe!
1 ||| The place has tasty, fresh and natural food. But the 3 stars goes because service is a big chaos!. The self service doesn't work with the place stuffed with shelf after shelf of products. They have ppl \"working\" there, but no one seems to do much, and when ever you are waiting for your order, the question \"what are you waiting?\" won't make your order faster. Parking? the free valet parking is just an illusion. Other than that...the best is the gelato place next to them.
3 ||| For the price it was good....I was a little leery at first because on the outside my door had no key hole, it looked like it had been removed! Then on the inside the latch to lock it was VERY loose like someone had tried to bust in before! Definitely agreeing with the crackhead comment, I saw some staring at me through their window while I was swimming ...eww.. creepy! \n\nThe one thing I do need to say is the staff was very friendly for the most part ;) Very handsome blonde guy from TN, working up front the majority of the time I was there ;) HE was VERY helpful, AND knowledgeable on things to do in the area!! GO TO GUY! He should be working for a better place than this one! \n\n\nBut ....that tick story?? \n\nOMG I am a little freaked out to come back again, but if you do see me coming through Phoenix again (shudders) I will MAYBE re-consider staying at this place for the decent rooms, HUGE ASS bed, FREE breakfast, and nice little swimming pool to cool off in.\n\nThanks again, *SO sorry I forgot your name* Cute guy! LOL\n\nBUT, P.S. TELL the owner he should have free ice, thats inflation if I have ever seen it! :) See YA!
4 ||| Starbucks carries a great reputation. LOVE STARBUCKS!
0 ||| Went here this past weekend and it was NOT a good experience.  The food was ok but the service was horrible as soon as we walked in the door.  Definitely won't be going back.
3 ||| Wanted a Pedicure and figured I'd give this place a try since it was across the street from my hotel.
0 ||| I had posted a review while in the restaurant, but realized that the few words I prattled off did not do justice to the experience.  All these other positive reviews this place has, I do not understand.  So here is the real review this place deserves:\n\nFirst off, the entrance to the place.  I get that this franchise is trying to sell the idea of fresh/healthy food.  Salad is suppose to be healthy.  However, walking in the first thing you notice is the dead and dying hanging herb garden.  This assortment of plants look as though they had not seen anyone's attention in months.  Given the storms in the valley, I would have given this a pass, but once inside the door, you are greeted with baskets full of rotting red peppers and Leaks that have been ignored for so long they had mold growing in the stems.  (Not exactly what you call fresh)  You can tell it was nothing more than a thoughtless display that was tossed together months ago and forgotten.\n\nNext the price.  26$ for two people to eat lunch...  Really... for a buffet?   I understand that healthy food is more expensive.  (Pita Jungle regularly gets my dollars) The price would not be that far out of line if the food quality was there to support the price.  Or if it was fresh, made-to-order like PJ.  (This was not)\n\nSo the food.  Bland, no seasoning, pre-packaged tasting and gross.  As I got my plate and stepped into the line I was met with wet, wilted over dressed greens.  They were soaking in a bowl of water and dressing.  Not a good start.  I picked a few of the other items as a sample, expecting to find something worth coming back for.  Alas, I never came back to this line for many reasons, but mostly because nothing had any flavor.  If was mostly texture and the idea of salad.   \n\nI continued on to the soup.  Several selections, but again, you could tell nothing was fresh and everything came out of a commercial plastic bag.  No flavor, and not a speck of salt or seasoning.  Bland and flavorless.  \n\nI then tried the mac n cheese and other pasta choices, hoping for something to save the meal.  No luck...  No seasoning, bland and gross.  The mac and cheese would have been better if it came out of a box.  The oil rising to the top of the cheese sauce you could wick off with your napkin.\n\nLast chance to save the meal, I hit the potato bar.  (I mean, how do you screw up a potato?)  They found a way!  The potato was so over-cooked that it had the texture of chalk... Hot, flavorless, chalk.  Even with all the toppings, I could not get past the texture.  Then came the extra-special bonus.  A piece of plastic.  (Looked like the tip of a bag  clip)  Hey... It happens, so not a big deal, but...  Where did it come from?  The potato was whole, so it had to have been in with the toppings right?  (The mystery of the rouge plastic bag clip bugged me the whole drive home.)\n\nAll in all...  This place is off my list for good.  Even if they cleaned up their act, I'm not sure that I would give it a try again.  For the price I can do sushi, Pita Jungle or just about any other healthy alternative for the same price or less.  No, this is not a place I would ever recommend or return to again.\nMRM
1 ||| I guess when you grow up eating authentic Indian food, the bar gets set pretty high.  Maharani was not at all what I'd hoped for.  The food was bland, under-seasoned and the woman working the door seemed not to care much that we bothered walking in.  \n\nThe decor is old and drab, the entire place having a rather sad mood.  Someone needs to wake up, update, and start cooking with passion.\n\nLife is too short.  Go elsewhere until that happens.
4 ||| It's a great place. They make you feel gpod.
2 ||| I went to this Staples because it is close to home. I first went to buy paper. Was astounded at the price for a ream of all purpose paper. To get the advertised ream for $2.99, one had to get a rewards card that works (mine has never) and then apply on line for a rebate! Hell no, who has time for this shit? When one can get it for $2.99 or less at just about any other store one shops? \nI also wanted Resume paper, the selection was very limited and a believe a bit overpriced and can also be picked up at a Walmart, Target, or Office Depot (my preferred office supply store) for a fairer price. I left without paper. Oh and the customer service was non-exsistence, other than pointing me in the direction of what I might be looking for as they stood around gossiping among themselves.\n\nHowever, I returned the next afternoon with my computer for the free PC Tune Up. An E-Tech was called up to assist me at the check in desk for computers. It was slightly after 3pm, and he was going to check my computer in until I asked the turn around time and was told I would not get it back today because it was late! Mind you the place was open until 7 or 8 pm.  I opt out and asked if they scheduled appointments. Now informed that they did I made an appointment for the next day at 11am. \n\nThe next day I arrive and check in my computer. I inform them I am having trouble suddenly connecting to the Internet as well as an ongoing annoying problem of computer maintenance messages popping up, and a virus program I bought from Staples not working anymore and not expired. \n\nThe General Manager Shalamar, was there and assured me they would call when it was ready. I leave. Almost 4 hours later I get a call. I return and am given my computer and told there were no viruses found and that nothing was done so still ongoing have the on going issues and it has not been repaired, but I only find this out after asking! \n\nCouldn't someone have called me in those 4 hours and told me this? Maybe I would have given an OK to further investigate to repair the system! I was about to walk out when the GM said wait, there is paperwork they should be giving you and they are to go over it with you. I wait. The two techs bicker over why it isn't printed out. One sends it to the printer and walks away. I wait. I wait until the GM has the guy paged to return! He takes it off the printer and proceeds to go over the information based on my PC check up/ Tune Up. Apparent to the GM this guy is doing a half ass job of it, the GM listening in makes him stop and go over a section or two in a more professional manner. \n\nIn the end nothing is resolved and I am presented with two options they can take to get my computer operating for $60 and an overnight stay of my computer. One which would delete all data I have stored and restore it to starting status. I opt to take it and make other arrangements and return to them as a last resort- which I openly tell them. \n\nI get my PC home and I play around with it for about 30 or 40 minutes. Mind you I have little knowledge of computer issues. I find a \"restore recently deleted files from Trash \" selection and click it. Presto my computer is restored in 90 seconds! \n\nBut that apparently this was to detailed a fix for them to do at a Tune Up that took half the work day! \n\nBut kudos to the GM, if he wasn't' babysitting them the entire day I don't think any of them would have done a thing the entire day! He even had to tell them to clean up the front counter and register area as I waited and waited for that computer report which turned out to be vital paperwork in helping me fix my own system problem. Glad I waited! Need I say, I have no intent on returning for anything here.
1 ||| Ordered a pizza and their pizza fries for pick up tonight. Ordered pizza at 7:12pm. Email says it takes about 20 mins. Get there about 7:40ish. The girl says we're just waiting on the fries. Oook. Fast forward 20 mins after seeing people come and go. I ask where our order is at. She says matter of factly: \"I gave your order of fries to the wrong order and he's remaking them now.\" Not an apology nor did they think to tell me this. Now I'm irritated. Fast forward ANOTHER 15 MINUTES...HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE FRIES?? The manager (believe or not) calls my name finally. I asked why did this take so long, it has been well over an hour after I ordered.  Mumbled something about the fries, again no apology. I asked him has our pizza been sitting there this whole time then, getting cold?? He said \"well it should still be FAIRLY warm but I can make another one for you\" -_-. After waiting so long I didnt want to wait another hour for warm pizza...and so that my fries would get cold anyway. On top of all that I paid for ranch...of course they didn't give it to us and I had to ask for them. Got home, pizza was stone cold. Never again Sardellas!!
4 ||| CREAMY AND DELICIOUS!  And I am not talking about food people....its about cream....\n\nI like this BNBW since it is across the street from the mall and usually a lot less busy. The staff is alway really friendly and they have all the same deals. Last time I shopped there they even helped me by giving me some coupons and working out how I would get the most out of my purchase that day. HOW NICE IS THAT?\n\nBut, my drug of choice right now is this bed spray they have there. It is a must have. I want to make my own Oprah's favorite things list - but Tanya's favorite things list just to put it on. I spray it on everything...my bed, the couch, my cat, my boyfriend...EVERYTHING. It smells so good and is so relaxing.  I wait for coupons just so that I can go and get some more. It is a hidden treasure!\n\nIt....is...called.....Aromatherapy Sleep Pillow Mist ( Lavendar Chamomile) and it is $10. The most pleasure you can get for $10 in Las Vegas....thats what I am saying!\n\nOverall - LOVE it, but mostly for my hit of bed spray.
1 ||| I got punished and paid the price for trying a burrito at a place best known for their tacos. It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. \"I know, that is why we have Yelp!\"\n\nThis place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 \"so called\" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food. \n\nFirst of all, I love all my \"super burritos\" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.\n\nI'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, \"I got ripped off.\" The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.  \n\nI ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.\n\nTo find a decent \"super\" burrito in another city continues.
2 ||| So, had to bring Mom in for Labs, found the new office, thanks to the professional signage. Also,  found out that they merged \"bought\" Dr. Melli's practice...Much of the staff is still here. We will give Dr. Goldman a try. As I sit in their gigantic waiting room, an indication the wait times aren't going down any time soon, I am noticing that the Drug Reps are already pestering the Drs and bringing lunch...it's a good thing THEY were notified of the move!!!\nI guess notifying the patients, far down on the to do list. They did have to make signs after all.
4 ||| Yum, I'm glad that I've finally gotten to experience Barb's. Bobby declined for a month every time i offered since it's easier to just grab breakfast in Oakland or downtown. \n\nI've become a little non-existent on yelp lately due to my urge to learn to cook (& cook well!) I've been making dinner at home and packing my lunch daily, so breakfast at Barbs last Saturday (which was also our 2-year special date) was our first time eating out in a good month. \n\nI ordered the traditional breakfast; 3 eggs, home fries, choice of meat & toast. Bobby ordered the kitchen sink after I informed him that many people on yelp recommended that option. He was satisfied and I think its pretty awesome you get to choose the 3 meats in your kitchen sink omelet. \n\nSpeaking of that, when I asked if they had sausage patties i was surprised to hear yes but even more happy that they had 3 different options in the sausage patty category (score!) \n\nThere were a few mishaps but we never mentioned them to server because the food was still delicious. (minor mishaps.. wrong sausage, no onions/peppers on home fries after requested & never given an option on toast. we were just brought out Italian) None of these were too big of a deal, but I thought there should be a reason behind my rating... Im sure any of the workers would have bent over backwards to fix the issue if we had brought it up. Everyone was friendly! \n\nWe'll be back and I'm sure next time it'll be even better. I have to mention the coffee is great and the cup is bottomless.
1 ||| Horrible experience.  None of the nurses could draw blood on my baby.  I had to hold him down while. ..not kidding. ..4 different nurses tried through out the day.  His doctor in the past had no trouble getting blood and no he wasn't dehydrated or anything.  When i finally saw the doctor it was for literally 5 minutes and i felt like she had no time for me and was very unfriendly and uncaring as were some of the nurses I encountered. I gave it two stars instead of one only because there was ONE male nurse there who made all the difference toward the end of our visit. I wish i new his name . I hope we never need to go to the hospital again but if so i will only go to mercy Gilbert ( see review, they are excellent) . ..... and maybe I would try phoenix children's hospital but hopefully that won't be needed though
2 ||| I only went to Zorba's a couple times before it closed, and I remember being disappointed with it because I could get much better gyros back home.  I had given up on gyros on campus (until I went to niro's but that's another review) but I was willing to give Zorba's another chance when it reopened.  Many of my friends thought I was crazy for preferring niro's, so maybe I just remembered wrong?\n\nWell, it was pretty much the same as I remembered.  The meat is mediocre, and I feel like you definitely get more for your money at niro's.  I do like that they have different sizes so you don't have to get a giant gyro if you're not particularly hungry.\n\nHad I rated Zorba's before coming back, I would have given them four stars.  The food isn't bad; I've just had better.  But my favorite part of a gyro is the cucumber sauce, and it just wasn't right here.  Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't it supposed to be thick, white, and yogurty?  And nice and cold so you get that contrast between the cold sauce and the warm gyro meat?  Well, the sauce here was runny, warm, and almost clear.  I don't know, maybe something was just weird when I went, but with Niro's in my backyard (where I know they have the right sauce) and graduation in a month, I doubt I'll be back.
3 ||| We have always had pleasant experience at Sport Chalet, but this last visit was exceptional.  The fianc\u00e9 was looking for shoes that can be run in rugged terrain, and the staff was super duper helpful.   He went the extra mile to show us the shoes he recommend (New Balance V1212, or something like that), and even went to the back to show us the picture.  He was definitely knowledgeable.  Although we didn't make a purchase, he was friendly and helpful.\n\nThey usually have a few racks on clearance.  Though the discount isn't that great.  However, Sport Chalet is close by so we will always be returning customers.
4 ||| As soon as we pulled up someone came out to help us with our boxes! Great and friendly service!
4 ||| Outstanding.
4 ||| I dined-in here quite a few times as a child (and liked it) but now and days, my family hits this place up for take out. I really like the food here and I like the portions. It's a good place to go when you want leftovers to eat for later. I have never gotten take out here and eaten the entire thing in one sitting. Good place to get some lunch, and then just eat the rest for dinner. I am a big fan.
4 ||| I love this place for my nails and pedicure! I am so particular, PICKY and meticulous with everything from brows, skin and haircut and Tina does everything to perfection like the way I like it! I have never had to look at my French and say anything bad about them! She is perfect with polish, the smile line and making sure there is no cuticle or skin left! And Ricky is also da bomb at pedicures! If you want someone to get all the crust and cuticle, he is the one to go to!!
4 ||| I really like their chocolate chip scone.  It tastes great and really is quite large.\n\nAlso, it's nice that they have a selection of newspapers to read while you are there.
1 ||| I eat at Fiesta Cafe once every four or five years. Every time I've ordered a different item from the cheesy, MS Wordpad printout menu that never seems to change.  It's kind of remarkable how consistently awful the food has been over the last 10 years. I don't think I've ever eaten a decent meal there. Any of the typically applicable laws of physics and would dictate that by now all the typewriter monkeys that edit the menus should have somehow shitted out something less edible than the tacos here. Go to Taco Bell and eat it on the Fiesta Cafe Patio . Then you won't have to fight yourself to leave a tip.
1 ||| every time i order from them it takes more than 30 min and i live less than a mile away. my order is always right minus one time that was wrong
4 ||| Great local coffee shop! I love that it's right off the bike path - gives it a nice, neighborhood feel. Beautiful back patio and large glass doors for when the weather isn't ideal but you still want a view of the outdoors. The food and pastry options are minimal but the coffee is good and I usually only go there for a place to hang out and study. Theres a decent amount of seating but I have had trouble finding anywhere to sit several times already. I also love that they have a few games available as well, though I wouldn't complain if they added a few more options ;)
4 ||| We really enjoy Krua Thai.  Its a small place and never super crowded.  The food has been reliably delicious.  My husband prefers Krua Thai to Sala Thai, but I'd maybe say it's a tie with overall experience being better at Krua and food maybe slightly better at Sala.
2 ||| This branch is so slow, especially around 10 am to 2 pm.  Always seems to have 10 employees but only 3 windows open.  Random employees walking around saying \"thanks for coming in today\" \"how's your day going\". My day was going well until I came in.  I recommend using the atm for every possible thing that  the atm dose, instead of going inside.
3 ||| I love the ambiance of this place. It's so totally awesomely old-school Vegas. Dark, red booths, tuxedo waiters, etc. And it's where Elvis Presley, the Rat Pack, etc. dined. There are even plaques next to the booths they regularly sat at. (Yeah, I totally went and sat in the Elvis booth.) 5 stars.\n\nWhen you walk in, there's a bar area with gaming on the bar and some couches and whatnot. \n\nWe were greeted and seated promptly. The place was virtually empty on a weeknight.\n\nOur waiter was friendly, but the service just wasn't what one would expect of an old-school establishment, nor was it on par with the service at other Strip establishments. I love the old-school places where they fold your napkin for you if you get up and use the restroom, where the courses are properly timed, where the food is held and not brought to the table of everyone isn't there (because someone went to the restroom), etc. But alas, this place did not offer that sort of classy service. 2 stars.\n\nWe started with the Caesar salad and French onion soup. The salad is made table side and was $12 a person. It was crazy delicious. Easily one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. 5 stars. The French onion soup was also yummy. Bubbly and full of cheese. 4 stars.\n\nBefore I was even done eating the salad (and whilst I was in the restroom), the steak was delivered. We opted to share the 22oz ribeye. At $50-some bucks, it's a big steak for a relatively low price (by comparison). But it wasn't all the great. It certainly wasn't bad and was cooked exactly as we ordered it. But it just didn't have a lot of flavor to it. 3 stars. Shoulda ordered the filet...\n\nTo go with the steak, we ordered the bernaise and peppercorn sauces. Both were rather ho-hum. 3 stars.\n\nWe also ordered the twice baked potato at the waiter's suggestion. It was overdone and not particularly flavorful. 2 stars.\n\nWith the Groupon, the price we paid wasn't too bad. But I gotta say, had we paid full price, I wouldn't have thought it worth it.\n\nThe main attraction here is the ambiance and history. The food is alright, but there are far better steak places around town.
4 ||| I was in a wedding in May in MD and in my typical procrastination style, I waited a week before I was due to leave to get my bridesmaid dress altered.  I saw some good reviews of Christie's on Google or somewhere so I grabbed my dress and headed there shortly after it opened.\n \nIt was pretty crowded in there and a lot of older women in there Myers Park finest could not stop singing Christie's praises, I figured if its good enough for their designer duds its good enough for me!  And it was.  Christie had me put the dress on, made sure she marked where I wanted the hem cut to, made sure the dress would be brought in at all the right spots and told me we wanted it tight up top so the uh girls don't fall out!\n\nAfter we did that, I paid, $50ish I think which is waaay better than I have paid for other bridesmaid dress alterations, and even better she'd have it done by Tuesday morning (this was Thurs).  I was very pleased and I will definitely return!
3 ||| Blue Burrito is an average Mexican restaurant for quick sub par food. It is located in a shopping center that at one time used to be very popular before Kierland and Scottsdale Quarter were built. I would recommend the \"Build your own Burrito\" that way you can pick and choose what you want. They also offer a chips and salsa bar which makes it convenient for those who pig out on chips and salsa.
0 ||| This place SUCKS!  Every time I go in here it depresses the shit out of me.  People say it's haunted and I would agree - haunted by degenerates and meth heads.  I always say I'll never go back but that never happens...
2 ||| Beef and bottle always has wonderful food. The dim, secret, off- the- beaten -path atmosphere is also very attractive. However, I was underwhelmed by the service tonight. We spent $107 on dinner for two and the waitstaff was (kind) but rushing around all night, distracted and inattentive.  (btw they were.not busy) I.do.expect amazing service when paying a triple digit bill, which seems appropriate.  They did not talk about any of their menu options,brag about the specials or recommend a good wine.  A place like this deserves great service. We are hopeful though and will give it one more try.
3 ||| While in Vegas over the weekend, I wanted to get off the strip for at least one meal. On my way out of town, my friend and I stopped at the Coffee Pub (as influenced by Dave H's review). This place is very homey. When you walk in, it doesn't feel like anything special, but the people who work here are very friendly and casual. We sat ourselves and were served quickly (which was great because we needed to get home). The coffee was pretty standard coffee....nothing special for a place named after it. My friend had the pumpkin pancakes, which were good, and I had the croissant egg sandwich sub over medium egg. Mine was very good, but very homey... as in, I could make this at home. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were cooked well. It was good. Service was great, the woman who works there (owns it?) with the short hair knew everyone's names that came in and was very friendly...offered to bring out a coffee to go for me, which I appreciated. I noticed she physically touched just about each one of the customers (not in a weird way...just in a friendly way). The prices were good. I would consider going back when in Vegas.
1 ||| Okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a LOT to be desired. This issue is with the bartenders. A group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. The regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar. We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. Finally a woman greets us..imagine Janis Joplin and Joan Jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..She takes my order a single Amstel Light...she takes Carlos' order.. 2 drinks. She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! THEN give us waters..Ive never been so frustrated or irritated. It was almost laughable. Needless to say I didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..I wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway.
0 ||| Stayed here four times over five years. Each time it got worse. Was assigned a smoking room when we specifically asked for nonsmoking. They had a convention and said no other rooms were available. The room stank of smoke, was filfthy dirty with cigarette burns on the furniture, drapes and bedspread.  There were no toiletries. Asked front desk for housekeeping and they never came even after two requests.\nStay away!
3 ||| My husband and I were visiting from the Bay Area. At the time we were considering to relocate to Madison (which is hard given the weather differences) so I decided to explore the culinary options in the city (this is very important for me). We got the tasting menu with wine pairings. The food was good and the staff was very nice. \n\nWe have finally decided to relocate to Madison so I am looking forward to visit this place again. I hope the quality of their food and service is consistent.\n\n[During our visit we also tried the Blue Marlin and Otto's - we are going to miss the Bay Area's Cusine but I think we will survive]
1 ||| I'll acknowledge that Valentine's Day is a florist's busiest day of the year, and last-minute shoppers need to adjust their expectations accordingly.  But my experience with EHF was nonetheless subpar and beyond disappointing.  I called early in the morning (at 8 AM) and was advised that they were no longer accepting delivery orders for the day....completely understandable.  The lady on the phone invited me to drive in, though, saying she could accommodate a pick-up order.  I drove 25 miles into the store, had a vase, and just wanted to spend a minute walking around and putting together a quick arrangement.  I was told that I'd have to come back in an hour -- and the lady at the front desk was not sympathetic at all.\n\nAgain, I understand it was a busy day.  But if you couldn't accommodate two minutes of a walk-in customer, you shouldn't have invited me into the store.  \n\nThere was a happy ending, at least:  I discovered a great little florist a mile away who did immediately take care of me when I walked in and put together a beautiful arrangement.  http://www.flowersplusonline.com/  They're terrific!
2 ||| My coworkers and I order lunch here quite a bit. We call the order in and then pick it up. It seems almost every time we do that, our order is somehow incorrect. We're either missing a side of something or even a whole meal will be missing. \n\nThe food is good but if you're order is a carry out meal, make sure you check for everything before driving away!
3 ||| I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey, a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me.
3 ||| After hearing rave reviews of The Ribeye, I decided I would like to try this place. I was surprised that the restaurant was only open 5 and half hours every day and close by 9 or 9:30 every night. Weird concept for me... they would definitely receive more business by staying open a little later. \nWe did not make a reservation and walked in. Quoting us a 20-25 minute wait while there were four open tables to be seen we decided to wait and eat here. Seeing we were not leaving, the hostess seated us within 8 minutes. This was a Friday evening.\nOur waitress was extremely pleasant and took great care of us. We ordered a beer on tap and of course, the ribeye. Ribeye comes with choice of baked potato, steak fries, or rice and each couple gets a loaf of bread. Salad bar is free if you order an entree. The salad bar was great, but way too small. It had plenty of food but it was crowded with a lot of people on both sides reaching everywhere. It needs a different spot in the restaurant. \nI ordered the 8 oz. ribeye while my husband ordered the 12 oz. It was a good cut of meat and well-aged but it was just good. I expected my mind to be blown, but it was just a good cut of steak. \nWith two steaks and two beers our bill was $55. \n\nThe restaurant looks like something from the 70s... very odd, but comforting in a way.
0 ||| The food here is just plain terrible. Quantity is all they aim at while forgoing quality. I actually think this one and great impasta are by far the worst restaurants in town. As an Italian I can tell you this food has nothing what so ever to do with Italian cuisine.\nIf I could I would give them negative stars.
2 ||| Let's make this short...\n\nPlace was beautiful and clean. The Pho was so-so because mine came out pretty salty. Not much different Pho varieties. And I was a little bit confused about service. We didn't have one server we could talk to. There were multiple servers at a time. That makes it hard to ask for something if you needed it, or to get the bill.
1 ||| Boyfriend had his hair cut by Rosa this time since Emily wasn't in. Big mistake. He came home and I immediately began laughing at the horrendous mess on his hair; she faded his hair much higher than he asked and the top was really choppy. \n\nWe went to Emily the next day to fix it. Don't go to this place without asking for her.
4 ||| Food and service is always an A plus!!!!! We love coming here! Their salsa is bomb and food delicious! You have to try it :-)
2 ||| Nice try, but nothing memorable or worth going back for.
1 ||| I hadn't been there in about 9 years since my wife and I started dating (2nd date), and now I remember why.  The food is good, but way overpriced for what you get.  I got a very small piece of grouper (which was delicious) for $30, then had to pay $10 for a small salad.  My wife had a piece of chicken (thigh meat) for $24 and she was still very hungry afterwards.\n\nIf I am going to pay a decent amount of money for dinner, I want to at least be satiated.  The portion of fish should have been about 50% larger to make it worth the expense.  \n\nThe atmosphere was nice and not loud.\n\nI will just not be coming back.
4 ||| I was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out. Great service and really delicious sushi! The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. I got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good. I also got a rainbow martini, which was yummy. I'll definitely go back when I travel to Charlotte.
1 ||| I love Starbucks but this one is not so great. It's strange when there isn't a line and it's so LOUD that it's impossible to relax and/or get any homework done. It's always full of annoying kids. The only reason I keep going back is because it's literally 3 mins away from my place and the staff is super friendly and they usually do a good job making my coffee. They also have a nice outdoor seating area but I can never use it because it's usually too hot outside and lately it has been unusually cold. I really wish they had a drive-thru at this location!
2 ||| Spring Harbor has changed direction since my previous review.  Dr sondel was my reason for being there.  He is gone.  Not a bad place, but not the best anymore.
3 ||| REMODELED!\n\nWent in here on Friday afternoon to grab a drink, man... what a difference a remodel makes.  The upstairs is totally redone:  they \"un\"-blacked-out the windows and put frosting on it so it lets a lot more light in.... really opened up the space and also got rid of that weird \"stage\" level with the railing that had all the tvs and video games located on it.  The whole upstairs is totally one level... and is very open, inviting, airy, and chill.  There are new bathrooms upstairs as well so no more stumbling down dark stairs (you can see now!) to go use the restroom.\n\nI asked the barkeep how long ago the renovations had been completed and she said it had been about 3 months.\n\nThey also did away with the quick bar food type menu and have a chef.  Everything is homemade and delicious (according to the bar keep).  I ended up trying the pimento cheeseburger with bacon.... man I was not disappointed by the hype that the bartender put in me while telling me about this sandwich.  The great thing is that the food is Delicious and affordable.
1 ||| I used to go to this place weekly in 2006 and found the food to be excellent.  Went there yesterday before my flight and was severely disappointed even after ordering 5 different items.  I don't know if my taste buds have matured or if they have changed cooks.
4 ||| This place is tied with the Chuckbox for the best burger in arizona in my book! This is the way a burger was meant to be! Grilled over a wood fire, your choice of cheese and you add the toppings the way YOU want them! The fries are pretty good and the cheese sticks aren't bad either. Don't forget your punch card if you are a regular, I've already gotten one free burger!
1 ||| I made an appointment for 6:15, I wasn't taken until 6:45. The haircut took an hour, which I feel for a men's haircut is a little long. The cut wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible. I probably won't be back.
4 ||| I purchased a new Toyota at O'Brien in 2007.  I've had my car serviced there every time with the exception of getting an alarm system installed outside.  I've always found their service to be prompt, reasonably priced and friendly.  They have a generous drop off/pick up service while the have your car.  In addition they have done a small repair service not covered by warranty (battery drained) for free.  \n\nI think the price I paid for my car was fair but since they are the only dealer in town for many of the makes they sell (including Toyota), the prices are not going to be cut throat.
3 ||| Its hard to find good pizza in Scottsdale.  There's a lot of fluff restaraunts that spend more money on decor and advertising than quality chefs.  Ray's is basic.  But that's what you want.  You don't need to have 5 star seating with 1 star pizza.  This place has the best pizza within 10 miles.  The Sicillian is awesome, but so its the regular pizza.  Its the best of New York style without dripping fat or floppy dough.  Give them a try.  Its worth it.
4 ||| I have Been going to this place since high school and the food and drinks have never disappointed, you got to try the Spicy pork chop if you want a bit to eat or the Taro snow ice if you want a smooth sweet drink! Both are awesome!
4 ||| Aaron!!!  What a great waiter!!\n\nWe went in today, ordered up our appetizers (two chicken quesadillias, guacamole dip), and our free cheese crisp, that was in the Suns program.  Along with a total of four 99 cent margaritas - under $19.00\n\nAaron was on top of everything!  More salsa, more bean dip -- no problem!  Brought us containers, for our leftovers, down to little cups w/lids, for extra salsa.  Along with a bag, to carry it all home!\n\nThank you Aaron -- and to the nice young man, who greeted us at the door.  All good.  We will definitely will be back, when we are up in the area...\n\nPlus...........Aaron came running out the door, when I had stopped to look for my sunglasses; as he had picked them up while clearing the table.
3 ||| The Original Pancake House (OPH) is my 2nd favorite place for breakfast on the weekends (Pewter Rose is the first).  And they're one of the few Charlotte brunch options that opens before 10 a.m.  They offer an extensive menu of breakfast selections, including eggs, waffles, and, of course, pancakes.  \n\nSince I'm usually an egg person for breakfast, I'm usually steered past the pancakes and waffles and go right for the omelettes or other egg dishes.  Their omelettes are HUGE.  They seem like they're made from like 18 eggs or something.  None of the omelettes really seem to have a lot inside them (the ingredients aren't overflowing), but my favorite is the sausage one.  Also tasty are their seafood crepes and Eggs Michael (Eggs Benedict with sausage instead of Canadian bacon), as well as their regular Eggs Benedict.  And, last but not least, there's the Kosher meal:  eggs with salami and potato pancakes on the side.  YUM!  I'm not Jewish, but I do love a good Kosher breakfast!  (Miami has an awesome Jewish breakfast place, too, but I draw the line at \"tongue.\")  Potato pancakes are a delicious treat -- more tasty than hashbrowns, but not as filling as regular pancakes.  \n\nThis particular location of the OPH is across the street from the high-end SouthPark Mall, so you think it would be a little more stylish, but it's got that old 80s restaurant feel to it.  A renovation in decorating is definitely needed.  OPH should feel (and look) more like a diner.  I guess that's part of my reasoning for only 4 stars instead of 5.  \n\nIf you go on Sundays, be sure to get there before the church crowd!  Or you're looking at about an hour wait.
3 ||| Eating sushi in the desert...a dangerous undertaking, as evidenced by many evenings spent hunched over a toilet. Sometimes it just doesn't seem possible to get fresh fish in the valley of the sun. Well, thank goodness for the wonders of Sushi Kee. Somehow, their fish is always fresh and tasting of the ocean. Their rolls are yummy, their sashimi a wonder, even their tempura gets it right. Pricy? Yes...but I'm paying for the piece of mind that I WON'T be spending the rest of the night in a bathroom!
1 ||| Food was ok.  Their pho is good but served in plastic bowl, what a turn off.  Their shaking beef was dry and no taste.  It was a busy night but there should be no excuses, here.  They have some hispanic server who only know what being taught to them about the Vietnamese language and English.  There was a language barrier that I feel for the guests there with these hispanic servers in a Vietnamese restaurant.  I was charged a gratuity of 15% with 5 guests or more.  The lady cashier didn't want to give me the receipt for some reason, doubt!  She gave me short in change and didn't care to handle the transaction.  If I knew I would not put extra tips on the table.  The server was a nice guy with so much to do.  Free iced tea refill but he never came back to check on us.  How can a restaurant with a least 120 guests dined in with only 2 true servers to handle!  I would not not here again to this Mom and Pop restaurant.
4 ||| My mouth is salivating just from writing this review. I recently moved out of state and out of everything, friends included, Rito's Burritos are what I miss most. Juicy burritos full of flavor and filling as well... which means a lot to me because I eat like a man.\n\n...Although the staff all look/act like they're employed against their will... that's the only bad thing I can say about this place. Delicioso!
4 ||| Just an amazing and one of a kind organization.  The programs available with Freedom Personal Development are the pinnacle of personal development and coaching.  The Leadership, the speakers, and facilitators are some of the most effective professionals you could find across the country.  The Abundant Living Retreat is a must do experience that will transform a person's ability to achieve their most important goals in their life!  I absolutely recommend this company and it's leaders - Eric Plantenberg, Roger Seip, & Tom Weber!
1 ||| the whole idea of applebee's really bothers me. chain restuarants that you can go to all over the country just seem weird. it seems so much more worth it to try something new and unique and risk it not being great than going somewhere that introduced that obnoxious song about   baby back ribs... oh wait, that was chiles. well, i feel the same way about that restaurant too.\n\nthe only times i came here were to do their happy hour, which is pretty good, if you can stand the atmosphere. the HH hours are pretty impressive; 3 to 7 and 10 to midnight every night of the week. other than that - gross, gross, gross
3 ||| Apparently they used to wheel Aladdin round in a cart, and he'd say can I have one of these, one of these, and one of these for dinner, and point at everything he saw. That's where the expression \"Ala Cart\" came from. ;)\n\nGood middle eastern food in Pittsburgh - two locations - nom nom nom.\n\nWell this is pretty delicious, excllent Kofte Kebab.\n\nThey're pretty cheap, which is good, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I'll have to try some other things, but Kofte is my go to dish and they make a good one, not the best I've ever had but good. Bear in mind there is also one of these in Squirrel Hill, and others in nearby towns (I think there are one or two in Ohio too). \n\nBut as for their food, I'm impressed, now leave me alone and let me think of the names of at least 35 of Ali Baba's 40 thieves.
4 ||| Jury duty has me in downtown Phoenix 2 days a week. I have never spent much time in this part of Phoenix and have made it my lunch time focus to find a good place to eat or places. I wanted a burger looked on Yelp. Coney Island Grill was close. I liked the feel of the restaurant. It is small and the tables have sewed vinyl tops to cover the tables. I liked this touch. Made the tables look very cleaned.  I went in and asked the gentleman at the cash register I was wanting a burger but did he have any recommendations. He went through several items he liked and when he recommended the Bacon Cheese Burger. About the employees. While I was waiting on the burger I had a chance to watch how they treated their customers. All I can say is WOW. Everyone got the same great service I had received. The employees were very friendly and helpful to everyone. They get an A+ for customer service. My burger came out and it was very good. It was flavorful and just the right size. I especially liked the bun. Not sure what kind of bun it was but it really made the burger. Out of all the places I have eaten down town this is one of the places I am coming back to and trying something else off their menu. If you want good food and great customer service give them a try. You will like them. Now what am I going to try next. (I will probably just ask for another recommendation). Oh Oh. The price for a burger and a drink no fries?? $7.00 plus some change. Great value!!
0 ||| While visiting Vegas I wanted to give this place a try since I have friends suggesting it  to be one of the better Pho joint in town.  Unfortunately I can't seem to agree. The broth is what makes it or break it. It was dingy broth and all I tasted was salt. The meat wasn't fresh and the little amount of noodles that they gave was over cooked. Just didn't do it for me. :(
2 ||| I like this place and the lady owner but the husband never smiles or is friendly and doesn't seem very interested in helping.  I hate to write less than a stellar review for a place I basically like but one has to consider the whole experience.  The lady owner has always been friendly and helpful.  \n\nSome of the merchandise is very reasonable, other items are a bit higher than I might like, but I'm in the habit of hitting local thrift shops on their half off days so that affects my outlook.  I was looking at an Ergo front carrier infant insert which was priced at $21.50 and the lady said were $50 new, but had seen new ones at Target for $25. I'll have to go back and look again to be sure if it is the same model, the \"premium\" I think it was called.  We looked online and didn't see any new ones as high as $50.  They seemed to run $15 average for used ones on eBay and Amazon.  \n\nThe store recently moved to a different storefront a few doors down in the same center where they have LOTS more space! It's a lot easier to walk around and see things now.  \n\nAs far as condition, I didn't see anything that wasn't in really good shape, not that I looked at everything but what I did see was nice.  What we bought was absolutely like new.
3 ||| As I think of my $80 tab and try and remember anything memorable about the meal, I stare off into the distance and forget to breathe through my nose.....\n\nBeef bulgogi was run of the mill and the wee sized pot of steamed rice was, well, wee.\n\nNakji Dol Pan (Octopus stir fried with chili paste) was spiced properly and pretty tasty, but had no contrast and was getting monotonous\n\nTonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet) was pedestrian\n\nkimchi and accoutrement were also pretty bland.\n\neh\neh\neh
4 ||| This is 1 place I actually like even though yelp only has 3 and a half stars for it. This is a Korean BBQ spot to hit up if your in Vegas. You can order by entree or if your feeling adventurous you can cook your own meat. Like most people we want the food to arrive cooked. I ordered the bulgogi and short rib both dishes were amazing. Bulgogi is my favorite Korean dish. If you never had it, it's shredded like beef seasoned with Korean seasonings. Our entrees came with 5 or so side dishes like pickled tofu, beansprouts, kimchee and other goodies.
3 ||| It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. \nBest chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. \nI've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner.
4 ||| Best thing about this place is it's open 24 hours!!! The bf and I stayed at Stratosphere and would have late night snacks; of course, we didn't wanna travel outside of the hotel at 3am so, and this spot was perfect.\n\nThey had onion rings, shakes, malts, breakfast, burgers. It had that 50's vibe! Felt like I shoulda put on my best poodle skirt.\n\nService was pretty good considering these people were working at late night/early morning. And that place was pretty packed with people.\n\nNot complaining because it was better than I expected.
4 ||| I stopped by here after going to the Bookman's that on the same NW corner of Southern Ave & Country Club. I got a piping hot fish sandwich with light tarter sauce. It was yummy. The young man at the counter was very friendly, and the inside of the Arby's looked great. There is also a Goodwill and a 99 Cent Only store at that same complex. I included some photos in my review.
1 ||| I was not impressed by this Starbucks.\n\nI went every day during my PHX trip, and my drink was made incorrectly EVERY time. And then I was given attitude when I asked for it to be fixed- My drink doesn't even need to be remade to be fixed, just needs some classic syrup added. \n\nAlso, on one of the days, they were out of receipt paper. And instead of telling me, the cashier walked away. I was still at the register when she came back. That's when I found out...
1 ||| If you know the difference between a mexican cooking Italian food or an italian cooking mexican then you'll appreciate that Koreans really can't make authentic Japanese. To non-Japanese you may think this is good sushi but everything from the seaweed salad, green tea, and sushi are far from true, real Japanese in taste and texture. Basically to a Japanese person raised in Japan. This food is terrible. Like comparing Taco Bell to a real Taqueria. Don't be fooled find the real thing.
0 ||| vegi sandwich was slimy and didn't stay together. restaurant was dirty.  mirrors and pictures looked like they hadn't been attended to in a long time. floors and table were filthy.  no one was available to pick up plates or wipe tables down. I don't think I would return.
1 ||| I have banked at Nevada Federal, now One Nevada for the 10 years I have been in Vegas. The service has always been lackluster but has only gotten worse of late. I refuse to go to one of the \"bailout banks\" and am frustrated by the lack of options. Luckily I am a member of USAA and have opened an account there again after 10 years. I am in the process of winding down my accounts at One Nevada and frankly can't wait to be done with them.
4 ||| Hands down best shrimp ceviche in Las Vegas! I would come back over and over again just for that! My lobster tail in garlic butter was also delicious, happy hour on drinks was a plus. Be prepared to eat large portions when coming here, I was not expecting that much food!
1 ||| We went there on New Years Eve. My husband got fajitas, and I got quesadillas. My husband said his fajitas were very oniony, had a few spicy peppers, and very little anything else. My quesadillas were permeated with onions and spicy, spicy soggy green peppers (which I don't recall as being warned of those on the menu) so I took one bite and couldn't eat any more of it. It was gross and waaayyy too spicy for me to eat. The only thing I liked was my husband's strawberry margarita, which had booze in it, compared to my non alcoholic version (I'm pregnant). I had a sip of his and it was yummy. My daughter drank most of mine. She ate a lot of chips and wouldn't touch my quesadilla. We won't bother eating there again. What a bummer.
2 ||| The Good Egg is good! Shocker! You usually have to wait because it gets pretty busy, but the food is good, the service accommodating, and the atmosphere reminds me of a country home for some reason. Think of it is a notch up from Denny's. Which includes a little price increase, but it's still affordable. It's not a place I usually go because the waits were a little ridiculous and it's full of big loud families and old people.
2 ||| Friend invited me for a late lunch here. I had the Mozzarella, Local Tomato, & Basil sandwich. Sandwich was OK. I thought the Focaccia was a bit on the tough side. I'll have to give this place another try. I do want to purchase their bread to take home. Hope to return soon.
4 ||| What a great business. I've had mufflers added to my 1988 Mustang that sounded great. I had a stolen catalytic converter replaced on my 1999 Toyota 4 runner.\nboth times he did excellent work for a really good price. I highly recommend Mad Hatter.\nHe even said that I could bring in some rebar from home depot and he would weld it onto the new cat converter to prevent any future theives from stealing.
3 ||| I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years.  I have a great Dr. (Roseann Collins). And I find them to be organized and efficient.  Nothing but good experience with them.\nRichard
3 ||| This place was really pretty and I enjoyed most of my stay here.  Where it lost a star was the air conditioning in the rooms was really annoying.  Phoenix is hot and you really need good AC in a hotel that is in the middle of the desert.  At night, no matter how cold me set it, it kept shutting off and then turning back on 3 min later. But, the on/off kept waking us up. IN addition, it would get really warm and uncomfortable.  So, we had a terrible night sleep.\nAs for the pluses:\n-the views were gorgeous\n-the staff was friendly\n-they had a neat plan where if you opted out of housekeeping for a day they'd give you a $5 credit at the bar.  \n-there were a lot of amenities.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to take advantage of too many of them.
2 ||| I was ecstatic when I got an email regarding the return on Sweet Tomatoes in its original form as having turned into the Field Test Kitchen was a disaster. However, my excitement ended once I realized that many of my favorite items were either missing or changed. For example, the salad choices are now minimal so you don't get to make the salad actually as nutritious as you want. Also, I used to get Honey Mustard salad dressing and this time, the dressing was watered down and lacked any sweetness at all. \nNow if that was my only complaint, I would write that I would return but the hot section/ice cream station/soda station that they have seemed to cram into one small space is obnoxious and hard to maneuver around. For example, if anyone is refilling their drink and someone wants ice cream, everyone else must try and maneuver past them and it usually does not work out. Also, they took away the small ice cream cones that my son loved so he was bummed and the ice cream that was frozen yogurt before is now actually ice cream. I did not notice much of a change with the taste but my two year old that used to devour the frozen yogurt took two bites of the ice cream and told me that he did not want anymore. Now that is saying something.
3 ||| So my friends and I came here for two specific reasons: food on a stick and people watching.\nThose two purposes were well served! Steak on a stick, grilled corn, drinks....\nWe had fun watching people of all types (some even dressed as aliens??)\nMy only complaint is the price of EVERYTHING!\nIt was fun, but expensive (oh, and dirty). I blew through my money and got nothing to take home for it!\n Oh well, I got some sun and spent time with my friends. so it was definitely A-OK
3 ||| While it pains me to give any aquarium focused store a negative review, I'd rather not see people get blatantly ripped off.  Being new to the valley I drove out to this place last weekend, since it's the closest fish store to me.  It is quite large, one of the largest I've ever seen.  It's got that old school feel as well.  First thing I noticed is the selection sucks.  They have a lot of freshwater fish but that's about it.  Not a lot of aquarium plants or inverts.  Not much in terms of saltwater fish or coral which was mainly what I was after.  Second thing the prices are outrageous.  Everything I looked at was about double what I would expect to pay for quality livestock.  I'm always cautious of a aquarium store that can't put together a decent display tank and this place is no exception.
3 ||| Well, we hit this place up with a guest from out of town. Richardson's is usually our stop, but you know it burned down:(....\nEverything was great, except the service. The service was sort of not with it, but she did check on us and stuff. Just sort of \"lights on nobody's home\" head in the clouds. She wasn't horrible, but not what you expect when ordering a $22 entree. I like the prices and ambiance here, even better they took reservations for our party of 4. Overall its a great way to break out of the rut. Wish they'd opena lunch place with lighter offerings downtown.
4 ||| Simple need but they were quick and pleasant and right place at the right time.  Good job guys and thanks for your help!
3 ||| Tired after a busy day, I stepped out to find a bite to eat right around home, & landed here at Pancho's for the first time.  There was a big crowd on hand for dinner, but they did manage to squeeze me in within five minutes or so, to a very comfortable booth in a small, cozy dining room.\n\nThis place has TONS of atmosphere!  It consists of a number of tastefully decorated & lighted small & medium sized dining rooms, with low ceilings & archways separating each room.  There are tables, booths, & 1/2 & 1/2, depending upon the room.\n\nChips & salsa arrived at my table soon, along with a glass of water, & my friendly waitress appeared shortly thereafter, to drop off a menu.\n\nThere is plenty to choose from here, & the prices are very reasonable.  For about $8, I had a combination plate with a chile relleno, a cheese enchilada, & a green corn tamale.  (Lunch prices are even less.)\n\nEven though they were busy, my order arrived in a reasonable amount of time, served on a piping hot platter.  I wasn't crazy about my food in particular, but I think it'll be 4-Stars if I order the right items. I did enjoy it enough return, for sure!
4 ||| My husband I went there last night, with some out of town guests.  What a great time we had!  Drinks were very good priced and a live band, no cover charge, and what a Great time we had.  We will be going back here again, we loved it.
2 ||| Viet food is below average. Service is great. Price is too high for mostly unfavorable viet food. I am from Los Angeles, I know good Viet food, this place is just average.\nI recommend you go down the street at Krung Siam for favorable Thai food with actual spices and the pricing is very fair.
3 ||| I hired Blossom Basket for my wedding flowers.  The person I met with initially was Carla, and she was very professional and experienced.  She was patient and helpful as I struggled to figure out my flower design.  The second time I went in, I was paired with a different employee.  She was young, and perhaps inexperienced, but also very difficult to work with.  She didn't like any of my ideas and just didn't seem to want to work with me to find a solution if my ideas weren't going to work.  She was rude and short with me at times.  For the final consultation, I made sure to request Carla, and all was right with the world!  The flowers turned out great, and compared with the other places I looked at, they were very reasonably priced.
3 ||| Their pancakes are awesome with specialty flavors. Their omelet is very weak. If you come for the pancakes you will be very happy, anything else and I think you will be sorely disappointed.
2 ||| Came with roommate. Stood in entryway for 5 minutes. Chose a random table and sat for 5 minutes. Staff made eye contact with us and still chose not to address us. And so we left. Spare yourself the trouble.
2 ||| When pulling up to this restaurant I had a great feeling. Such a pretty setting.... And that was the best thing I experienced here. The staff was rude and the food was not worth the price. It started with the host telling us that the patio was closed, even though we called at 3:30 earlier to verify we could have patio seating at 7:30. Did I mention that it is march in Phoenix and 75 degrees. Reluctantly, we were sat on the patio but the server made sure we paid for his inconvenience. He had to open an extra door. Every question or request was met with a snappy comment. We end up asking for a new server and the manager was mildly sympathetic. We would have left right away if we were not with other dinner guests and very hungry. They brought one of our guests the wrong meal and the food was good but not great. Over priced in my opinion. That being said the discounted our $300.00 bill by $75. I don't plan to go back anytime soon. If you choose to go here, good luck.
2 ||| The boubo tea....is soso,but the food is ok... i dont want go back again..
0 ||| Just an update, I still have two horrible months to go before I can get the hell outta this damn place! Have had multiple issues since and must say the only resolved one is my damn a.c. now that its cool! Calling is still useless, yet walking into the office your met with fake high pitched happiness or cold I dont give a fuck ignorance. Maintenance orders I put through weeks ago are yet to be completed, \"waiting on parts\". \nGetting an explanation of any charges will result in Maya printing out an invoice for YOU to figure out what you've been charged! I mean wtf kinda place is this?!? If the rent wasn't in the damn 900-1000 I wouldn't be so pissed but its absolutely criminal that they can advertise what they do and call themselves luxury apartments! Can't wait till damn January!!!!!
3 ||| The experience would have been a lot more enjoyable if I wouldn't have had to get my own refill of water and eat chip crumbs. The chile rellenos and beef tacos are good though.
2 ||| Lunch buffet during the week
0 ||| In the last several years, imaging centers are popping up everywhere.  The market has become saturated.  With that in mind, logic would say that to remain competitive, customer service is the number 1 priority?  As well as strong techs,innovative equipment and competent Radiologists to read the exams.  Because I do know that the latter of the those reasons are true, I agree to go to Simon Med for an Ultrasound.  \n\nWhat's with the whole check in time vs appt time?  Does it really take you 15 mins to put my order into folder with a face sheet?  You already have my current insurance info and assume you have verified.  Then i wait.....in the SMALL reception area where they have a musical movie BLASTING on the TV.  It was disturbingly loud!!  As I sit there, squirming not only from the annoying sound, but also because this exam required that I drink and hold 30 oz of water!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   To make matters worse, the receptionist comes into the room from around here barrier, to only turn the volume on the TV louder!!!!!  I thought it was a joke?  More time passes and I finally approach the uninviting ladies behind the shield and politely ask when should I expect to be called back for my exam?  \"ahhhh what's your name?\"   yeah idiot I just checked in 20 minutes ago...way to pay attention.  Brilliantly, she responded \"I have no idea, I have not seen an US tech\".  I wanted to unload my 30ozs right there.  I then explained how uncomfortable this was as well as inhumane!  It's not a good medical practice to allow someone to hold their FULL bladder for too long.  \n\nAfter another 20 mins, I gave up, more concerned with my health and feeling like i was being punished by the loud, annoying movie playing.  \n\nThe staff is rude, they clearly over book as I was suppose to be the first morning appt, and they are taking risks to allow any patient to sit there for close to an hour holding 30 ozs of water.  I took my order back and rescheduled my exam across the street at SMIL.  My referring Dr. had offered me the choice of imaging centers for my exam.  I called him immediately upon my departure from Simon to let him know about my horrendous experience.  i can assure you, he will no longer refer patients there.
0 ||| This place is filthy.  The doctor I had was completely negligent in correcting a problem she had created.  I found a doctor in Bloomington and had to undergo surgery to correct what was done terribly wrong while I was a patient at Christie Clinic.
4 ||| My husband and I have been here twice - for anniversary celebrations. It truly is a 5 Star experience. My husband has worked in the food and restaurant industry for over 20 years and now compares everything to Kai - which is completely unfair! We have had the short story, as well as various other menu items. Everything is fabulous - presentation, flavor, the attention to detail...\nMenus are designed by native artists, the table decor, the interior, etc. - all inspired by and/or done by Natives of various tribes. \nThe service is impeccable - all employees are very knowledgeable & attentive. And the finishing touches (bottled water, a hand-signed note from our attendant & chocolates in the car that was pulled up from valet) was so personal. Kai amplified our anniversary celebrations! We hope to be able to visit again!
3 ||| ahhh, honey bear's.  i'm not sure where the name comes from, but i am sure the food is DARN GOOD.  the meat is ridiculously tender.  the sauce is good, runny, but good.  somehow i end up consuming a couple tubs of it without realizing.\n\nthe proportions aren't very big, for the sandwiches or the sides, but i guess you can argue that it helps you to not over-eat.  prices are pretty fair though. and again, the taste...mmm...\n\nthey cater too, which is pretty amazing when you show up somewhere and it's buffet honey bear's time!
4 ||| Great views, quiet neighborhood. However weird unknown fees that bother me. Been here only a couple of months but I love it, it is a little away from downtown Scottsdale.
4 ||| Yum! The food at all Oregano's is always delicious and I'd have to say the same about this location. Both the food and service is good here. It is very consistent with other locations.\n\nIt also is consistent with most other locations in parking - or lack there of. Unfortunately, this is just something you have to take with most locations.\n\nOtherwise, great place to go! You can usually get two meals out of your entree, too!
0 ||| Terrible! Don't believe all the hype. This is for OB.  The tour sounded great, of coarse once we actually had the baby totally different story.   The nurse told me they ran out of pillows. How does a hospital run out of pillows? Then she yelled at my spouse to not help me sit up when i needed his help because her lazy ass would not help me. She literally stuck me in a room and left me there.  I was just lucky that my wonderful mom who is also a nurse from a different hospital came to help me. \n\nThank god the shifts changed and they replaced my terrible nurse with an amazing one (she gets five stars).  \n\nSo did things get better after I had the baby? No! More terrible nurses came to pretend help me.  One nurse even said she needs to take my baby because the labs are running behind then walked out of the room with my baby. Which i was told on the tour would never happen.\nI called my husband and made him hunt her down and bring the baby back.\n\nThey forgot to get me my dinner, its okay i only just delivered. \n\nOne nurse told me my baby was too cold and took the baby to warm the baby up after she blamed me for it. Then came back and said that she could not get my babies body temp up and gave the baby back to me. You know why!?!  Because my baby was not COLD!!!! \n\nOne woman, who was nice but annoying spent a hour trying to get my baby to latch. My baby would not because she was SLEEPY!! Once the nursing police left my baby latched on her own 5 hours later.\n\nSo overall...staff was lazy, rude, annoying, incompetent, and pushy. \n\nHad i know this i would have went to a different hospital.
3 ||| Even if you have been to a Bashas'markets Inc before, you must go to this one! You could spend hours here, eat dinner, have a drink, and shop. Obviously the groceries can be pricier, but that's expected if you go in the first place. Expect to spend an additional 10-15% but probably worth it.
1 ||| This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in the EV now it's a great shame. Menu has changed slightly but the quality is on serious decline!
4 ||| People's Indian is a solid traditional Indian place. Offerings are standard, but well done. I like their bindi masala and vegetable korma. In meat offerings, their lamb is really quite good.\n\nTheir lunch buffet has a solid selection of both meat and vegetable dishes and includes samosas, which not all buffets do. Also included is chai, which is good (if overly sweet).\n\nIn general, it's one of the better local Indian places. The service is also pretty consistent and pleasant (unlike, say, India Garden where the service is consistently horrific).
2 ||| Alright kids here goes,\nThe first time I went to massage pro it was amazing! I had a therapist I believe by the name Kerry and everything was perfect, all the way down to the price and the way her room was set up. It was dark, tranquil, she had nice music, just as a massage should be. When  booking my second appointment there they didn't even ask for my request of who I wanted a massage with, they just assigned me a lady. Once I got there I could not wait to receive the same treatment, and I was seriously, utterly LET DOWN.\n\nThe new lady I had was not at all at the level of where Kerry was. Her room was bright with the sun coming in, and her room was cluttered! How can you relax and enjoy your time when you are in a room literally covered top to bottom in STUFF!? Not to mention my entire massage she kept on talking to me, I paid for this hour to relax not talk. Do not get me wrong the lady was sweet, but it was simply not right for a massage. She also kept doing things without even asking or letting me know, such as throwing a scalding hot towel under my neck, or putting lotion around my hair line. I was quite frustrated and irritated by the time I left, and also was 60 dollars poorer.\n\nMy advice if you have already been and loved the experience, MAKE SURE you request the same person. If you have not been you are going to have to gamble with the fact that not all of these therapists are at the same level or practice in the same way.
4 ||| The best part about living in this part of Chandler is being very close to what many call the \"Asian Mecca\" of the east valley.\n\nThere's no shortage of delicious restaurants, grocery stores, tea shops, etc. and you'll be lucky if you get to try them all. Maybe this should be my next bucket list?!\n \nThat being said, since I moved here just over a year ago . . . I'm kicking myself for not trying Tokyo House sooner! \n\nWhen you walk in, it's rather empty. Not a lot of d\u00e9cor, but very clean. Don't let the lack of business scare you away. 102.5 KNIX playing in the background; love it!\n\nThe best part of this place is the little old man / owner. He is a riot, very happy and cheerful. Cares about his customers. If you don't know what you're ordering, he'll happily show you a book with pictures. He also suggested we get the combo, as it comes with a drink, egg roll, your dish for just under $7. \n\nThe Dude and I decided to share the Orange Chicken and Chicken Yakisoba.\n\nHo lee f Batman, best Orange Chicken ever! That other establishment on the other side of Chandler can suck it, because this stuff was amazingly fresh! You could tell someone actually went to the trouble of using fresh oranges instead of some corn syrup-y, jarred garbage.\n\nThe owner also said he could make it spicier for us, which was great!\n\nI also really enjoyed the Yakisoba, but will ask for double noodles next time as it's served on white rice.\n\nAll of this came out to around $15. \n\nTip: They're closed on Sundays. \n\nCan't wait to try their Teriyaki, Orange Beef, and other dishes. Would make for easy take out.
1 ||| I really like this place.  The Children shows are awesome so when I heard of the adult shows I thought it would be brilliant.  I WAS WRONG...\nI had actually spoken to the staff prior to attending the show, they told me something along the lines of it was for adults, not for the easily offended, but nothing xxx.  I was miss informed... \nI'm not easily offended.  I am also a fan of stand up comedy.\nI am not sure where to start.  I guess they feel that since its for adults they should say s**t every other word.  The first half had sketches that were decent at best, some entertaining.  I laughed once or twice.  Some of the puppeteers were really good at animating their puppets.  All and all 1st half was eh 2-3 out of 5.\nWell then there was intermission and the second half began.   Oh boy where to begin where to begin.  It was so slow and boring.... The Tucson Puppet Works should really look into another hobby.  The puppets were poorly made.  It was just bad.  I think I heard maybe one or two people laugh during the entire thing.  For about 4 minutes it was just puppets having sex.  It was boring.  Team America Puppets having sex funny, this, well this was crap.  I kept hoping it wold be over and the new sketch would start.  It kept going and going... I finally stole a program from the person sitting next to us.  When I saw that the Tucson Puppet Works had the entire second half of the show, we stood up and walked out.  \nChildren Shows Awesome! Adult Slams... I guess the best way to describe it would be Painful. Extremely PAINFUL!
4 ||| Great and fast service, excellent beef tips and fried pickles!
2 ||| Edit: New ownership noticed 2008. \n\nTasty Indian cuisine with a British influence. Pub side has mostly British ales and are served in traditional, Imperial pint glasses.\n\nFood is average and in line with most Indian Cuisine in the Phoenix area. Chana Masala with garlic naan is an exceptional combination at this location. Appetizers are high quality as well. \n\nPrices/portions are on par for most restaurants.\n\nService is about average as well - sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes poor.
4 ||| Fabulous!
0 ||| I came in here at 2am to be seen for a horrendous sore throat that hadn't been letting up for a few days. After being there for 3 hours, the doctor told me I was suffering from post-nasal drip, and there was nothing to help me. I ended up calling in sick to work the next day, and at 10am called my PCP. Thankfully, I was told to come in right away. Upon being seen by him, he took one good look at my throat, told me I had a bad case of bronchitis and laryngitis, gave me a 3 day Z-pack, and I started to feel better just hours later.\n\nThanks for nothing, Concentra. Including wasting my money for no actual services received!
3 ||| Friendly staff. Not sure why I continue to use the drive through. If there is a long line, it's quicker to pull into a stall and order.
1 ||| Very bland food, no flavor.  Unimpressed. Quiet atmosphere. Will not be return.
1 ||| Very disappointed that they took off the lime chicken on 2 for 20 so I don't go there anymore.  Service so so and the cocktails are pre measured an weak. Better places to go.
1 ||| You know you are in a bad section of town when the greeter at the Walmart doesn't even smile back at you or say \"Welcome to Walmart!\" when you walk in.  I mean, they get PAID to do that!   And I always smile and say hi to them.\n\nNor was the cashier in any way friendly when I checked out.  I only went here because the very nice gal at the one on Rural said this one had a bigger inventory and might have what I was after.  I'll never go back here unless enough time goes by that I forget this bad experience.   \n\nNo wonder this place has such bad reviews.
0 ||| You tricked me Sam's Town. I fell for the 9.99 (with card) all you can eat Prime Rib\nbuffet. EWWWWWWW. . The best part about this buffet was the fountain drink.  The \nPrime Rib was bland and overcooked. The green beans were frozen, the pasta \nwas horrible, and the rice was too salty. The Mexican fare was beyond crappy. Frozen tacquitos, canned re fried beans, and greasy machaca were some of the choices available.  Having lived in Las Vegas for almost 7 years, I have been to a number of buffets. However, none were as god-awful as this one.
4 ||| I was told about this place by the folks in the Arizona Steampunk Society. We made the long drive to Mesa to visit and I'm glad we did. They have a great selection of western goods, both old west and modern, and the prices are fair. \n\nThe staff is very attentive. We had at least four people stop to see if we needed help. Everyone was friendly.
1 ||| Got my rear bumper 'fixed' there and a couple weeks after I got the car back, I noticed that the paint was cracked and chipping in four different places across the bumper.  They also forgot to put the fuel tank rubber seal back after fixing fender.  The lady looked at the bumper and said that someone probably hit my bumper and they don't cover chips caused by outside sources.  There was absolutely no sign of bumper flexing or denting and regardless, the paint was chipping way too much to have been properly done.  She also said I couldn't verify they were at fault for losing the rubber seal so it wasn't their problem.  And then she just went back inside.  Save yourself of dealing with a crappy maaco-grade paint job and a good-for-nothing \"lifetime quality guarantee\" and invest in a quality shop.  \nTook my other car to gallo-miller and it was much, much better quality of workmanship and customer service.
4 ||| This place is full of treasures !!!!!
2 ||| Quick Question, What are your hours of operation?? \nI need some fabric and have a tight schedule, therefore I must plan ahead.\n\nThank you!
1 ||| Been going here for specialty boat items for 10 years spanning ownership of 4 boats. Ordered something from a VERY helpful gentlemen last Saturday. I got a message the part had arrrived in precisely the time I was told... I show up to an empty store with 2 employees attending to a pallet of product. One asks me if I need help and I explain I'm there to pick up a special order part... He says \"OK.\" and proceeds to put his hands in his pockets and talk to the girl attending to the pallet. 2 min later the girl begins walking towards us and asks my last name... She doesn't here me apparently and borderline yells \"WHAT?\" at me. After repeating, she gets the part, tosses it on the counter, charges me and says, \"Thanks\" in a smart tone while walking away. Marine Max 1 mile away just got all of my business. You're welcome for a decade worth of business. Too bad you tossed it on a $3.16 part.
1 ||| I know Sonic isn't a typical fast food place - you never go inside - but still, the employees need to be a little more cognizant of the fact that we can still see what you are doing.\n\nStopped there for lunch today and was parked in a stall right outside the door. I watched (after I had received and eaten my food) one of the guys that works there bring a bag of trash outside and set it down by the door. Then I watched as he went and got another bag and did the same thing. Not a minute later, he came out the door with a tray of food in his hands to deliver to a car. Hmmmm... enough time to wash your hands or no?\n\nAlso, why put the trash right by the door instead of taking it to the dumpster? Which was a few feet away, and he's on roller skates! It's not like he even had to walk there.\n\nRight before I left, I watched a girl come out and walk right by the two bags of trash to go have a cigarette. Where she proceeded to stand right next to the dumpster. Hello? Take the trash with you maybe? \n\nThe food was good - no complaints there. But still - do something about the health and safety aspect of this place.
4 ||| There was this little sandwich shop just around the corner from my office that had the most amazing chicken and sausage gumbo, plus a number of fine sandwiches.  But sadly they shut it down about a month ago and I've been at a loss for a good lunch place ever since.   Besides having some great lunch food, the owners and staff were fantastic and are missed.   HOWEVER, the owners also have another place that is doing great, and its Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen.   So I drove the 10 minute drive and can't imagine why I waited until now to visit them.   The food was incredible, the menu has many more choices, and a dessert of bread pudding about put me into a food coma!    The gumbo is perfect every time, and the Shrimp Po'Boy was excellent with the horseradish sauce.   And it was sure nice to see both Heidi and Heather again!   \nI'll continue to miss their sandwich shop, but I will definitely be making the short drive over to Baby Kay's again.    \nGet there a little early, they had a line forming around noon, so lots of other people like the place too!
0 ||| I'm not a huge fan of Au Bon Pain in general, but this one in particular is the worst. I walked in to find every employee on their phone, yelling across the store to eachother. Worse, yet, the entire store, from the door way, smelled of vomit. I made it to the line, but had to turn around as the smell was so pungent. I cannot speak to the product, but I can say, I would never go in there again.
2 ||| I'm not a huge pizza fan, so my review may be a little biased based on my taste. But I do enjoy an occasional pizza pie, & Fuel just isn't impress me all that much.\n\nI've eaten at this Fuel in downtown Charlotte for late night several times & the place is always packed. They're open after the bars close, so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte, Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed, & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.\n\nOnce you get to the front of line, they have a lot of pizza topping options, from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices, they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food, the pizza is nothing special, especially considering your wait. To me, it's just your average, run of the mill pizza.\n\nI'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza, but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping, then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger.
1 ||| I've been to Flo's multiple times and not had a super positive experience.\n\nI ordered the \"spicy thai coconut milk soup\" assuming it was tom ka and the soup that came out was more like orange-colored hot water. No taste, no spice either. It looked akin to the plastic heatable containers of tomato soup you can buy at a grocery store. I've also ordered with brown rice before and was served white rice, which was easy to fix but in retrospect, another negative mark. I came here with my parents once and ordered hot green tea which came as a small cup (and only a small cup) and that showed up on the bill as like $2. Then the potstickers are like $5 for 4 of them and they're probably just potstickers purchased from the nearby Trader Joe's market. To be honest, the only reason why I even come here now is because someone else is paying.
2 ||| I like the comparison to Lady & the Tramp that Nathan S. made in his review. This place totally reminds me of that scene too with the red & white checkered table cloths.\n\nThe service at Anzio's is usually very good.\nThe salads are very good.\nThe bread is good.\nThe pizza and the other dishes are just ok.\nThe beer selection is lacking, no good micro-brews (get some Sierra Nevada, New Belgium beers or at least some Four Peaks, would ya?)\n\nAnd that's all I've got to say about that
4 ||| Let me tell you about a great experience I had at Kierland Golf.   Yes, the course is beautiful and so well maintained, but I had a free afternoon, but not enough time for a round of golf, and instead of the usual resort spa experience like a massage, I decided to see the golf pro for a lesson.\n\nIn one hour, the pro with the aid an I Pad app,  was able to set me on a path to correct a serious swing flaw that I knew had to be present but I couldn't detect on my own.  He gave me two great and easy drills to get me hitting the ball straighter and longer.\n\nSo, if you visit the Kierland, be sure to get some great instruction from Heath.\n\nNow I need to practice :-)
3 ||| I heard good things..after all Primanti Brothers have developed a nice chain in the area.\n\nGreat service very helpful...I had the guys pick the sandwich for me.  I got There best selling burger....it was a hamburger with fries in it.   Not a fan of the idea.  Overall kinda boring(Sorry) but it is what it is.  The meat tasted like meat which was a nice change but the toppings were just down right sad.  Fries where a  step up from the norm and for a price of under 7 bucks it sure beats any fast food chain.
2 ||| I had dinner here while visiting the Biltmore, nice ambiance, on the dark side, sat at the bar and ordered the meatloaf, a big portion but a bit too sweet for my taste why they put so much ketchup in it I don't get. My salad was good, dessert totally sucked, \nI ordered the carrot cake and it looked like it came from a super market, what they dont realize is it should be served room temperature not out of the fridge, or it should be warmed. Still, for a five star resort the dessert was pretty sad looking and tasting...\nI might try this place again during another visit, but I was not impressed.
0 ||| This one sucks! No selection and they are expensive! Not worth it, don't waste your time going here.
3 ||| With all the places in Bloomfield you can probably do better.\n\nA couple of my friends and I wanted drinks and food around 9 on a Friday and Bloomfield is one of our favorite neighborhoods.  We figured we'd park and just see where we ended up.  After trying a couple of favorites and finding them too jammed packed we settled for Lot 17.  \n\nService wasn't anything special and lacked any emotion.  Like any.  I've been here before and remembered this to be true in the past as well.  \n\nAs for the food, it's just decent.  Cheap and decent.  I had the stuffed peppers and some beer.  The peppers were amazingly hot, too hot to enjoy.  But the stuffing was good, yet they were watery.\n\nMy buddy had the cajun chicken sandwich and said it was good, his sweet potato fries helped cool my tongue, yet were a shoulder shrug.  Seemed frozen.\n\nA shoulder shrug could be used to describe Lot 17.
2 ||| I'm not from the South, so you may say I'm crazy and chalk this review up to, \"she's a Yankee\", but Dish didn't impress this girl.\n\nLet's start out on a high note, though, shall we? The potato cakes were seriously delicious...I had honestly never heard of (much less tried) one of these delectables before coming to Dish (I know, I know...Yankee), and was...well, I can't say pleasantly surprised, because there's nothing surprising about something in the mashed potato family being yummy, but was delighted nonetheless. It was all down-hill from there...\n\nThere was nothing horribly and obviously wrong with the meal...let me say that up front. Well, service kinda sucked, but as far as the food goes, it wasn't overtly awful. It was...hmm, how do I explain this? You know when you were a kid, and you'd go to your friend's house for dinner, and their mom would cook, and you'd eat the food because it was there and you knew you were supposed to, but all you kept thinking the whole time was how it just wasn't how your mom made it? That's something akin to how I felt about Dish -- it was passable, but the whole time I kept thinking that I could get better pot roast almost anywhere else (such as Jar restaurant in L.A...now THAT is pot roast!!). \n\nOverall it was just sub-par...like they had somebody's mom in the kitchen making it. I love moms, don't get me wrong....but moms aren't chefs! They're moms. I expect higher quality and better presentation from a chef that I'm paying for my food.\n\nI'm willing to give it another chance...like I said, perhaps I'm being too harsh (living in a city with some of the best cuisine in the country spoils me, I know), but I personally think Dish needs to step up their game. Who says comfort food can't be exquisitiely prepared and superbly delicious? Not me!
4 ||| Super nice staff, clean establishment and GREAT food. Definitely recommend it and will be back again.
4 ||| When I moved to Arizona 2 years ago, I visited many veterinarians to find one I liked.  Out of all of them, only Pecan Grove took the time to give me a tour of their offices.  I met most of the staff that day, and they were all very friendly.  They were also very proud of the fact that they were painting and doing various improvements to the office themselves, which I thought showed their dedication.\n\nEvery visit, me and my dog were treated like family.  Out of all the veterinarians I have used over the years, I felt the staff was the best, and that includes one veterinarian that I knew personally in Connecticut.\n\nRecently, I made the decision that I needed to euthanize my dog  due to age and health problems.  The staff were all very respectful, and supportive.  They made a very difficult situation as painless as it could be given the circumstances.  The thing that stood out in my mind the most, I received a personalized condolences card a few days later.  That small gesture reenforced my feeling that they truly cared. \n\nI will definitely use Pecan Grove Veterinary hospital for any future veterinary needs.
4 ||| This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. I like the food here because it's not catered to only Americans, the recipes are actually authentic.  The service was great!!!  Eating here on Sundays are good, they have a variety of Chinese and Vietnamese food at the buffet!\n\nPho: good\nEggrolls: yummy!!!\nrice plates: the pork chop was the best!\nNoodles and grilled beef: scrumptious\nAvocado shake: excellent!\n\nThere are many more dishes on the menu, however those are the few that I always order.
3 ||| The Lincoln Trail Library system is well-designed, and if the Champaign Pub Lib doesn't have what you need, they'll find a way to connect you with someone that has the book or whatever material you want/need. Also, they have a rather fantastic collection of CDs. This is a great place to study on a quiet afternoon, but also near finals, it can be a nice place to escape from campus and your apartment. It's also wonderful to be there when working on a paper or project where a seemingly endless number of resources are needed. Big tables are great for spreading out. \nAll of this said, be careful because they are rather strict about which library you've got a card to (it all depends on where you live) and they are also a little strict about cleanliness, etc. Lots of money was spent on this library, though, so I believe it's warranted.\n\nAlso: WiFi is free, but only if you have a library card. Not sure how it works if you do not have a library card.
4 ||| Everything we were served from appetizers through deserts had wonderful and memorable flavors.  The staff was friendly and knew the menu and the wine list inside out.  Using of ingredients from local sources and providing information about the people and places things come from is an excellent touch.  The atmosphere is quieter than some other restaurants which means that you can focus on the great food and converse in a normal voice.  All in all, this was one of the best two or three meals I have had in ten years.
4 ||| First time here and I couldn't be happier. Great recommendations without being pushy about sales. Quick in and out service and super friendly guys. A+ service and experience!
3 ||| I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\n\nHere?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\n\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\n\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \n\nThere are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.
3 ||| I like the Bamboo Club, but it doesn't seem to bode well with purists. It is a very Americanized spin on Chinese food, with some dishes it works well and others not so much. \n\nI struggle with a fierce addiction to Panda Express so I refer to it from time to time, but I feel I'm justified this time. Bamboo Club is like a deluxe version of Panda Express. In fact, their best dish is also the orange chicken, only done much more tastefully than their greasy counterparts. \n\nIt's a little overpriced considering what they are offering (semi-glorified mall food) but, all in all, not bad.
0 ||| Went to Sushi 101 last night as part of my quest to try all the sushi restaurants in Charlotte, and I gotta say that I won't be going back. I was expecting a lot more of a restaurant with such a good location right on the water and between the Hilton and FireWater, but I'm pretty sure this place just serves grocery-store quality sushi and you pay to look at the lake while you eat. \n\nThe restaurant itself was filthy (the floor looked like it hadn't been swept in weeks) and the decorating was your average dollar-store kitschy Asian junk. It was a little crowded when we arrived and we were seated at a small, very wobbly table in the middle of the restaurant. It seemed like they were wasting some space with the table arrangement, and the other side of the restaurant had big leather couches instead of chair...? Considering the general sloppiness of the place, I shudder to think about those couches. The menus were poorly designed laminated things and filthy, and the rolls were a little expensive ($9+ for maki, generally $3 more than other nearby places).\n\nThe sushi was unremarkable to outright unpleasant. We ordered the Crispy Bagel, the Ninja Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and one Kani nigiri. The rolls came out quickly and the server was sweet but not too professional (as we were leaving she was sitting at a nearby table with other servers gossiping loudly). The presentation of the rolls was sloppy and not even slightly elegant as sushi should be. The bagel roll was good but pretty much a standard bagel roll, except it had Japanese mayo on it instead of eel sauce, which was sort of unusual (and not in a good way). The rainbow roll was also your stock rainbow roll, nothing special. The ninja roll was room temperature even though it was supposedly a baked roll and it honestly tasted like the fish had gone bad; I only ate a few pieces before I couldn't stomach it, and later that evening I had some serious stomach issues that I'm attributing to this place. The crab salad handroll was very dry and tough, and there was no \"salad\" about it, it was just shredded crab. The rolls were loosely assembled so that they fell apart when you picked them up, the rice was dry, the sauce was scarce, and whatever brand of soy sauce they use is no good. \n\nMaybe I just happened to visit this place on the absolute worst day, but I'm not willing to give them a second chance after this disappointment.
1 ||| Employees friendly, but do a terrible job cleaning. I rather deal with the long waiting at Fabulous Freddy across the street.
3 ||| Ok since I'm right across the street I've used this guy simply because a good upholsterer is hard to find. Zero complaints with his work. HOWEVER he is a cranky old man who thinks he knows it all and will not work with you - Eg: Just recover a seat on a truck you're reselling as cheaply as possible. Guess business is good enough to be that way. But like I said, the work is great so if you can handle the attitude go for it.
1 ||| I love to support local business but CR needs some improvement. 2nd time here. Very slow service this time. Family kids help which can be good and bad. My wife got beef with her order. She can't eat beef. When we asked if it was pork they said yes. Well it was beef and now she is sick. Oh well. When they are full they can't handle the volume. Nice family but hire some help for peak times and when someone asks what is on their plate know what you are serving.  We won't return.
0 ||| I went into this Buckle store looking for some jeans and had an awful experience!!!  The sales people bombarded me with things to try on and insisted that I show them everything so they could give me fake compliments. Once they realized that I wasn't going to buy anything, they seemed really annoyed and kept questioning me as to why I didn't want the jeans. I didn't even get a chance to look around- they just picked out stuff they thought I would want. My boyfriend was there with me too and had to contend with the guy sales associate while I was in the dressing room. He was just there waiting for me and started getting harassed about trying on some $130 jeans. He said that he wasn't interested and told the guy that he didn't really have the money anyways...\n\nBeing shocked about the experience I had, I looked online at reviews that other people have posted and was surprised to see that some people actually like to be stalked while they're shopping and think that's good service! I will never go into another buckle store again and hope this place goes out of business.
3 ||| As I am sitting in legacy urgent care waiting for a doctors visit I thought I would put together a review. Like any doctors office, no one wants to be here. We all just sit and wait to be called so the doctor can do his/her poking and prodding. \n\nThe place is clean and very simple. I wouldn't say the staff is the friendliest but they are quick to process patients through the system. That's all that matters. In and out, quick and easy... what more could you really want.
2 ||| Please read everything below. It is quite verbose.\n\nHello,\n\nMy name is Greg Swartz.\nI am writing you to express my dis-satisfation of the pizza we received, the jalapeno poppers we received, and the customer service we received.\n\nI live in Colorado Springs, but am visiting my Father and my Uncle in Ahwatukee (Phoenix), Arizona.\n\nI decided to pay for lunch today, and was going to purchase a Papa Murphy's Chicago Style, but didn't have the time to go and retrieve the pizza.\n\nSince we were at my Uncle's place in Ahwatukee, I asked him about Rosati's. He stated that he had enjoyed a number of pizzas from your establishment.\n\nSo, I called. It turns out, I was a little early, and would have to wait about 1 hour and 15 minutes to receive the pizza. I knew it was early, and I was able to work with that.\n\nI ordered the Monster pizza in the Jumbo 18\" size.\nAnd I also placed 2 orders of Jalapeno Poppers.\nI was surprised that the total was over $40... but I figured that for a good meal, I would just shut up and enjoy.\n\n11:45 came, and the delivery driver showed up. About 15 minutes late... but ok... no worries...\nI paid cash and gave the driver a tip.\n\nWe went inside and opened up the pizza and poppers. The first thing I noticed was that the entire crust around the pizza was burned. Black. Charcoal.\n\nImmediately, I called the store and spoke with the person whom I placed the order with. I asked him if his pizza's have a habit of having burned crust. He insured me they did have a habit of being burned, and that I would like it. (At the same time, my uncle is telling me that none of his pizzas had been burned.) We get off the phone.\n\nI actually try the pizza crust, and do not like the burned, carbon crust.\n\nI try the other side of the slice, which is in rectangles, not the normal slices, and I am not impressed with that part either.\n\nI try one of the poppers, and it is OK at best.\n\nMy father remarks how the pizza is OK, not good, but OK, and how he does not like the poppers.\n\nMy uncle is picking at his food, and notes that this is not like the other pizzas he has ordered from them.\n\nAgain, I called, again, I spoke with the same person... I informed him that I was NOT happy with the pizza. He stated that he has never had a complaint before. I explain to him how I am not happy with the pizza and then th poppers. I stop a few sentences in and realize that there was total silence on the other end. I had been hung up on.\n\nImmediately I call back again... he answered differently this time. I accused him of hanging up on me. He did not deny it. I told him I was going to leave negative reviews. He told me to go ahead and do so, and that I would not be the first, and I will not be the last... and he hung up on me again.\n\nI don't know the name of the guy. It was the same person every time I called.\n\nI own a business in Colorado Springs, and I understand customer service exceedingly well. In fact, my business is listed as Best of the Springs.\n\nSo, when someone hangs up on me, not once, but twice, I would like to know what the management is going to do.\n\nI am actively seeking a resolution to this.\n\nPLEASE CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS\nGreg Swartz\n719-648-9170
2 ||| We ordered a pizza for take out on a Sunday night.  They said it would be ready in fifteen minutes and when I got there it was already done.  The pizza was OK and definitely better than Domino's, even with their new spiffy recipe.  \n\nWe got the veggie pizza, which sounded better than what we actually got.  The end product looked great, but I think maybe there are too many toppings for the crust to hold.  The crust ended up a little soggy, especially towards the center, and the sauce seemed to have been absorbed by the toppings save around the outside of the pizza.  Despite this, the pizza was edible and I'll probably order from them again at some point.  Instead of getting their veggie pizza, I'll probably pick my own toppings and simplify things a little.  Hopefully that will solve the soggy-no-sauciness problem.
4 ||| You get a lot of food - for a very good price.  Meal starts of with giant steaming mini cornbreads.  Order an entree and get choice of two sides (mac and cheese, potatoes, fries etc).  \n\nFried chicken was great.  Sides were somewhat disappointing.  Cornbread was amazing!
2 ||| Maybe I came on an off day, but I've been here for 40 minutes without my food. When my spaghetti arrives, it tastes good -but not worth the extremely long wait. The food tasted fine for the price but the wait is what killed it. Felt a little ignored as far as service went even though only two other couples were in the store and they only had 1 call in order.
1 ||| Ridiculously expensive and I feel like I was ripped off.  I was charged close to $100 to diagnose my  vehicle. Additionally, I was given an estimate of $700 to fix the vehicle with statements implying it could be much, much higher depending on the extent of the repairs. I really wish I had known they were going to charge me so much just to hook a computer up to it and diagnose it.  I would have found another repair shop, and could easily have found one that would do a free, if not much lower cost diagnosis. \n\nTook my vehicle to Josh at Family Auto, on Arizona in Chandler, who fixed it for under half the cost of Greulich\"s estimate. He was also appalled that they charged so much just to diagnose the vehicle.
4 ||| I love family owned establishments. I just ate here for the first time. It was great!! By far the best Mediterranean food I've had in Phoenix. The quality of the service and food was excellent. The food was presented well, very tasty and enough portion size to leave me walking away stuffed. \n\nI was joined by my wife Carol, my 22 year old grandson Michael and our friend Kathy R.\n\nKathy R. had eaten here before. In fact she has been coming here for years. She said at one time or another she has tried everything on the menu and just loves their food. Today she ordered the Moussaka. Which she aid was toasty, & creamy.\n (Basically Moussaka is a lasagna without the noodles, the eggplant in it  adds the right amount of bitterness to balance out the great, intense flavor of the sauce.)Although I didn't try a bite it looked great. \n\nMichael got cheese raviolis and an antipasto salad. He didn't say much about either dish but they looked good to me. \n\nMy wife & I got the Pork Souvlaki (Tender chunks of pork served over rice). My wife ate her plate clean which she rarely does so I know she liked her meal. She told me when we got home she wants to go back there so that told me she really enjoyed the food.\n\nLike I said for my dinner entr\u00e9e I ordered the Pork Souvlaki . But before I did I  ordered a Greek Salad as a starter. It was much bigger than I expected for a side salad. The salad was very fresh. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were extremely tasty. I didn't know my entr\u00e9e came with either a Greek salad or  Agolemono soup. Since I had already ordered and eaten a Greek salad I opted  for the Augolemono Soup (chicken stock, egg lemon soup) my soup was absolutely  outstanding!!!! All meals  also come with a vegetable of  the day and homemade pita bread. You could tell the pita bread was homemade. It tasted fresh and came out hot. OMG it was delicious.\n\nI almost forgot with dinner Kathy R. wanted us to try the spaghetti with meat sauce so we could see what it was like. It was a small side dish. Kathy raved about it so I thought why not try it. My wife said she liked it and would order it. I thought it was just OK then again I grew up in Rhode Island in a very Italian neighborhood so it may have been good for a Greek restaurant but not to my taste. Back in Rhode Island the Italians and Greeks cooked many similar dishes including pasta dishes.\n\nFOOD: All of the food was great. The food was so good! I would definitely come back for more in the future.PRICE: . SERVICE:   \"staff\" consisted of  a mother-\nsister-brother team.  The mom wasn't there today. The brother sat us and brought us menus. He was very friendly. The sister was our waitress and server, she was attentive and friendly.  AMBIANCE:  A cute little family owned restaurant tucked in a small strip mall. The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely. It does look like it has been there for many years but the place is NOT as Nadia C, said \"Dumpy\". \nCONCLUSION:  We were seated immediately. Food was excellent, service was spot-on. My recommendation: if you want authentic, come here for an outstanding dining experience!!! This is a very special neighborhood ethnic restaurant.TURN FACTOR: 100%
4 ||| Cowabunga Dudes:\n\nThis palce Rocks. Best spicy bloody mary I have ever had (and I've had a few). My favoriite memory of this bar is when a fight broke out at the pool table, and the Robin (the bar maid) jumpped over the bar and beat both of the offenders. Ejecting them both from the Bah.  The wangs are not half bad too, $0.25 on Mondays, and Jude has very visualy pleasant set of breasts. Her sister's kinda cute too, not quite the boobies but curvey. WARNING: Watch out for for Mansuray she lurks on the corner stool, and will try to spice your beer. This is all true pilgrim, amen.
0 ||| crappy food and crappy service
0 ||| Disgusting!!!!! i saw one people at the front door who seat guests blow his nose into the corner of the resturant onto the floor while he thought nowone was looking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nwe got up and left.
1 ||| Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Back when it first opened Arizona Mills was fun and exciting. Not to be cliche, but for it's first year or so it really was the talk of the town when it comes to shopping malls. It was a place you could go to find great deals and stores that weren't at any other local malls. Something about the place was just fun. \n\nFast forward about ten years... oh lordy, what happened?! Slowly but surely this mall has taken a nose dive. To put it bluntly, this mall has transformed into nothing more than a gang hang out. Almost all of the stores that made this place interesting at one point in time have closed and been replaced with an alarming number of urban clothing stores. The few decent stores that are left seem to be closing or on their way out in some way... it all just has this very 'bargain bin' type of feel now. \n\nThis place is officially in the process of biting the dust in my opinion. Even if they open up new stores or try to revitalize it, it's just not fun going to a mall where you barely even feel safe. Sad to say... but you've lost your edge AZ Mills. 2/5.
0 ||| unlike Amy D. I have not had every carrier you can think of, ONLY Cricket, and now, a two year binding indentured servant contract thru TMobile.\nLet's start off with the store: was it built on top of an indian burial ground? is there a sewer main that has broken? Is their septic tank backed up? do their employees shower in sulfur springs?\nwhat is up with that stank in this place!? I've been here twice now and each time it reeked of rotten eggs. It was so bad that the first time I came here, my friends waited for me outside!\nT-Mobile for me, is synonomous with shoddy service, I can never get a signal! Whether it's in my own bathroom, the 4th floor of the office building I work in, or sitting in class. \nMy calls are constantly dropped as well. I will be mid sentence before I realize there isnt anyone on the other end and I've been talking to dead air. \nPrittaay. Prittaay. Frustrating.\n[rickety] Cricket gets a lot of [roberta] Flak for their ghetto-ish-ness (see what I did there?) but I will take them anyday, I remember the good ol' days when I'd ride my bike down to mill and sit at the Cricket store amongst the other lost souls, as I waited to pay my $40 bill, It was a hairs breadth away from waiting in line at DES or the DMV, crying babies, rapidly spoken spanish chattering from all corners, an apathetic and overweight security guard by the door, dirty chairs, stained carpet, a snoozy black dude falling asleep next to me practically on my shoulder Ahhh the good ol days of Cricket.\nnot anymore\nNow T-mobile and the unintelligible phillipine call centers rule my cell phone usage, with their expensive payments, my crappy phone, their shoddy service, it's enough to push a man into becoming like Michael Douglas's character in \"Falling Down\"\n... and to add insult to injury they dont even have Catherine Zeta-Jones as their spokeswoman anymore: ummm WTF just because she was in Entrapment? c'mon it wasnt Sean Connery's best but it wasnt her worst! dont hold Entrapment against her! bring back Catherine ZJ you morose motherfuckers!\ncannot wait 'till that 2 year contract is up!
3 ||| After i walked past the homeless guy sitting outside the door eating chicken and entered This KFC i noticed it was Really small but neat and up to date. The service was prompt and the food came on time. Our server was nice, Really nice i almost wanted to leave him a tip. In the middle of my meal another homeless guy walked in and his trash bag full of his stuff ripped open and spilled all over the floor,  The nice server grabbed a mop and cleaned up whatever had spilled. Besides that it was a good experience at KFC
3 ||| We used this company twice on our recent trip to Las Vegas to get married.  Our flight was delayed by the driver kept close attention to the flight status and was exactly where he was reported to be in our reservation.  On our way to the marriage bureau we asked for a Post Office in order to drop off our Elopement announcements - he knew exactly where to stop at one on the way to our final destination.\n\nOn our wedding day we reserved an Escalade from our hotel, to the chapel and then a tour of Hoover Dam.  The driver was very helpful and friendly.\n\nUsing this company made our weekend a success and we recommend them to anyone heading to Vegas.  The have a large fleet of various cars, limos and SUVs and the price is on target for the service.
0 ||| My husband and I ordered pizza and garlic knots togo last night and were completely underwhelmmed with the quality of both. Nothing about either item seemed fresh or homemade. The garlic knots were very close to being burnt on top, but were raw in the middle.. which likely means they were FROZEN and placed in the oven to bake.. We attempted to finish cooking them ourselves, but in the end we just threw them away. The pizza crust was flavorless and seemed generic.. reminded me of school pizza but with better toppings. The prices for this place match local pizzerias such as mellow mushroom, fuel and tony's in Ballantyne - however the quality and flavor does NOT.  I felt like I completely wasted my money.
1 ||| Disappointing.  We decided to drive across town and try it based on the Yelp reviews and it was definitely a letdown.  Not horrible but not particularly good either.\n\nOn a Friday night at 7:30, it was less than half full. The people at the door were not particularly friendly but little did we know that it would go downhill from there.  Our waitress was one of the most surly servers I've ever had anywhere.  No greeting, no smile, no eye contact.  Just a look of pained exasperation.  We asked her a few questions and she simply ignored them.  It was not busy.  Seriously, the unfriendliness of the staff here is hard to overstate.  They just don't give a damn.\n\nThe food was all over the place.\n\nSalsas - excellent, both red and green. Nice and spicy just like we like it.\n\nChips - fresh, but greasy.\n\nChicken enchiladas in mole sauce - quite good. Humongous portion.\n\nSteak Tampiquena  - just ok.  Not really a traditional Tampiquena.   About four ounces (or less) of pounded round steak with no topping of any kind.  Not bad but a bit pricey for the eleven bucks or so they are asking and not up to the standard that you get at most Mexican joints around town.\n\nBeans - Awesome, as many reviewers point out.  Some of the best refried beans I've ever had. By far the highlight of the meal.\n\nGuacamole -  Overwhelmed by the flavor of what I can only guess to be powdered citric acid instead of fresh lime juice.  Very odd and not really nice at all.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't use fresh limes?  \n\nMariachis - insistent and annoying.  And a bit much for a place like this really.\n\n$35 with two cheap drinks and a totally unwarranted tip.
1 ||| I wish I could give Cox zero stars but Yelp won't allow it.\n\nI recently upgraded to their new Contour HD DVR box.  I had been a Cox customer for almost 2 years,,,after calling for technical problems too long to list here, almost every night during the first two weeks after \"upgrading\" to their new Contour box I switched to Direct Tv and am in couch potato heaven ever since.\n\nAfter telling Cox I would rather have kept my old box because the new Contour was a joke with all the technical problems, they offered me yet another lame apology...I told them it was time for them to take some $$ off my bill of over $180 / month and after a 20 minute hold they came back to tell me they were refunding me $9.80 for my troubles...how generous!\n\nTrying to keep this as short as possible, but i could list 20 things better with Direct TV..especially the On Demand features.  Besides the programming which is 1000 times better with Dir TV,  there is no lag when rewinding and FF like with Cox, and I don't have to unplug my box 3 times a day to reboot it anymore because the screen freezes every two hours.\n \nCox also tried to tell me if I switched to Dir TV I would not get local channels and would still need them for these channels...this is NOT TRUE!!!  Dir TV gets all local channels!\n\nAlso no cords or additional boxes for additional rooms.,,,I could go on and on.\n\nThe remote is half the size too!\n\nWith direct TV every single channel is in HD with no limited duplicate channels for HD.  Unlike with Cox you can record the free programs you order on demand and almost every channel you get is also available in On Demand.  Unlike Cox, my HBO and Showtime On Demand w Dir TV have every single movie they are showing and every full season of every series that has ever been shown on them, including mini series like The Pacific and Band of Brothers...every episode of every season of Sopranos, Curb, Eastbound and Down, The Wire, the Comeback, Extras,,,everything!  Cox would show 2 seasons max of Sopranos and half the total series...none of the old ones that aren't on anymore for sure.\n\nThe Dir TV sports pack makes the MLB, NBA and NHL packages uneccessary purchases (though still available for purchase) as you get Comcast and Fox sports channels from all over the country that Cox does not because Comcast is their cable competitor. If you live in Vegas with Cox MLB Extra Innings package you cant watch any Bay Area teams games as they are blacked out.  Dir TV with Comcast Bay Area gets all these games, plus all San Diego and AZ games (Cox gets a limited amount of SD/AZ games on ch 96, but never both on the same night and most of the time neither, even when guide says it's on).  I now get more games w out the MLB package on Dir TV than I got with it on Cox!\n\nNot to mention you can only get NFL package w Direct TV and it's free the first year!\n\nAlso I switched to Century Link for internet for $30 a month...Cox was charging me $60 plus $15 for a home phone i don't use but needed for internet with them,,,no home phone needed w Century Link.  Also my cox modem had no WiFi at that ridiculous price, while my tiny Cent Link box is a modem and Wifi router all in one piece of hardware (you need a separate router w Cox for WiFi).\n\nI had Direct TV 8 years ago and it has improved leaps and bounds since then.,,the picture is even better and most On Demand movies are in 1080 definition.\n\nGet Direct TV, you will love it...Cox is the worst across the board!!!\n\nAS
2 ||| Went here with a large group for a holiday lunch.\n\nIt was... just okay. We pick a different restaurant every year, and we've yet to hit a jackpot. But, hey, free lunch.\n\nThe server was really nice but made some noob mistakes like not writing down the table positions of who ordered what. What ensued was a bunch of people circling the table for 10 minutes going, \"Turkey club? Turkey club?\" No one ever did own up to that turkey club. I got the fish and chips which were Long John Silver-esque. Definitely not impressed.\n\nTheir beers are okay but I didn't order any on this particular trip. Maybe the food is more impressive after a few Kiltlifters?
2 ||| Very busy location, but I never feel like I'm in line very long. There are a few downsides, such as parking. Good luck tryin to find parking during their lunch and dinner rushes! The tables and floors could also be cleaner. There is always food on the ground and crumbs on the tables.
4 ||| I read a Yelp talk thread that was singing the praises of Niccoli's Deli & Pizza a couple of months ago. So I decided to take the plunge after my office moved to CenPho.\n\nThis is a Mom & Pop place that's been around for over thirty years. I talked to the Mrs. for a couple of minutes explaining that I was the new kid in town. She explained the setup where you order and they call you if it's busy but will bring your meal to the table if they're not swamped with customers.\n\nThey don't have a soda machine. They sell individual cans. I ordered the meatball sub sandwich. The bread was really soft. They cut up the meat so you don't have your meatballs falling out of the bread like most meatball sandwiches. They have a lot of marinara sauce on the sandwich and it is piping hot. The ladies out there can probably only eat half of the sandwich, that's how big it is. I would say that it had to be one of the tastiest meatball sandwiches I have ever had.\n\nI definitely will be a regular customer of Niccoli's.
1 ||| It's a flea market.  Nothing more; nothing less.  It's old crap that no one should need unless you are a hoarder.  There are plenty of free flea markets and yard sales that are free.  This misadventure cost me $20 in admission fees.  What a waste.  It's $10 a head.  Finally, no one takes credit cards... even for the admission charge.  After all, flea markets and yard sales typically deal in cash only.  I now feel slightly dirty.
4 ||| This is a good place, It has been here for about 20 years now. Of course over the years we have gone here many times. It is always nice. I stopped in for a to go order on this occasion.  I called from the parking lot at work and then by the time i got there it was almost ready to go.  It is always very good and it smelled wonderful when i arrived. It can be a bit expensive but, it is good food. The salads are wonderful!  Plenty of Parking it is at the Biltmore.
4 ||| I took my husband here as a surprise.  He wanted to be a fighter pilot when he was growing up, but thanks to horrible astigmatism, that dream was dashed!  \n\nThe museum is really a hanger, which is cool because it ties everything together.  The downside though was that it was really warm.  \n\nThere were people at certain exhibits that were able to answer any questions you had about certain gadgets and planes.  One was a bit crabby and had this \"I'm better than you\" vibe to him though.  The other that we spoke to was very polite and funny.\n\nThis isn't an all day museum, which is unfortunate with how much it costs!
4 ||| YES! Grab your nom nom face and head on over! \nExperience: I looked this place up on yelp since I knew I'd be in the area. My wife and I went in and the place was packed, no tables. We were ordering and one opened up, my wife quickly snagged it and after I sat down the guy came over and wiped it down for us. \nFood: Food took a little bit to be done but they were crazy busy, in store and phone orders. The food was amazing! I got steak shawarma and my wife got a fish wrap and baklava. I cannot wait to go back, I neeeed it.\nFor the record, I'd had gyros/wraps before.. first time with shawarma. I asked the guy taking orders what he recommended and went along with it. I want to explore the whole menu.
1 ||| I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back.
3 ||| The service is ok at best.  Given it's usually a handful of high school kids who work there I tend to be a little more forgiving, but clearly whoever is managing this location and training these kids doesn't have a clue. In fact I've seen the who appears to be the manager be part of the problem...  On at least 5 occasions in the last 2 months I've been at the drive thru waiting for my coffee while it appears to be social hour inside... including the women who seems to be in charge.\n\nLast night I ordered 2 sundaes.  They were made and sat at the window for at least 5 minutes while they prepared something for the car in front of me.  When I got to the window I asked why they wouldn't have had the car pull around so my ice cream didn't melt.. that was met with \"oh, ya we should have done that.\"  No offer to remake my sundaes.\n\nThe original owner/manager had this place running like a top!  Where did he go?
0 ||| STAY AWAY!!! The food was AWFUL, and the service was weird. allow me to elaborate.\nfood- i got the california omelet with an english muffin. english muffin literally burned to a crisp, omelet OVERFLOWING with spinach that was most likely previously frozen. BF got chicken and waffles. chicken so greasy you could strap them to your feet and use them like ice skates on the tile floor, waffles crunchy like a potato chip. \nService- wheres the fire? waiters and waitresses literally RUNNING around everywhere except to their tables. at one point a salty old broad threw down the silverware she was holding and shouted the f word and ran to the back. other waiters and waitresses snapping at one another, super awkward. \nwe eventually had to demand our check and ran out as quickly as possible. be warned, the room service food comes from the same place. ew.
1 ||| Horrible Customer Service! The salesman that we had is so dull and boring! We bought love seat and he wasn't happy with our decision with picking our furniture. Duh! we live less than 2 mile from this RC Willey. I guess he wants to make more commission from us! Too bad, we are too cheap!
4 ||| The lobby area is gorgeous, and it always smelled good when we walked thru (not sure if someone was always lurking that smelled good or what, because it never seemed to be the same smell, but I always took notice of it smelling good).\n\nAfter we checked in and got up to our room, we weren't up there long and we got a phone call -- from the front desk, asking to make sure everything was good with our room. That was nice. We've never had that with any other hotel before.\n\nStayed in a king room with bunk beds. The kids got a kick out of the bunk beds, but all it is in a metal bunk bed set in an area that is partitioned off from the rest of the room. The king bed was pretty comfy.\n\nThe room was clean and just enough for us.\n\nThe pool area was fun and even my 12 year old, and almost-10-year-old enjoyed themselves. Most times they played basketball in the pool, but they also went down the slide quite a few times. There's a water area which is good for smaller kids too.\n\nTo really call this a \"water park\" is kind of silly. Because it's really just sort of a water area. I knew from reading reviews and doing research ahead of time that it wasn't going to be a big thing -- so there was no disappointment. But for someone that might not look that closely and just sees \"water park\" might be quite shocked when they arrive.\n\nWe had a good time, and the stay was good. We'd definitely consider staying here in the future.
1 ||| Only one star because 0 stars isn't an option   I arrived late due to nightmare traffic on I-15 and nearly everything was closed. Despite my deeply held loathing for Papa John's (issues with them honoring their own coupons) I called them anyway to order two cheese pizzas for pickup. I was informed that I could wait 90 minutes for delivery but couldn't drive there and pick them up. Huh?  I was told its a safety issue. But it's perfectly safe to send drivers out at night?  Morons. They just confirmed everything I hate about Papa John's.  I've never wanted to see a company go out of business so badly as I do Papa John's.
1 ||| Usually this is a good location. I actually drive out of my way past another wendys to get to this one. My chili was not hot nor was the container filled. My nuggets were old and stale. Very disappointed after this visit.
2 ||| i first checked out the website before going here, and the website gave me the impression this place was something waayy different from what it actually is. Total let down, i was expecting to ride some good rides, when actually this place is for kids.. i mean little kids. Only two rides you can consider adult friendly, and still were not all that impressive. the one big roller coaster is alright, but really short and the \"Flyer' is probably their best attraction. Would i go back?? prob not unless i took kids..if you have kids they would love it though.
4 ||| Thank you Sonora Quest for  having online scheduling. I had to get blood drawn the other day and I went online and made a 2:30 appointment. I showed up at 2:25, and at 2:30 they called me back and drew my blood. I was in and out in about 10 minutes. \n\nIn previous years I have waited up to an hour, because you just had to stand in line and wait.  This new process is fantastic!
4 ||| Really nice zoo! If you go via I-10 to the 303, you also get to gawk at the old Phoenix Trotting Park, which is a bonus.\n\nQuick Tip: Park and enter through the East Entrance, which is near the aquarium. If you stay past the zoo's closing time (the aquarium is open much later), you'll want your car near the entrance that's still open.\n\nIt's admittedly a tad unimpressive if you enter through the West entrance. It appears that most of their older exhibits are there, many of them simply a fenced in dirt-and-grass area with a shabby wood shelter. There is also a sad little carousel that looks right out of a defunct North Korean amusement park.\n\nThe selection of animals here is really phenomenal; I don't know the exact numbers, but they have a sign up claiming to be in the top 30 zoos in the country in animal diversity. Some highlights are the immense bird collection, the Reptile House, the Baby Animal Nursery (Come on--is there anything cuter than a baby ocelot contemplating scratching your face off?), and of course, the Aquarium. They've done a great job on this new section of the zoo, and it looks like they have even more planned. The hands-on stingray exhibit was a hit with the kiddo.\n\nThere are a lot of \"extras\" that cost additional cash as people have mentioned in past reviews. We did the sky ride and the train ride, which were worth the few bucks they cost. The food at the little cafes is typically overpriced for any zoo. One difference between this and the Phoenix Zoo is that there is also a really \"nice\" restaurant on the property, the Tiburon. We didn't try it, but it looked like a great menu and a nice diversion even if you're not going to the zoo.\n\nOverall a really nice place. The staff is exceptionally friendly. It's a bit pricey, but it's a must-see for any animal lovers. Plus, it's the only aquarium in the state. If you've been conned into one of those Entertainment Guides, there is a buy one-get one coupon for admission.
0 ||| Terrible haircut. She took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. I then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. Now I have to go back to get it fixed. I would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again.
2 ||| I have arrived in the location after a long day of doing Search and rescue in Breezy Point.  I was greeted horribly by the guy who work there.  \n\nLack of communication to the management\nDoes not know how to talk to people
3 ||| I can't comment on lodging or food because all I did there was gamble....race and sports book is very nice...almost exactly like GVR....tellers were for the most part nice....got 2 drink coupons for betting $50 on sports....won some on poker machine and betting sports...just off 15 on NW side of town about 15 min from downtown..easy to get in and out
4 ||| Kmart is the \"also-ran\" of big box stores. I don't know any that have a large grocery section but they do have a decent selection of general merchandise, clothing, personal care, toys, and housewares. I needed to get a plant as a last minute gift for a friend (never show up empty handed!). I had been planning to hit the home and garden department at the store further back in the mall, but gave the Big K a chance. Good move - they had exactly what I needed and at the right price. This makes Bruce a happy shopper!
2 ||| I have been here twice now. First time I would give 4 stars. I had a pasta special and tried some of my friend's spinach, bacon and olive oil pizza. Service was great, ambiance was cool and food was very good.\n\nThe second time is tough. I'd give the food (pepperoni and sausage pizza) 4.5 and the service a 1 or 0. We arrived last Friday night at 9:15-9:30pm. My boyfriend and I were seated right away and given menus. We said we needed a minute to decide on our drinks. After 15 mins of looking around for our waiter, I finally went to the bar to order drinks and say we couldn't find our waiter. The bartender apolgized and brought our drinks. The waiter came back shortly and asked if we were ready. We ordered garlic bread and the pizza. The garlic bread never came and we thought it may come with the pizza. Finally the pizza came (which was delicious) and our drinks were empty. He never brought the garlic bread or apologized. At that point I didn't care. He took my credit card and came back with the check and didn't run the card. I had to remind him I gave him my card. He may have been really tired or just not \"completely there\". Anyway, I'd come back to give the place another chance because the food is good and I saw a few other servers giving other tables good service while we were there.
0 ||| Absolutely horrible place! Snakes was treated like pieces of shit, and we WILL NOT stand for it! The manager is a complete asshole and doesnt give a shit if you have a good time or not, as long as he gets his money. Completely unprofessional and neither myself, or any of my friends will ever set foot in this hell hole of a place ever again.
2 ||| Half the staff is snotty, but the music is sometimes good, as are about half the baked goods and the spanish lattes and white mochas. Icky sandwiches, sadly. Pick off most of the veggies to make them passable. The black and white cookies, however, are a good, cake-like bet.
3 ||| Cashed in a Groupon at John Mull's last week that ultimately aided in having a epic barbeque this weekend poolside.  I would have to say that their Top Sirloin Steak was one of the best Sirloins I've ever had!  \n\nThere location was a little strange, tucked back in a ranching residential area.  But, it was worth the drive across town!  \n\nI'll be back when they open up the barbeque shack.  By the way, they should have had the barbeque restaurant open  before they ran the Groupon Promotion.  They would have generated a lot of revenue.
4 ||| I stopped at this location because of a driver's side wiper blade that was not making contact in my line of sight across the windshield (had on for less than one month). Joe exceeded my expectations when he took a look at the wiper blade and tested different brands to help fix the issue. I will definitely return to this location for the friendly service and attention to customer needs.
2 ||| HATE  Nothing.\n\nDISLIKE  Did not get checked on as soon as my entree arrived. One of the male employees (possibly the owner) watched the restaurant's TV and changed channels as if he were at home. Too much fat on my kalbi.\n\nLIKE  The boiled peanuts while you waited for your order.  The pleasant female server.\n\nLOVE  The side dishes that came with your order (kim chee, bean sprouts, etc.). The meat jun. Brown rice as an option. Eggs were done just the way I liked them.
4 ||| I went to get a appraisal. They asked if I had a appt. but I didnt. I am from out of state. Brett came out from the back and offered to help. That was very nice of him. I would call ahead and make a appt. before you go in. Thanks Brett for your help. Will for sure be back.
3 ||| this place is our usual go-to steak joint when we just casually want steak. nothing too fancy and reasonably prices. I like their camp side feast where you get to share an appetizer, get two steak dinners, and can share a dessert. I like to get the sampler appetizer because you get the most bang for your buck and comes with like 4 different things. I got the filet mignon medium rare with bleu cheese and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. for dessert I got the cowboy cookie with vanilla ice cream. the service is always good. food is pretty good. can't complain.
4 ||| I do not know why this place has such a low rating. I love this place, the food is great the portions are more than generous, they use white meat chicken, and the service is attentive. Also, the prices are very cheap, $5.50 and $6.50 for lunch is perfectly acceptable. They will change the heat level for any dish and make special arrangements for you. I wanted honey walnut shrimp with chicken instead of shrimp and they did not bat an eyelash they just said no problem. I also like that the plain lo-mein is truly plain, no vegetables or anything. Really give this place a try, and for other posters who have not been here in a while, you may reconsider coming back to this place. The decor is a little odd, 50's Chinese diner chic? Kind of strange but who cares? The place is good, clean, cheap, and the service is good. What more could you want?
3 ||| I've been to girasole many times and have loved the food. The reason for the low marking is because of the service the last time I visited.\n\nIt was over the holidays and my family was in town. Since we were a party of 5 I called the day before to make reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday. We got to the restaurant prior to our reservation time and they said it would be half an hour. We are easy goin people so we didn't mid waiting.\nThe owner instructed us to go to the bar next door and have a drink. After 45 min I went back to the restaurant since they hadn't called us yet and he instructed us to go back to the bar.\nFinally after waiting an hour and a half they finally sat us. This bothered me for two reasons. 1. The people who got say before us did not have reservations, walked in after us, but knew the owner. Very poor form on the owners part. 2. He said we would \"be taken care of\". I was thinking maybe an appetizer or wine, something for promising us a table with reservations and then having us wait for over an hour. But when the bill came there was none of that.\nWe still had a good time since the company was good but it will be a long time before I go back to this restaurant.
0 ||| In lieu of the recent events that provide a haunting admonition to the fate of Larry and Carol's, I'd like to add my review.\n\nHere's to the late nights on Semple street, having too good of a time to stumble the fifteen feet across the street to our door; here's to the muscle outside Larry and Carol's until 4 AM, the muscle that came back a few hours later, the muscle that kept a pretty dirty watch on the block. Here's to the always-tired staff, the cooks that wouldn't hesitate to ask you what the hell you wanted in their store, the cooks that gave up dough for the locals. Here's to the pizza, that horrible pizza; and here's to the rest of the food that we were too wasted to ever want to try, because it was always about the pizza. Here's to the King Kong, and here's to the parties, and here's to the memories of Larry and Carol's.\n\nThey weren't the best place, they weren't the nicest place, but they were quite the place.\n\nL&C, L&C, L&C forever.
4 ||| Probably best cafe in champaign. I'm from Chicago and this cafe can compare to some of the best cafes in Chicago.
4 ||| Damn this place is yummy.  I just moved to Glendale and was happy to see there's a location over there.  So I will be going there a lot.\n\nI've been tot his location twice with some friends and the service is incredible.  My girlfriend was a little hungover from the night before of a little partying and banana's are a great medicine for a hang over.  I called up Good Egg before we showed up to ask if they had fresh ones.. they did!!  We show up and I go in and they happily hand me one.  Aweee.. how awesome.\n\nIf you order their pancakes, keep in mind the size of these monsters.  You can get one, two or three.  Our friend's son can polish off the three stack like it's nothing.  I did two and barely finished it.  The food is delicious and the variety is huge. Omelets, pancakes, eggs, etc. \n\nThis place is great.
4 ||| Well this is the definitely the \"hood\" Walmart in this area. I have visited this locale plenty of times....it's dirty......unorganized....and has an awful smell. However this particular Walmart has a vast inventory of merchandise that other Walmart's in the valley don't. I have always been able to find whatever I needed at this location....when I couldn't find it anywhere else....and that includes the one within walking distance of my apartment. This locale is always busy just like most Walmart stores in this area.....they just need to clean it up....and organize it....and it could be an even better  Walmart. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
3 ||| If your kid is under school age it is a good museum. It's a little boring for those over 6. For the size of Madison having a childrens museum at all is an accomplishment.
3 ||| I've tried to like this place because I live close.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is extremely courteous.  But... I've tried numerous pasta dishes and found them all lacking.  The red sauce is too sweet, the Alfredo is bland, and the \"pink\" sauce tastes  somewhat like spicy nacho cheese.  Which might be ok on tortilla chips, but not butternut squash ravioli.  My advice: stick with the pizza muffins.  They're great!
0 ||| Went to the nini nails on John Delany and got the worst pedicure ever staff was rude and my nails look like crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4 ||| If you stay at the Hilton garden inn, you get a free appetizer with your room card. I ordered the onion loaf, which is essentially onion rings molded into a circular wall and  looks like a nest. Pretty neat concept, except I've had better deep fried onions.\n\nTheir medallion steak filets were really really great and perfectly cooked. It also came with a half rack of ribs, which were well cooked, but their original BBQ sauce was the worst I've had. I had to switch out for the honey BBQ sauce instead.\n\nOverall, it was a great meal, but you can also find good steaks elsewhere with better ribs. Also, the only other people there were old people.
2 ||| A cautious 3.5 stars here but....\n\nS-W-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-P!\n\nThe Bucs swept the Royals in interleague play this past weekend!  And okay, I was there for the second game, not the third.  But I took my dad to the game for an early Father's Day gift.  We had a wonderful time as the Pirates defeated the Royals 5-3.  And I'm watching the Pirates with guarded optimism here.  They're off to the same great start they were last year. An article in the paper said that they were playing small ball, which must eman they're working on the little things, the fundamentals.  \n\nNow let's see if we can keep the momentum going for the rest of the season and finish with at least a winning record for a chiange.  Oh well, at least with the Chicago Cubs sucking so badly we won't be in the cellar.
4 ||| Although this place carries some of the highest end kitchen and professional cooking utensils,  they still make you feel like your right at home.  The staff are very friendly and personable,  not conceded at all.  I went in to get some knives sharpened,  and  was treated to a Nespresso demo with complimentary espresso while I waited. The staff was very knowledgeable about all products  that I asked about,  especially their high end knives.   I'm definitely going back next time I need anything kitcheny!
4 ||| Love their orangeade- so fresh and flavorful. We really wanted to try their famous sunday brunch buffet this time. Food was really good, not the best, but good quality, well stocked and clean buffet tables. There was A LOT to choose from- honorable mentions are mediterranean salad, biscuits (perfect texture and not overly salty!), broccoli casserole (yum!), fresh fruits and carrot cake. Kind of wish if they had an omelette station too ;-)
1 ||| Not what i expect from New York unless you count the attitudes... Pizzas arent bad but not great either. Sauce tastes like its right out of the can and the pizza i last got seemed a bit old.  Dough tasted a bit like cardboard and looked like it was either left in the box way to long or was reheated. Not the first time i have gotten a pizza from here and was hoping for a better second and third attempt but it never happened. I will be looking else where unless they decide to change a few things.
3 ||| This was my first visit to Paddy Cake.  I had to pick up a little something for this diabetes support group I belong two.  Yes, I am aware of the irony folks.  Just remember this, diabetics can have cakes and sweets in moderation!  And my little group has evolved into an excuse to get together and play cards or board games!  Anyway, I picked up a small coffee cake for the occasion.\n\nThis place is a treat just to walk into.  It's got everything a traditional bakery should have and is very inviting.  I read a few bad reviews on Google about their customer service.  I don't see why--their service seemed fine to me.  I haven't actually tasted the cake yet, so I can't comment on it.
2 ||| One of my 1st stops I hit when I want to know what's going on in Mad City.  Good guides, poking fun and interesting stories.  I really wish they'd lighten up a bit more.\n\n...or maybe I just wish it was a little more like the Village Voice.\n\n\nEither way it's good for the locals here.
2 ||| I have been ordering from here for awhile.. I dont really like it and there are better options for chinese fast food. But they are fast and cheap which is why i usually order from them. \nSome of the dishes are really good. While most of the dishes seem like a very cheap ripoff of what they should be.  All the sauces taste like they came right out of a container, and for some reason they bread everything! Even the sesame chicken.\n\nI will order from here again but i will stick with the lo mein.
0 ||| I don't know how this place is in business. Fried rice tasted fishy and the pork was totally dried out. Sweet sour chicken had no vegetables. My understanding is that this dish has peppers, pineapple, etc.  Crystal shrimp was shrimp tossed in an over abundance of clumpy mayo with a few plain untoasted walnuts on top. Worst Chinese food ever, in a dark corner of a bad neighborhood and the restaurant is not fixed up nice at all. Stay away.
2 ||| Came here for pizza hut pizza. This taco bell doesn't not sell pizza. Some-how due to not being able to use the bathroom, I decide to order some fast food. I order the nachos grande or whatever you call it. Boy I haven't being here in years and I guessed it showed. These nachos only had cheese, sour cream, chicken, and beans. So I had to add extra toppings. Yelp 20 mins later- taco bell did it's job-I am now sitting on the toilet  writing this review and boy I am happy that I am to use the restroom.
2 ||| Tucked in a corner table in their wine/back house location was cozy given the rain pour happening outside. I ordered a chianti to start and then we ordered the vegetable app dish to share, which were both good. For my main meal I ordered the margherita DOC pizza based on the reviews. Delicious, fresh flavors though my pizza was a bit soggy which was a bit of a downer given the raves. However I would be interested in coming back and making sure that wasn't an anomaly.
4 ||| In my opinion, this place has one of the best pho broths! Their pho is very consistent each time. There's one thing I always must get, their Red Bean Drink. Wow... just try it and you'll want another one.
4 ||| My bf and I came here for the packers game and it was a lot of fun! The place gets super packed and the atmosphere is awesome!! They have a lot of Wisconsin plates, which were super good! You must try the cheese curds and the Wisconsin brats!  Did I mentioned they brew their own beer?? I really like supporting our local brewers, so please come and drink a beer! Their service was really good, even though the bar was very busy our waitress was checking on us on a regular basis! I'm giving them 3 stars mainly due to their nachos and poor tv image. I mean, come on! A great sport bar must have great nachos!!! Their ingredients were very cheap and not very tasty, they need to add more ingredients and maybe some chicken. Also, knowing that this is a green bay packers bar their tvs should have a better image, they do not seem to have HDTV and they had tons of problems with the sound!
4 ||| This 5 star review is very different from most of my others. \nThis is a 5 star perfect run of the mill, ridiculously consistent, super friendly, makes me feel warm inside type of diner. But don't mistake it for anything else, it is a diner. A classic 24 hour, gets eggs & bacon whenever you want type of place.\nService is top notch (especially Sara & Myra) as well as most of the others. Coffee is always fresh and kept warm and full in my cup. Food is more consistent than other other restaurant I have been to in CLT. I know exactly what is getting put in front of me, and for a great price.\nI have learned to order my hash browns well done, because otherwise they are kinda raw in the middle, but they accommodate to any request with a smile. \nDinner plates are all great that I have tried as well, their brown gravy has a hint of cinnamon & nutmeg in it. A bit different, but once I got used to it I loved it! \nI almost feel my wife and I are here \"too often\" but for great price and a wait staff who knows your \"regular\" this is my go to place for eats any time of day.
1 ||| Well.... the reviews are kinda all over the place. I stayed here Friday, October 10, 2014.\n\nfirst off it wasn't worth the 80 something dollars I spent for one night. I certainly wouldn't call it a \"beautiful\" resort either.... and what makes a resort a resort?\nThis place is just what it is.... a motel. \n\nI don't smoke and there is a $300 charge if they catch you smoking in a room but...... people were smoking outside the rooms and the smoky aroma wafted in the night I was there. \n\nThe motel is old point blank. the air vents are full of dust but that happens no biggie. The room was fairly clean and you can tell they are trying to improve the place. It just wasn't worth what I spent. I would rather spend $40 more and spend the night in a nicer more updated place. The lighting is not the best either.\n\nWhat got me riled up was the mold problem in the shower. I do understand that a little mold happens but once the room was all moist the mold really showed up. I have a severe allergy to mold and this wasn't a good thing. \n\nI wouldn't say i would never stay there again but for the price I would pay a little more and stay somewhere more updated.\n\nThis place needs a major inside renovation. remove all the old interior walls and update the materials. there are products that help to eliminate mold issues now days. The outside is nice. but still could use a little more TLC.\n\nThey did have flat screen tv's and working air conditioning.\nThey did not have complimentary breakfast anywhere I could see.\nI could not access any wifi.
3 ||| Store is always clean, sometimes there's free food samples, check-out line goes fast, prices are reasonable for the quality merchandise, good prepared meals/food options.
0 ||| A good friend had a dog that required surgery and the doctors sent the dog home right after the operation. No antibiotics, no how-to-care-for-at-home instructions. The dog was leaking through his stitches and got an infection. She had to take the dog to another vet, plus another huge bill.\nDON'T bother here. My friend's dog almost died and she still has to pay this place.
4 ||| My blackberry wouldn't charge due to a loose mini USB port. I had just 2 bars left for power and it's my only phone so sending it out was not an option. It was out of warranty and I don't carry insurance on my phone. I called Sun Cellar and he quoted me a price and a wait time of 20-25min. I looked around at other repair centers and found their quotes to be 2x as much and they didn't have a tech in until the afternoon and told me it would take an hour or more.\n\nI got there and was helped right away. The repair took 10minutes (if that!). Dan was polite, pleasant, and very knowledgeable. The cost was exactly the price he quoted me on the phone. I am so grateful that he was able to help me out. The repair cost less than my deductible would have cost with insurance, certainly a fraction of what a new phone cost, and he had me operational in 10 minutes! I couldn't ask for better service!\n\nI would certainly recommend this business to anyone needing cell phone repair and will use them again!
0 ||| I absolutely hate this place. Not for the amenities as they are undoubtedly the best in the business, but when you have a problem there is no one to help you. On my last stay I tried for several hours on an off trying to contact someone about the A/C in the room, or just for information about about some of the amenities. No answer. When I did get through to someone I was rudely told that only one person was answering the phones for the entire place. BTW, no one ever showed up to fix the air. \n\nI also have a problem with a place that wants to charge for internet access. Even the mom and pop hotels offer free in-room wifi or wired internet and with what this place charges it should be included. \n\nThe last thing, you get dinged for 18.00 just to park and if you aren't careful they'll double bill you for it if you've prepaid for the room. Parking should also be included in the price of the room and if you want one of those guys at the door to park your car, pay the 25 bucks.
4 ||| Sheraton Crescent gets a 5 star rating. Rooms are clean, breakfast buffet is plentiful and the staff is superb (except for one nasty waitress in the restaurant but everyone is so nice they made up for her).  If you have to stay in North Phoenix the Sheraton is your very best choice. We have tried 4 others in the same price range and they were horrible.  Stay here. It's the very best you're going get.
0 ||| Came here for dinner based on the many positive Yelp reviews and I'm sorry to say this was the worst sushi I have ever had.  The portions were TINY and the sushi was, well, fishy. It didn't taste like the high quality sushi that I was expecting.  Plus the prices were extremely high for the quality and quantity of food received.\n\nI guess RA and Kabuki are the only decent sushi restaurants in the Phoenix metro area.  Avoid this place and go to either of those instead!
0 ||| Can't believe it!  We have eaten here at least twice a month for a few years. ..  Totally happy with our standard breakfast order... We both get huevos rancheros.  Last 2 trips they can't even get the eggs even close.  Over medium means whites cooked and yolks runny.  Egg whites means no yolk!  Both epic fail! When we returned the RAW eggs the chef returned the eggs over hard.  brown and completely over cooked! The term egg whites suddenly is incomprehensible! So we got scrambled eggs.    He sent an obvious screw you because we complained.  They will never see another dime of business from us!
1 ||| Today is Mother's Day and My husband sent me and my mom out for pedi's my usual place was closed so I decided to try them out and why did I do that, 1st we sat down and the massage chairs are worn out arm rest very loose, 2nd the tech sat down and she didnt even speak to my mom she said put your feet up here, so I said hello how are you she looked a smiled I said your suppose to speak to your client, her reply was oh im tired I been working all day, ok and? she still didnt speak anyways they put us in the water to soak the water was sooo hot we could even put i feet in and I like hot water but no scolding hot, so the guy that was going to do my feet sat down and I went to tell him about the bottom of my feet being rough he cut me off and said hold on we will get to that in a moment let me take your polish off, then he said I can use the razor on you, nooooo you wont 1st of all the razor is illegal now in NV and second do you have any callus remover he said yes but it wont remove the callus What? then before he proceeded I said can you make my foot smooth, he said I will make them smooth to me, excuse me then he said Im not your nail tech at the other shop im me, I said I know that anyway to cut the story, WHERE THE HELL IS CUSTOMER SERVICE... AND WHO DID HE THINK HE WAS TALKING TO raising his voice so the manager came back and said no worries I will get someone to do it for you, I waited one lady go done and they spoke in their langauage and she shook her head no. I got up I will go back to my nail spa where you get treated like a queen or king and they have ice cold water waited for you with great massage chairs.... I recommend you not go to this place if you want great service :)
2 ||| I haven't been since they re-did the place, but back in the day, this was one of the places you go to hook up. Everyone is so damn pretty here, lots of greeks here, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Wine night - how I loathe/heart thee.  Who came up with this idea, it's both awesome and awful at the same time.  They always played good music, and I don't know how many times we saw girls jump up on the booths to dance after one too many.  Always a pretty long line to get in.  Cover could be a bit high for a college bar.
3 ||| This is a comic book store.  Great people who are very knowledgeable about past, present, and near future comics.  Always helpful and willing to find what you want.
3 ||| Smaller shop has closed, it had been in business 13 years and has a nice selection of fresh and salt water fish you can not find at the larger pet stores.  They moved down the street.\nThey will match any price of the bigger shops and they offer maintenance.\nThey have parts for your fish tank and can help with advice.\nMoved location - better selection and equipment now.
0 ||| Hair in food. Game over! \nComing from NY, I'm used to amazing chinese food and this place was only okay at first. We've ordered a few times since and its been greasier and greasier. My husband loves chinese food, so he just won't let it go. \nOrdered tonight and there was an obvious short black hair in my general tso's. I'm disgusted and pissed enough to jump online and write them a poor review. Unfortunately, we had only the chicken comped, despite the fact that I wouldn't dare eat anything else we ordered. Never ordering from here again.
3 ||| The ambiance of My Mother's Restaurant is a riot of patterned fabric, antiques, and cheap prints. Chintz! \n\nA generic salad bar is conveniently included with your entree. Nothing fancy, just filling veg and crunchy toppings. The bread that comes with your meal is warm and soft, with a charming taste of being previously frozen, just like mother used to make. (Or my mother, anyway.)\n\nThe entrees are just good plain food. I find them under-seasoned generally, but they are still wholesome and tasty. Get the turkey dinner: thick slices of turkey, with mashed potatoes, delicious green beans, and cornbread stuffing. I tend to snarf half of my turkey plate, and save the rest to make a sandwich the next day, just like Thanksgiving leftovers.
2 ||| The food was decent but a little pricey. We had the az burrito (a little spicy but lots of flavor), carne asada taco (pretty standard), and a fish taco (the texture wasnt what we expected....we prefer the fish tacos you get in rocky point so that might be why). Loved the chips and salsa but wish they were complimentary:) I have a hard time with places that charge for drink refills, so that's a thumbs down. Overall we might go back but this will not be a regular lunch stop for us.
1 ||| I live in Las Vegas and just called the local number here to get more information.\n\nI spoke with JESSICA and I must say she is probably the rudest person that I have ever spoke with.\n\nIf she was like that to me, a new prospect, I can only imagine how they treat their actual customers.\n\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be using their service NOR will I refer anyone to them.
4 ||| Very gourmet sandwhiches. You have to go here to see what the sandwhich of the day is. Excpect to pay about 10$+ for a sandwhich, but it will be good and different from what your normally used to. All fresh ingrediants are used and change from day to day. Its all outdoor seating or take it to go. Dont be surprised if there is a line out of the door. It gets a little crazy at lunch time so go early!
3 ||| Not very many varieties of cupcakes available but the red velvet was very moist
3 ||| This shop has a huge selection of merchandise and the staff was very friendly. My friend and I went there to look for spandex bodysuits. They were they only I've ever visited that would let you try them on. When they didn't have the colors we wanted in stock, they took our numbers and said they'd call when they got them in.
0 ||| the dry cleaning portion of this business is fine the prices are pretty decent to. what you need to watch out for is the alterations part, I just needed my husbands brand new Calvin Klein suit pants tailored. I didn't notice because we picked them up the day of the party but my husband later showed me and it looked horrible like I could have done a better job with my sewing machine. it looked awful and I still want to go back and show them but I don't have anything and it's been a few months. this seamstress couldn't even do a straight line I'm so pissed.
0 ||| Place has bad customer service. I stayed there once and the got my wings wrong 3 times. And last night the same thing happened. Will not be going back anytime soon.
1 ||| This place is actually not good. I went here several times before finally putting my foot down. It is worth a couple extra bucks and walking two blocks to go to Stingray, or really, anywhere else. Like, this place is actually bad, I am unclear on their rating or how they are still in business. I'll give them an extra star for decent service.
4 ||| Awesome turkey cranberry !
4 ||| I was referred to this vet by my fianc\u00e9's coworker. Great place! Very friendly staff, clean and organized. I normally go to ann road animal hospital but that place is always busy, wait times are ridiculous. This place I was only waiting for about 20 min and it was the first time coming here. Prices are reasonable and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone with a pet. I am definitely going to bring the rest of my pets to this vet from now on. Oh did I mention thy are open until 10pm every day? Hours make it very convenient and that's always an added bonus. Very happy!
4 ||| Good quick Chinese food place with healthy options. They do the basic meals as you would expect from a local Chinese restaurant. It doesn't have a nice interior, but it's good enough for a quick lunch or dinner. It's about as good as you can get for takeout Chinese food type places, and the healthy options are really convenient.
1 ||| Overall, Long wait for food, although restaurant was quite empty; flavorless appetizers and entrees; uninterested waiters; unsanitary environment......Went here for dinner with my s.o.  When entering, was quickly greeted  No table was \"ready,\" although there were many empty tables, but the host needed to clean the booth before we could sit.  About 5 minutes later we were seated.  We received bread, but in the middle of preparing the oil for the bread, the host, who ended up being our waiter for part of our meal, stopped and ran to get something for another customer, then returned to finish.  The menu was crusty with old food stains on them.  I tried the Bellini, which was too sweet, my s.o. initially ordered the Mojito, but they were out of mint, so he ordered a cosmo that was not good and most was spilled on the table because the cup was over filled.  Our second drink orders were taken by a different server, Freddie, our appetizer was served by yet another server, and then our meal was served incorrectly by Freddie, that took our order, never wrote it down, and ended up serving me the wrong meal.  When i mentioned this, the server quickly took my plate, and went to grab the correct plate, but did not alert me to the fact that he had not just grabbed the wrong plate, so I had to wait another 10 minutes for my food.  By the time the food came, I was ready to leave, I asked for a to go box and the check as he was placing my plate on the table.  We sampled our meals, and just like the appetizer, salad and pasta before the main dish, all seemed to be very bland, and reminded us of microwave dinners.  We were quite disappointed by the many servers (we still don't know who our waiter was, but did recognize the fact that we only saw them sporadically), we were unhappy with the quality of the food and drinks, and as we left, we both visited the restrooms.  Had I seen the restroom before we sat down for a meal, I would have eaten elsewhere.  EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
2 ||| I thought Village Inns were all nighters like Denny's. \nThis one apparently isn't. Closes by midnight on\nthe weekdays and 2am on weekends. And the late\nnight menu is REALLY stripped down. Pretty much\nall that's left is deep fried bar food appetizer\ntype stuff. The main edible food choices are the\nsandwiches. Lots of parking - part of it belongs\nto the Tutor Time next door though. Of course,\nthat only matters during daytime on the weekdays. \nWe were pretty much the only ones in the place\nbut somehow they still messed up our order. It was\nvery quickly fixed without a fuss so I give our\nwaiter props for that and for having a very good \nsense of humor. Food was just ok. The fried stuff\nwas too greasy for my taste. The sandwich was\npassable. Had one of their limeades. Blech. I've\nhad cough syrup that tasted better. I Will avoid\nthat stuff completely from now on. One of the things \nVillage Inn is known for is their pies. Wednesday \nis free pie day or something like that. They have \na large selection of pies right at the entrance if \nyou want to get a pie to go. If you come right around \ntheir closing time, sometimes they have pies that they\nare not allowed to sell but instead can only give\naway for free or else throw out - I guess going past\ntheir sell by date. So if you really like pie, keep \nthat in mind. ;)
4 ||| Ate here many, many months ago.  A favorite pizza place for Mom and me!!  She absolutely ADORES the spinach pie, while I enjoy it and many other varieties, including the Margherita and Alaskan (white sauce, seafood).  I really appreciate the fact that whole-wheat pizza crusts are available!  Wish more establishments would offer alternative options, such as whole-wheat and gluten-free for those w/ food allergies and issues...\n\nIf thin-crust pizzas rock your boat, like they do mine, then check out Nello's!
3 ||| The best place to watch a movie in town. If you are not in the Cine Capri that is okay the other Theatres are also nice, clean and kept up.\n\nIf you are going to see a big feature movie you want to see it at the Cine Capri because of the size of the screen and the sound system which is superior. \n\nGrowing up in Phoenix I use to go to the original Cine Capri on 24th st and Camelback to watch Star Wars and One of my first movies as a child - Jungle Book. What an impression that Theatre made on me.\n\nThe current location at Mayo and Scottsdale and is surrounded by shopping and restaurants. There is plenty of parking and the area is growing and safe.\n\nTheir popcorn is fresh and is popped right in front of you. Make sure you have your loyalty cup and buy a gift card for at least $25 to get the free popcorn and use it then to get your tickets.\n\nThis is my first choice place to watch a movie and will continue come here
4 ||| If you're around stop by and have the wood fired pizza! I promise its the best pizza you will ever eat. And not to mention the fantastic atmosphere! It is such a beautiful building with original architecture still in place. Amazing!
4 ||| The bagels are fresh and tasty. \n\nThe sandwiches are well made but seemed a little shy on the meat and cheese. \n\nThis place is great and I'd suggest it to anyone. \n\nSide note, the 12 year old girl that took my order over charged me by $3.00. When I told her she looked at me curiously as if she didn't understand what I said and then moved on to the next customer. The meal and dozen bagels I ordered were worth it and the $3.00 let's just say ended up being part of her tip.
3 ||| For the price, I would go somewhere else.\n\nThe service was excellent so I want to give them more stars. But for the same price, I'd rather go somewhere with a bit more diversity in their menu, from dishes to wines. Ok, their shrimp cocktail is good, their escargot is great (I don't know anywhere else in Madison I can get the same quality). However, the steaks? They are good, but I'm surprised they didn't have any dry-aged steaks. \n\nThe breads are delicious.\n\nOk the wine list. It has so much potential but for a fancy place like Tornado Steak House, I wish they had some more variety. \n\nIt's a good place, I've been here multiple times, actually, and each time I always feel like they're missing just one thing. I still recommend it, but not quite the place I'd keep returning to when I have the chance.
1 ||| The food portions are big and for a really great price. The reason for the three stars is for the poor service. Went in earlier this evening with two girlfriends and a total of three children. (We sat in the dining area) didn't seem very busy and there were two servers in the section. As soon as the waitress came over I felt like she was immediately irritated. She was very short with us and didn't seem to want to be bothered with us. We ended up coming to the conclusion it was because we had children with us. But I'm a little perplexed because they have a children's menu so she should be use to having families come in with kids. All three children were well behaved no screaming, crying running around or causing a scene to warrant such coldness. She would walk by and check on the other tables around us and pass us by. We all felt as if we really had to stare her down to come over and then when she would she was gone before we could finish what we were trying to say to her. Disappoints me because it's two min from my house. Maybe I'll try to come back with my husband and leave our son at home. But either way we are paying costumers and had well behaved children. We should have been treated with the same curtesy as the next guest.
2 ||| This is a chips, salsa and margarita review only. Salsa is 4 stars. Chips get 2 stars. Margaritas took an eternity to make and seemed to be limeaid, orange juice and a whisper of tequila. But the service... Ugh. 30 minutes to get our margaritas with maybe five other tables present (one who left because the waitress never came).   Next door at L&B, the margaritas took less than 5 minutes (though their salsa is inferior).
0 ||| If I could give a negative 5 this would be it they could not make fries could not make sundaes got the total wrong gave the wrong change shorting me $5.00 could not provide a receipt DO NOT come here
1 ||| Service  was good but order a strawberry Daqari that tasted terrible  sent it back.  I'm sorry but for a place that specializes in wings I felt like I just went to Walmart and bought Tyson wings and heated them  up in the microwave . I won't be eating  here ever again.
0 ||| Avoid at all costs! They misdiagnosed my problem and charged me thousands for repairs I did not need. My ac still doesn't work. These guys are scammers that take advantage of people. I hope you guys can sleep at night knowing you stole from a schoolteacher!
2 ||| If you are close to the area and you simply want a cheap beer with friends on a cold night, go for it. Just don't expect to get anything else out of it. The bartenders are pretty attentive and make strong drinks but I can't say the same for the food -- it's downright disgusting. \n\nThe ambiance is a little strange. After sporting events, they blast a collection of random music that has no flow. The crowd consists mostly of guys in their late 20s who wear beanies and fedoras and like to hunt the crowd in their high school wolf packs and cougars who most likely live in the area.
3 ||| I was on my way to the 101 on Main St when I passed by this and decided to pull in.  I found a few good items, paid $4 and change, and headed out again. I got some crossstitch material for about one fourth the new price and a couple of cute pins.  This is a nice store, not very big.\n(4/22/09)
3 ||| Nice and spicy like I like Indian food. Family operated friendly service. Indian movies in the background. Careful, the plate that says \"whole fish\" is not a whole fish, but a portion. Nice experience otherwise.
0 ||| People will likely keep coming here because of the location but that doesn't mean you have to.  I think we would all agree this is consistently the worst service ever experienced at any type business. Im surprised that people are shocked. It's clearly a corporate culture to try to be arrogant and pushy toward the customers.  They are acting like this on purpose. It would be too much of a coincidence that they hired the 20\nbiggest jerks in AZ. They have trained these people to make your life horrible.  The waiting area is high comedy as everyone is milling around commenting on how much they hate Cobblestone. Obviously just go any place else and you'll have a better experience. It would be impossible for it to be worse.  I bet their complaint department is just one giant paper shredder.
2 ||| This place has a good selection and its big. The positive remarks end there. Here are negatives: Anything remotely good is triple the price, everything is final sale, and the clincher, there is NO dressing room. I'll do my bargain hunting elsewhere, thanks.
4 ||| Great value sub sandwiches!! Love going here with a sweet location.
4 ||| Vons is one of my favorite markets in town. It has the best produce, fresh live herbs and extensive wines to choose from. I love that they also sell organic produce from local farmers and that they have a points system so you can earn discounts for gas.
2 ||| I have not been to this restaurant in over a year. I was somewhat excited to have an late lunch/early dinner of Italian today so I decided to give it another try.  The service was awesome. I was the first to request to dine outside and they quickly accommodated and provided attentive service.  I started with the appetizer of baked stuffed mushrooms that are stuffed with goat cheese, spinach and spicy Italian sausage.($8)  Tasty and I'm told popular, however I was not impressed and would never recommend them. Something about that spicy just didn't click for me though I like spicy food, I just felt it was not a good paring with the smooth mild goat cheese and mushroom.  Still it was the best thing I would eat at this experience. I ordered a Caesar salad ($3) - over priced should be free. A small handful of bitter romaine lettuce and a drizzle of Caesar dressing 3 or 4 croutons with a generous portion of cheese in a small bowl.  So bad it took three croutons to get the fork-full of lettuce down. The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill.  \n\nMy entr\u00e9e was to be Carbonaro ($13). I have had it at other restaurants and loved it. I have made it and served it to a number of people and they loved it. Never have I seen or even heard of a pouched egg served on this dish, as I was assured it must have to be Carbonaro. So I tried it. Noodles are some kind of pasta I never heard of but it's served hard and I mean about 3x harder than el dente' .  Sauce was not creamy and did not coat the noodles or the crisp ham in this case. sauce was tasteless. I tried about 3 bites but once asked I had to admit I didn't care for it. My server admitted it was quite different and agreed to bring me another entr\u00e9e.   So I went with the Chicken Malino ($12).  Roasted chicken, bow-tie pasta, creamy garlic sauce, mushrooms & sun-dried tomatoes.   Served in a large bowl. A generous portion  about 2 servings actually.  \nIt was better or as I told the server more palatable.  I ate half of it took the rest to go but feed it to my dog what does she know about good Italian anyway?\n\n\nRuby (my dog) says:\n\"Andiamo! Sono un cane-io non so nemmeno il cibo \u00e8 italiano!\"\n\nAnyway as I thought about the food after trying 2 entr\u00e9es I came to the this conclusion. The building, the tablecloths, the interior and even the patio are what this restaurant chain sells well.  It makes ones visit memorable.  It's the setting for a nice date or to bring out of town guest to, to socialize of  wines and to break bread together.  It's the backdrop to some nice dining photos as well.  It's moderately priced yet over priced after all it's mostly pasta and lettuce you're getting.  But when it comes to the food, they pretty much threw together ingredients that would sound or appear in print to be appealing.  It's a simple menu that doesn't take much talent or time to prepare.  It's really rather awful food placed in a beautiful setting. How anyone who can cook Italian or has ever been to one of the many little Italy communities in America or Canada can really say they love the food here is beyond my ability to believe or comprehend.  So if you go drink lots of wine and maybe you'll forget that the food is lousy you are buying.  But hopefully the staff will be attentive and keep your glasses full.  And maybe you'll get a few nice photos on your phone.  Oh and none of the food looks like it does in the pictures added to this review site! I knew I should have took pictures of something while there.  My meal plus ice tea ($2.50)  Was $24.51.  NOT a cheap date for my book.  Multiple that by 2 or more and add wine or other drinks and you'll scratch your head and ask yourself  \" For this I paid what?  And I'm hungry in 2 hours!\"  \nI gotta go I'm sure there's something in my home fridge that will hold me over until my next meal!
4 ||| A good friend of mine recommended this Salon. And I was at first hesitant because I wasn't sure what to expect. I really liked how my friend's hair was done. I had my hair cut short, new blond hair and highlights and stylized by the fabulous stylist Ellie. She really knows her craft. She was friendly, and she had great ideas when I asked her for suggestions for my hair. The salon has friendly staff, comfortable setting, the music was not very loud like other salons I have been to before. When my hair was washed afterwards it was relaxing and there was even beautiful relaxing music in the background. It was a fun days out!  I had some great hair therapy fun. And love my new hair! I'm definitely coming back! Thank you Ellie!
4 ||| Loved this place, cute tatami rooms with a television beside you attached to the wall showing all there is to offer on the menu with pictures added. I sat on my tatami mat and tried dragon and California rolls which were very fresh and yummy. I also tried the kalbi sticks all very tasty and enjoyable I will be back to try the hot stove where they cook right in front of you. The sake was great as well next time I will try the plum wine and a different desert as they have plenty to choose from ;).
3 ||| Not my favorite place, but you know what, the service is good, the pad see ew is legit and plentiful, and the curries are OK. \n\n3 stars because if you want to order green curry for lunch, you have to pay dinner prices for ($14! WHAT!?). There was an abundance of rice and chicken, but I didn't think it was salty enough. Next time I guess I would try the Red curry for lunch, or the Mussaman if I'm ever here on a Friday (available for lunch only Fridays).\n\nThis is odd, but I really really like the free soup that comes with lunch.
2 ||| We have been going to OLd Chicago for many years. Just never wrote a review?? The food is always OK. Service can very from time to time. The decor has not changed over the years. Probably is time for a face lift. Basically a sports bar pizza place decor. They have many beers to drink. I am not a beer drinker so that is not attraction to my. Meals are larger than you probably eat at a sitting. My wife and I usually split a meal. If you are into sports it is a good place to watch your favorite team while you eat. Very kid friendly and there is plenty of room for a large party.
2 ||| It has been years sense we visited the spaghetti warehouse, my husband and I couldn't remember why we haven't been back. We had purchased a groupon for this place and decided to try it for an early dinner... Our first step in the restaurant and then it hit us on why we haven't returned.. The odd smell hits you at first step in the restaurant , you look around in the foyer and you see weird and dilapidated pictures, a candy stand that probably hasn't been used in years.. We get seated in a booth with one side ripped and the other side stained, our waitress was nice but that is far as she went. The food is mediocre at best, the bread and the endless salad was the saving grace of dinner... We wanted to enjoy this place and tried to have a good time, we would not recommend this place to anyone... There are plenty of other good restaurants in the strip and in lawrenceville..
0 ||| This place is becoming one of the most don't stop off to Carl's Jr. This morning I ordered Cheeseburgers and when I got home two of then had no meat on them. Did not enjoy the cheese sandwich. Times before the so called fresh biscuits we like rocks, and the mile high burger had like broken pieces of bacon on top that looked like bacon bit's. These are the same people the take a day off to strike for $15.00 per hour, Your getting what you deserve. Take pride in your job, you choose it, guess I am now 100% Jack In the Box Man now. Shame on you all.
2 ||| This is my first review for this branch of Sammy's.  We've been here many times before, so it's unfortunate for them that I chose to review it this time.\n\nThe last few visit to Sammy's have been at their Centennial and Flamingo locations, and I raved about it.  This time wasn't such a fortuitous event.  \n\nWe shared one of their Tapas appetizers, the hummus with kobe beef, and that was fabulous.  It came with triangles of seasoned pita that stayed crisp to the end, and we sure did finish every drop of the hummus.\n\nWe followed it up with our standard - The Thai chicken salad.  The last time we had this was at the Centennial Sammy's, and it was so big we couldn't finish it.  This time it was skimpy, with half the amount of chicken, and not enough of the greens for us to be fully satisfied, and I'm not a big eater.  There used to be two sizes of this salad, but it was changed before we had it at Centennial, so it's definitely not a case of us having ordered a larger size last time.\n\nWhen we commented to the waiter (our waitress seemed to have disappeared and he was the only one working the room), he asked if we wanted to change it for something else.  We didn't.  It was late, and we'd already gone through most of it, which wasn't hard to do this time.  He then asked my husband if he'd like another beer.  It sure sounded as if he were comping it as a result of our negative comment, but when he brought the bill, there was the charge for that second beer!!  He did remove it, but it seemed to go hand in hand with the indifferent and unfriendly service that took over when our waitress split.\n\nThis Sammy's is a bit closer to our house than the others, and is usually more convenient when we're on our way back from the Strip or environs, but next time we'll have to rethink it.
1 ||| Is there a more snobby place to shop in the valley...  The selection is incredibly limited, everything's priced at least twice as much as it should be, and the staff is so incredibly unhelpful, if they were any less so the front door would be padlocked shut....
4 ||| This place is hit or miss! You roll the dice each time but I do believe it is better when Gary is at the helm!!! \n\nGary once threw in a few potstickers I believe his mom made that were top notch!\n\nI wish they could produce that quality on a consistent basis. I would definitely be there more often.
4 ||| I really love PF Changs.  They offer lots of vegetarian options (even lettuce wraps - YUM).  I went there the other night with a large party for someone's birthday.  We had reservations and the place was slow, so we sat right away.\n\nThe waitress was very prompt and attentive, even though we could all tell that she was a little worried about having a large party.  \n\nWe hardly waited at all for our dinners - which were a combination of vegetarian and meated dinners.  \n\nI had the Ma Po Tofu.  It was so good - and when I went home and looked up the fattiness thereof, it is a reasonable and healthful choice!  How exciting and refreshing is that?\n\nI will definitely go back to PF's.  (and it's little sister Pei Wei.)  Yum!
0 ||| I could stand the shit hotel rooms and the even shittier service, like running out of baileys. But when I apparently accidentally put my money on the wrong like in craps, after putting it on the same one a ton of times in a row, and lost? I draw the line there. Such BS. Do not come here if you wanna keep your money.
1 ||| I have tried to check this place out 5 different times now during times that their window schedule says they are supposed to be open and every time I go down there the place is closed. Im not sure how they stay in business when they are never open. Now I'm to the point that its not worth wasting the gas to go to this store since chances are that they wont be open when I get there.
4 ||| I love this place! They are at a great location and are open for most of the day. They sell a wide variety of basic \"grocery food\" along with making their own food. They sandwiches are amazing! Plus many of their items are from other Wisconsin business. I would highly recommend going here to get great food or just to stock up on some food items!!
2 ||| This place was not quite what I expected based on other reviews. I ordered the baked ravioli and garlic knots. The ravioli was not baked, they had good flavor but the sauce was bland marinara, from a baked pasta dish I would expect the melty cheese baked on top and maybe a little more flavor. These were nothing but your typical frozen, boiled then doused in sauce. They probably should take these off the \"Baked Pasta\" menu. \n\nThe garlic knots were great when they  were warm, as soon as they cooled off they were hard balls, almost as if they microwaved them before they were delivered. They did not come with any sauce, luckily my ravioli had more than enough. I'm not sure if this was a delivery mistake or that they just don't offer any dipping sauce.\n\nI'd have to say that this would probably have been a 2 star review have the delivery drivers not been as prompt and personable as they were (yes, \"they\", there were two).
4 ||| We go to PF Changs at least once every couple of months. I have never been disappointed by their food. Their orange peel shrimp is the bomb. We like it extra spicy. You can ask for white and brown rice. The black pepper prawns served with the mustard sauce are amazing but are best eaten fresh right over there. They get all soggy if you do takeout. Have you ever eaten their desserts? Try the Great Wall of Chocolate. It is huge. One order is good for like 6 people. Or if you are a chocolate lover like me...maybe good for just one. Giggles...\n\nThe service is sometimes not up to par but eventually it all works out. Lately it hasn't been that busy when we go, even on weekends but it is always good to call about half an hour before you get there on weekend nights because you never know how long the wait is going to be.
1 ||| I am the store currently waiting for one hour and half and they have not even started to replace my tires . The sales person said I needed tires when my mechanic told me I had 20,000 miles left this store seems very aggressive I am sad to say that their customer service had changed. I look curious if management will look into this
1 ||| Very busy and noisy on a football weekend. Food is quite average and service was very slow. The only bright spot was the diligence of the bus help in constantly filling the water glasses. Don't waste the calories here.
0 ||| About 7 years ago I purchased one of their mix-n-match 99.00 deals for my spare bedroom! After the set-up, I noticed that the box spring was completely made of cardboard!! The mattress was not much better and the WHOLE thing was thrown out in about 6 months! Well, I figured, you get what you paid for..my bad!! About 9 months ago I was back at Sleep America....thinking it was my mistake the last time...this time I spent almost 900.00 for a queen set for my teenage son. Every morning I have noticed a really funny sound when he is getting out of bed, and low and behold ...the box spring is CARDBOARD!!! MY BAD AGAIN for not inspecting, but I feel SOOO CHEATED!!! The mattress isn't that great either!! I will be replacing shortly and I can ASSURE you that I will NEVER step foor in a Sleep America again!! ughhh..BTW...it was not at this store...the store I purchased from was in Gilbert and is no longer there!
3 ||| My husband and I always come here the morning we're leaving vegas. \nWhy? Mainly because we're too cheap and don't have a dime to spend on extravagant buffets. Plus, if you have the Ace Card you get 25% Off and you can use the points on your card to deduct the amount. \nThe second reason is I like their Egg Benedict. =P\n\n\nHonestly, don't all buffets serve eggs, pancakes and such in the morning anyways?\nHow can any other buffets make better eggs? EXTRA SPIT PLEASE?!?!\n\nI don't dare come here for dinner though! =P
2 ||| Food here was just ok, and I'm pretty sure they are using MSG still. Every dish (including the house special chicken over which everyone was raving) was heavily salted and just plain bland tasting. Three stars awarded for quick and attentive service and reasonable prices. But I won't be returning.
1 ||| not  very pleased 2nd time around won't return.
2 ||| Very nice room and overall, a good experience.  just a few cons: TV had problems working, but desk person was able to fix it.  Also, people were smoking just outside the front door and directly beneath a sign that said no smoking within x Number of feet--makes for a very upsetting arrival.  Also, this shows very poor management on the part of the hotel.  Most importantly, this hotel is not easy to find, actually rather difficult to find and dangerous, just off a sharp curve.   So, be very careful.  \nIf not for the smoking issue, I would have given four stars.
2 ||| Course quality was great but the rangers were aggressive and unfriendly.  It ultimately ruined our day.  I'd play here again,  for the benefit of the doubt, but with the other choices in the valley, they'd better up their hospitality Little bit.
0 ||| My boyfriend and I booked a room on the executive floor for new years. We got here right at check out time and we were told it would be another 20 minutes before the room was ready....an hour later, here we are in our room with a bath tub that the paint is chipping off of and the tv doesn't work. We were charged for a movie that we can't even watch. Highly dissapointed. You would think that with a big name like Hilton, the room and service would be superior. Very lackluster.
4 ||| I recently went exploring this place and discovered some of the best potato salad (deli) that I've had in a very long time! Who knew Russian potato salad would rival our American classic?? \n\nYasha rang up my order (yes, Yasha...the owner...from Russia...get it?) Very nice older dude. \n\nI got a little bit of a lot of things. Loved the lager. Loved the chocolate. The deli meats were good but if you're unsure about any, just ask for a sample. The cookies, also in deli case, were super slammin! Not a traditional cookie. These were rolled and filled w/ dried fruit or chocolate.  Yummmy!
0 ||| The old saying, \"if you don't have anything nice to say, then it's better left unsaid\" is so true with this company. \nYes, they are plumbers. Hopefully they are better with plumbing problems inside of a home than outdoor sprinkler systems.\nYet - If they disconnect any electrical lines you really need to check and see if they are all working okay, because if they aren't you are out of luck. No yard lights across the front of our house now. They never found the leak in the sprinkler line either.\nI won't call them again. My husband may, but it would be a wasted effort with only rude remarks intended our direction from the manager. I recommend checking YouTube first if a problem arises than to call this company, if nobody else is available.\nI tried to be nice about it but I'm the one who will have to dig up the trench & fiddle with the electrical lines to see if I can have yard lights again!! UGH!!
0 ||| It Hurtz Horrible. Two painful experiences in a month. On my first  the front desk persons were slow, unfriendly and grumpy. Car was filthy and when I pointed this out and requested a clean cat they offered me an upgrade for a fee. I returned car and left two phone/lap top chargers in car charger. They have not been turned over to lost and found so the staff is stealing. My second trip reaffirmed that the staff was not just having a bad day but that were bad everyday. On my return I was hurrying and did not refill gas. Drove locally around Charlotte for two days and used about 1/4 tank. I was charged $115 for a full tank and service. The mileage recorded is EXAXTLY 200 miles indicating that the just guessed an amount. HurtZ claim I returned the car completely empty but has no record or the inspection sheet. So I thought I would be helpful and do the customer survey on the hertz web site. But I needed a 5 or 7 digit access code. Three reps gave me codes that did not work. I asked the third to hold while I tried the code and he said I should call back if it did not work. http://www.hertzsurvey.com/  My exp with Hertz has been very good over many years but at Charlotte Douglas airport I will use another company, next time. One Love
4 ||| Me and my Family love coming to this restaurant all the time.  We love the beef Pho soup especially.  We're planning on coming again this Friday for some Pho soup!  The place always packed.  Sometimes it takes a while waiting on food or your check but the food always good.
4 ||| My 2001 Audi was having a lot of trouble (AC not working, wiper fluid by deploying, trunk hatch broken) and I went to Zimbrick to have it evaluated-- the bill was over $1000 to have everything replaced. I brought my car over to Dunn's and they quickly realized that a few things needed to be adjusted, and nothing needed to be replaced at all! Could have charged me just short of my previous estimate but the bill was tiny. Earned my trust. And they we're incredibly accommodating with my unaccompdaying schedule. Have been bringing my vehicles here, and recommending heavily, ever since.
1 ||| 1 - There were bars on the windows\n2 - The inside smelled like urine\n3 - A homeless guy came in and tried to steal my food\n\nI can get past the ambiance, a lot of hole in the wall places actually have good food. I ordered the beef enchilada platter. I am about 85% certain the meat was not beef but rather dog or possibly a horse. Instead of red or green sauce they used some kind of brown gravy. The rice and beans were just a step below what you would find in a tv dinner.
4 ||| North Carolina has 3 D & D and Chicago has zero? I love the grocery store attached to this place If I didn't just go nuts at Dillard's, I would have had room in my bags. We were there for a late dinner. I actually thought they were closed as it was just before 9. We started with a bottle of Parcel 141. I ordered the Chilean Seabass. Very light and flaky with a mild buttery taste. The server was on top of us for the whole meal. Aces to this place, as well as the eclectic mellow atmosphere. Very relaxing. We took a bourbon pecan pie and key lime to go as we had already eaten more than enough. Or was that drinking I was thinking of? Great place. Would love to go back!
1 ||| First of all, I would like to acknowledge that this review has nothing to do with the staff. Our waitress was very pleasant, friendly, and attentive, as was every other staff member with whom we interacted. The positives ended there, though. The salsa is probably the most bland salsa I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant. I asked for spicier salsa, and it wasn't any better-- and definitely was NOT spicy. Onto our meals. Very overpriced, to begin with. $11 to choose 2 items off of an a la carte menu? Seriously? My husband thought his meal was just okay (chicken enchilada and chile relleno), but the enchilada sauce was horribly bland. I ordered the vegetable fajitas. They brought out the standard fajita plate (guac, sour cream, tomatos, lettuce, beans, tortillas), but the vegetable fajita dish was steamed broccoli, squash, and zuccinni with absolutely no seasonings. I've NEVER had a Mexican restaurant serve me plain steamed broccoli for fajitas! I asked about the traditional fajita vegetables (the grilled, seasoned peppers and onions) and was told that I would have to pay extra for a side of them. Wait... I ordered veggie fajitas but actual fajita veggies cost extra?? By the end of the meal, we had paid almost $30 when we could have had a better \"Mexican\" meal at Taco Bell for $7. I won't be going back to Macayo's... even if someone else is picking up the tab.
2 ||| Aveda salons, in my opinion, have a reputation of being soothing, presentable and tasteful.  Unfortunately, Tangles Salon lacked all three of those attributes.  I'd been to the former Tangles locations for pedicures a handful of times and decided to visit their new location when a Living Social coupon was recently offered.  I received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what I spent on the Living Social coupon I am satisfied with the results, but if I had paid full price for these services I would be very dissatisfied.  \n\nThere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at Tangles.  The salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  I didn't get that \"Aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"Cost Cutters vibe\" (nothing against CC, but if I'm paying $75 for highlights I'd like the atmosphere to match the price).  Next time I'll resist the lure of a good deal and go elsewhere.
3 ||| 5 & Diner is okay for a quick bite.  The food is just okay, typical diner food.  The place it's self feels very old. . and not. . .\"oh cool, I feel like I'm in the 50's\" cool.  It has an old feel.  Needs some revamping (chipped paint, ripped benches, broken table juke boxes).  Staff was friendly and helpful.
3 ||| Growing up in Arizona, the Buttes were always known to me as an awesome place to stay, although I never did because, well, I lived there. But as an adult coming back to the valley to visit, this place left me wanting more. Don't get me wrong, the grounds are awesome, the bartenders and staff are great and the breakfast is delicious, but the rooms really need a total revamp. Our room was large, and you could tell they had recently updated them, but an update isn't enough. Our shower knob just turned and turned so it was a guessing game as to when it would turn on or off, as well as what the temp would be, there was a solid inch gap where the faucet had pulled from the wall and someone tried to caulk it, but it was hideous and didn't work, our room still had a hideaway bed in the wall, very creepy!  The decor has got to go. Other than the outdated rooms and the millions of bees swimming next to you in the pools, this was a fun place to stay. They had live bands or Djs on the weekends by the pool, it was very lively, there are a few hidden hot tubs placed high in the mountain sides, overlooking the rest of the pool, and they had many great areas to get an awesome view of the beautiful Arizona sunsets.
4 ||| I've been eating at McAlister's for what seems like years. Always good yet I always seem to stand there staring at the menu like I can't figure out what to eat. There is a lot to choose from with hot & cold sandwiches, soups, even spuds (I like mine with chili, cheese and extra jalapenos, please). Of course their sweet tea is up there with the best of them and I'm also a fan of the large chocolate chip cookies. This particular location in Matthews is the one I frequent the most. Friendly staff! McAlister's is a great \"go to\" place when you can't decide where to go.
2 ||| I do appreciate a non-chain coffee shop.  But this one isn't great.  Here's why...  They don't have ANY support for using a laptop computer.  Sure, they have Wifi.  But NO power outlets anywhere.  They have this little 'room' off to the side with comfy couches, etc.  But its so damn small that unless you are the only person in there, its crowded.  And its not comfortable.  The owner/manager acts more like a dictator than a friendly business owner.  He's not really interested in developing relationships with anyone, but he sure likey the money.  That's sad.  These coffee shops should be a haven for friendly local business.  But this isn't like that.  Its nice that its different than the average Starbucks.  But as for friendliness and comfort, it ain't cutting it.  Not my ideal choice, unfortunately.
1 ||| The chicken is alright. The commercial is very misleading because my chicken did not look like the one on TV. The sides were alright and the salsa bar was good until I witnessed a 3 year old girl slobbering all over the spoon and vigorously dipping her infested hands in to the sauce/salsa containers. Very unappealing to say the least. I told the child's mother and the store manager about the blatant condiment violation and they both looked at me with the intent to trick me that they did not speak English. They succeeded because the little girl was still using the salsa bar as her private playground. No salsa for me!!!
2 ||| We went here to get some screws we needed, which wasn't too bad; once the lady ahead of us decided to get off her cell phone and talk to the parts guy instead.\nWhile we were there, we asked about getting some new keys cut.  I had just gotten some on the internet for less than 50$, but still needed them cut and programmed.  The guy at the parts counter said they couldn't cut those keys.  They might be from china or something and break their laser.....I am almost positive the laser isn't doing the cutting.  After we called him out on that, he did backpedal and say it might break the machine and not the laser.  We asked how much to get keys done there if we ordered them from him.  It was over 500$.  So I took my keys to Anytime lock and safe and got them cut for under $100.00, and now I have two new keys and the old flip key and valet key all programmed for my car.....\nWhy does the dealer think we have bags of money?
2 ||| The first thing you will notice about this review is that I'm giving the highest rated restaurant in Arizona a 3/5. This place is the only 5 Diamond restaurant in Arizona. That's a pretty heavy distinction to live up to. I can't say they didn't live up to it, but I can't say \"WooHoo\" about my visit either.\n\nI want to point out that this place has what I can only imagine is a true 5 Diamond experience down to a well orchestrated and choreographed science. The menus came with a story - as did the food and everything we consumed. It was a little heavy-handed. Hand-painted menus and live pan flute music playing in the background along with a waiter/narrator/story teller coming to our table every few minutes to be our personal wikipedia for the evening.\n\nThe food was good, but this is one of those places that has tiny portions presented on big plates. Most courses were mere bite-sized morsels. Many were complimentary as some of us ordered items with more courses than others. I wouldn't ever again go out of my way for the food here. Nothing spoke to me. In fact, I don't really remember much of what I ate. I know I had a steak at one point. A bone-in rib-eye that had quite a bit of gristle. \n\nThe service was incredible. It was over the top. That was the biggest problem here really. There were four of us dining, and they kept referring to us by our last names - Mr. and Mrs. so and so and Mr. and Miss. such and such and whats her face. It was off-putting enough to all of us that we requested they knock it off. Every time they brought out a drink or a course, there was a brigade of waiters carrying shit. Six people serving four. It was too much. \n\nI guess I'm just not the type of person who needs that much pampering. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Maybe I need to seek therapy for it - they'll tell me I don't love myself enough and make me cry about my dad because I don't feel like I deserve that kind of service. But seriously, it's overkill. \n\nThis is the sort of think that people with too much money and not enough self-esteem need to do to feel powerful and important. I've heard that sometimes rich billionaire oil barons just shit in the bed instead of going to the bathroom and they have people who clean up after them. They apparently keep these habits when they stay at hotels sometimes as well. \n\nIt just all reminds me of the gap between the super-rich and the rest of us... the elimination of the middle class. \n\nThe whole thing is overpriced if you're not all about every bit of it. You have to like the pampering, the stories, the food, and the special imported drinks. If you appreciate all of that, then you will enjoy yourself. Most of it just made me feel like a pretentious asshole.\n\nFor me, I'm happy if you don't spit on my food, make sure I have my refills on my drink, and that you don't seat me next to the bathroom. The food is why I go out to eat - not to have someone serve or entertain me. The food here just wasn't strong enough on its own\n to warrant a return.\n\nI will say this though - the view is amazing and the place is beautiful, tranquil, and classy.
1 ||| This was our second visit to Smoky's last night, after a long period in between. The decor had been updated which is nice, however, that's about the only positive thing I have to report.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant we were told there was a 15 Minute wait (sat night). So, we went to the bar. It was not busy..after 45 min upon approaching the hostess she said she had told us to just come back over when we were ready....odd that I had to give her my name for her list...she did not say anything like this to us. She stated she was \"sorry for the communication error\" and did nothing.\n\nThe best thing about the meal was the salad (Roquefort dressing) and the modified cottage cheese. My steak was ordered medium rare and one side was so charred it was well done. Could have sent it back as others have stated but after an hour and 45 min, we had it. The meat was not seasoned and was bland. My husband has prepared steak MUCH better than this.\n\nIf we wouldn't have had a gift certificate we would have left with the hostess oversight. We won't ever be back again and wouldn't recommend dining here to anyone. Too many other choices in Madison that are stellar compared to the service and quality of food we received.
4 ||| I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!
1 ||| It was a decent experience.  The kids and I had just finished 7 hours of rides at Castles N Coasters and were thirsty and starving.  We started driving north around the Metro Center Circle.  The first contender for dinner was Olive Garden.  I pulled in and saw the groups of people waiting to be seated with pagers.  We had no time to wait.  We kept driving and saw Swensen's.\n\nThe place was almost empty.  I ordered the veggie burger and it was decent.  My girls shared the chicken strips and hated them.  They had big chunks of pepper in them and it was to spicy of a flavor for them.  When I told the waitress her response was that they are not spicy and everyone loves them.  I thought that odd and she never offered to remove them from the bill even though no one ate them.  I don't remember what my son ate- possibly a hamburger.  \n\nThe highlight of the meal of course was the dessert.  The huge sundaes were DELICIOUS.  The bill was $38... one adult meal with drink, two kids meals, one premium sundae and one scoop sundae.  I think that is pricey.
2 ||| We are longtime Outback customers but stopped going after they went so commercial with higher prices and lower quality food. We love the food at this restaurant but the mgmt needs to deal with the young wait staff. They can have a very matter of fact attitude that doesn't come across well to a customer. Also, the bathrooms at this location could definitely stand to be cleaned. There is about 2 inches of dust and grime around each stall and against the wall. \n\nSteaks here are great but the service can definitely use some help.
3 ||| Tasty local grub. Not cheap but fresh and delicious.
2 ||| I just attended a wedding here in early June. DO NOT BOOK it in the heat of the summer! Even though the fountains' ambiance gave it that babbling brook sound, it did nothing to offset the heat. I was amazed no one passed out! They tried fans on the sides but they blew so hard, no one could sit near them or hear anything.And even though we were moved into the reception area after 1/1/2 hours of pictures, the room never cooled off enough with the amount of attendees..To make matters worse, after the cake was cut, we were asked to relocate back outside for dancing so the staff could clean up. It was still over 100 degrees out there at 9 p.m.! If you are going to spend that  kind of money in the summer months in Phoenix, go with an all air conditioned venue for the guests to enjoy.And there were only two  female bathrooms available for guests to use, so there were lines often.\nNow on the positive,the garden was very nice although the roof of the reception area was dirty and made it appear dark.I will rate the food as o.k.because they ran out of lamb kabobs,one of the three meats offered along with chicken kabobs and roast beef , the salad was a bit wilted, most likely due to the heat ,and some of the other dishes were dry. and finally, the mashed potatoes they served were instant.I did not dare try the sushi table in that heat.The staff was excellent, very attentive,polite and pleasant. They were working very hard the entire time.
4 ||| fantastic! great service, atmosphere was lovely and the food was delicious! \n\nwent in for a quick dinner last night and the brought over warm rolls and recommended a few entrees. I started with the beet salad and would highly recommend it! pretty large portion for an appetizer salad. had the salmon for my main course and it was cooked to perfection! \n\nwould come back here next time I'm in the area!
4 ||| Got my car detailed today, not only did they do a great job, but I opened my cup holder to find a graduation gift (Tiffany's necklace) that I thought was long gone. Their good work & honesty have definitely earned my future business.
0 ||| This burger joint operates in the Green Valley Ranch Casino and is a Fatburger franchise.  Now Fatburger is renowned in California for their juicy delicious burgers.  However their reputation does NOT translate to the Green Valley Ranch Casino location.  I went there about a month ago and asked for a medium large fatburger, hold the relish and mayo.  The mayo and relish were held however the burger came as a salty grossly overcooked piece of meat, more tasteless than the inexpensive major burger chains and cost $11.45.  I was shocked.  I recently returned and placed the same order for a large fatburger medium rare.  The waitress said fine.  Again to my surprise I received an overcooked burger loaded with salt. A piece of shoe leather would have been more appetizing!!  Again I paid $11.45.  Two times is enough for me.  This place is the WORST and does not come close to living up to the Fatburger standards. This franchise needs to be closed. You would do better and cheaper eating at any other burger joint in Las Vegas and there are many.
3 ||| Yikes?  What happened to authentic Japanese Sushi?\n\nIf you like the litany of sexy body parts and earthly dragon named sushi that are extreme variations of traditional sushi, then this is the place for you.\n\nI prefer more traditional and authentic sushi and so it is hard really to taste the flavors of the sushi in a restaurant like this because the sauces and fried stuff and mixture is kinda overpowering.\n\nBut hey, I like to have ketchup on my steak once in a while, and so, I have come here several times and will come again as it ain't bad, but it really isn't real Japanese food, it is blended to the American taste.....
3 ||| I have only been here a couple of times.  My last visit was for some material for a table cloth.  I don't know my way around a fabric store and the staff here were very helpful.  I knew what I wanted when I went in and they pointed me in the right direction.  The person cutting the fabric was very nice and the check out was fast.  I was in and out in less than 10 minutes.
3 ||| Front 9 plays like a links course.  The back nine is gimmicky and filled with target golf.  That said, this place offers good value for the golfer and GPS is complimentary.  Summers get pretty hot so be sure to hydrate up.
0 ||| I have never in all my life...\n\nI went there with a group of about 12 people after the South End Gallery Crawl on Friday night. We walked inside first so we saw that it wasn't very crowded. We could also see that there was no great influx of people because we sat outside near the front door and next to a window.\n\nI did not expect the fastest service at 8:00 on a Friday night with a group of 12. I was having fun so that was OK. I was also not expecting such a completely terrible fiasco of an evening. \n\nWe waited over an hour for our food (very simple appetizers with one or two sandwiches), but not because they were busy, it was because the waitress waited forever to enter the order. When a few people spoke up about the wait, the waitress ARGUED with us and said that the order was just entered and that's what took so long. Really? I still do not understand why that was her defense. She waited 45 minutes to enter our order and that was supposed to be OK?? \n\nAfter a little more lip from the waitress a few people asked for the manager. He didn't come out right away so the leader of the group went in to talk to him. He told her that we weren't upset, she was just drunk. She actually came back to the table crying! What on earth made him think this was OK to say???\n\nSomeone else went in to talk to him but it turns out out that he was busy because he was watching the surveillance video to see what happened. Are you serious? I have worked in restaurants before and have NEVER had one of my bosses do that. It actually bothered me the way that they just gave into anything from a whimper to a tirade. I know that's the way it's supposed to be done though, not \"Tell them I'll be out in a minute. I need to watch the video first\".\n\nAnyway, when the manager finally came out, he argued with us, too! After a few minutes of telling us we were wrong he finally asked if he wanted us to comp the meals. We said \"no\" because that would imply that we were satisfied and would be coming back. It's not that we minded paying, we just didn't want to be treated like street trash. \n\nHe just had a very bad attitude and was completely unprofessional. I will never, ever go back there again. It was a terrible experience. \n\nAnd the food wasn't that good either.  :(\n\n(I was tired and wrote \"professional\" instead of \"unprofessional\" the first time).
2 ||| Go to They Yard House.... For Beer and Food....\n\nYes - The Yard House is chain but their food is 100000x.  The menu actually sounds more appealing and the food actually is better..\n\nI was looking forward to going to 4 Peaks after hearing great things.  I certainly enjoy a nice cold beer.  (Which they don't have at 4 Peaks - b/c apparently room temperature and slightly colder are the perfect temps to bring out the flavor?!?!  - if thats the case - then why was the frosty mug created?)\n\nOur water was great - straight up honest about what he likes and didn't in regard to the menu - which I really appreciate.\n\nOverall - unimpressed....
0 ||| Oh my gosh these people SUCK! I called to get some information and spoke with a lady named Devin or Davin and she could not have been more awful. It was clear they were totally not into helping their locals. She was rude short and completely annoyed at my calling. I will never recommend or use this company or any other company associated with them (Union, ANLV, Vegas Western, Virgin Valley, Ace, ABC).
3 ||| This is your typical large-scale chain American food restaurant that wins on customer service and consistency. A bonus is the portion sizes are large enough for two meals and their amazing desserts. \n\nAll the pasta dishes are great -- if you love bacon try the Pasta Carbonara. It's my go-to dish here for the moment. My pass favorites include Chicken Bellagio and the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes. \n\nI've had a few sandwiches here -- the club and the cheesesteak. I don't really like the cheesesteak, it just doesn't have that delicious steak and cheese combination flavors like Corleones. However, the club is one of my favorite club sandwiches found anywhere and it's particularly good on a really hot Arizona day with an iced tea or a coke. \n\nThe service is always great -- friendly and personable -- and they seem to have the timing down of when to check-up on the table.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the Cheesecake Factory is their hours: they are open super late for the area, 11:00PM on weekdays and 12:00AM Thursday through Saturday. \n\nOne downside is I really don't like their alcoholic drinks. They are really strong (as in not blended right) and taste like they use super cheaper liquor. \n\nOh and breakfast: not good here. I had the breakfast sandwich made with french toast and bacon. It sounded amazingly delicious but it was so gross I didn't even want to it. Something about cheese and french toast just didn't go together well for me. \n\nThis a great place for two people or large groups. Bear in mind the noise level can be a bit loud so come later in the day if you want a quiet meal.
0 ||| 2 hours to get a pizza on a weekday evening because they somehow lost my online order.  When it did arrive, it was greasy and flavorless.  The sauce was bland and canned crap.  An extra star because my delivery driver was nice, but there's really too many better options (Salvatore's Tomato Pies, Ian's, Glass Nickel. Pizza di Roma) in Madison to eat this crap.
1 ||| We arrived at 8:20 for the all you can eat shrimp. When we approached the hostess, she informed us that she would seat us, but they are closing the dining room and we'd be the last customers. I'm unsure why this was relevant, it only made me feel like an inconvenience and that she was doing us a favor. My son got the shrimp those were good. These rest of our meals were awful. I got the roast beef sandwich and it was so greasy I couldn't pick it up, the bun fell apart on the bottom. The Mac and cheese was not much above kraft. The pasta was way over cooked. I was going to give 2 stars until we sat and waited 20 minutes after we were done eating for someone to address we needed the check. After we received our food we did not see anyone until that point, once the 3 of us had to stare down the staff to get attention.
4 ||| Perfect breakfast. Service was fast. My waffle with fresh fruit was huge and delicious. Price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get.
4 ||| My favorite pizza joint in Scottsdale.
2 ||| Even as a first timer to this city of lights, I had to go cheap since I was a broke college student on Spring Break.  Luckily my friends planned for us to stay at Hooters, and one word definitely defined my experience: ghetto.\n\nYep... there's nothing special about Hooters honestly, but the real deal-sealer for here is that it was CHEAP, and since we were never really in the rooms, it wasn't a huge issue.  The hotel is located off the strip across from MGM, and parking (like everywhere else in Vegas) is pretty generous.\n\nRooms were small.  There were two queen sized beds for you and a friend to share. Ice and vending machines are available on each floor for your convenience (we definitely had a bath tub of liquor to start).  There is a pool outside that is open 24 hours, but be sure to have a shirt on when you come back in.  The staff doesn't like people who go in and out shirtless.  And another bad part... there is no wireless internet available. (shute, even Motel 6 down the street has wifi!?)\n\nAs for the Casino, it wasn't bad, although the Hooters $100 free play in slots is pretty deceiving.  I blew all of that in 12 rounds, so it is highly unlikely that you'll be making much money.  Although I did learn how to play craps that night!  Dealers were pretty legit.\n\nSo it's ghetto, but cheap.  I can't complain.
0 ||| Where do I start. This is the absolute worst place i've ever been to. I wouldnt go there if the services were free. When we walked in the place was so dirty and dusty. It was so hot in there. They had fans running to cool the place. We got the deluxe pedi's. The two girls doing the pedis didn't even know what they were doing. They kept asking Linda what to do. They didn't scrub or massage or clip our toe nails. Most places soak your feet first. This place didn't do that. Not a professional business at all. The women including the owner were wearing cutoff jeans folded up. I was suppose to get a full set after my pedi and i was smart to cancel that. Right after this horrible experience of a pedi I went to another nail salon and got my pedi redone. Please dont waste your money.
2 ||| As far as customer service, they receive an A+. Wonderful staff. \n\nAlthough, the food is not my cup of tea. I ordered a side caesar to begin and a pepperoni calzone. The caesar dressing was very fishy. The pizza sauce was way too sweet.
2 ||| I'm as afraid to write this review as I was to admit:\n...My love for Anne Murray songs...\"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry...\"\n...How sometimes I chew my toenails off...(and save them for salad toppings.)\n...That yes, once, once for a year or so, I smoked Capris Ultra Lights. Menthol. 120s. \nBut I went to Olive Garden. And I enjoyed it. Stuffed mushrooms. Better than Oregano's. Fettuccini Alfredo...sauce clinging to noodles like The Hills girls to their careers....just barely and not smothering. The infamous salad...you know what?...quite good and with those galdarn breadsticks, almost orgasmic. Rickie's Marsala chicken...perfect...really! \nI had generic wine with great service and left very happy. Shout out to Stephanie especially who served and put up with a gaggle of urbanites in tacky paper tiaras. And a mini shout out to Susan who assisted for putting up with the gang but not having quite the mojo as Stephanie. Olive Garden. Ugh. Don't make fun of me for eating here. Don't reprimand me for clogging yelp with a tacky chain review. Just don't! I had fun. We ate. Even took home leftovers. I'm from Minnesota and have no idea what authentic Italian food is. I'm SURE this isnt' it. And those who complain that it's not are clearly delusional. IT'S NOT. But tonight was a blast and worthy of a solid 3.5 star review. Thank you for dining with us this evening and have a good night.
3 ||| Food was average to good overall. Excellent service. Good choice for pub basic type food with some very well made micro beers.
3 ||| I get my hair done here by J.T. and she is amazing. When I moved here 5 years ago I went through 3 hairdressers before she was reccomended to me and I haven't looked back in the last 3 years. She is booked solid most of the time but if you can wait for an opening she is worth it. (I always book my next appointment when I am there so I don't have any issues getting in)\nI have complex curly hair and have never had the \"too short because most hairdresser don't know about curl factor\" nightmare that I used to experience.
2 ||| This location featured a super nice old man who gave me free flavored biscotti which was nice.  They had a decent deli cabinet but I came for the muffaletta because I had been cravin since leaving NOLA.  It was acceptable, price good, but quality just not the same.  TINY in size but the price was much cheaper, the topanade was too coarsely chopped and it was a bit oily/greasy.  Not a terrible sandwich if you are used to eating Wis. muffs, but compared to the real deal from General Groc. its not on par.
4 ||| I think this place is great. The food is terrific, the staff is great. The location and parking are fine. This is nothing fancy, but it's fast and good. \n\n\nSo, mainly, they serve Fajitas but there are other things on the menu. I've never eaten any of them and, in fact, I never even looked at them. We get  1/2 pound of the \"Cadillac\" which is filet mignon for the meat and it's plenty for two of us. I'd be just as happy with skirt steak or chicken but we like to upgrade things when we can. It comes with sour cream, cheddar cheese and some kind of tomato/onion salsa. Oh, and you get chips and salsa before the meal!! I got a \"salad\" as part of my meal. I don't recommend it. It was tiny and expensive for a slice of tomato and iceberg. The grilled zucchini is a nice add on if you want more food. \n\nThe food, overall, is a tad bit high for the kind of place this is, IMHO. You have to order the extras separately, but those are things like beans, rice and guacamole.  But, I didn't deduct much for that experience. But, the decor is old. It looks like this place has been around a long time and everything is showing wear and looks a bit dated. Charming in a way, but not that much. Maybe in 25 more years it'll be charming in a good way, if they wait it out. LOL. \n\nI enjoy this place and look forward to eating there when we can.  I always leave full and happy.
0 ||| What a disgrace this Restaurant is. The minute we walked in, their was a \"bunch\" of Teenager Employee's hanging around laughing and doing Nothing. When the floor and the table's were dirty. It looked like a \"bunch of kid's hanging out\". They ALL walked in the back room, when they seen us, walk in with \"our family\". \n\nWe bought a \"Foot Long Roast Beef Sandwich\" and a Bag of Chip's. The Kid said, \"He did not have any White Bread\". I could only choose Wheat or Rye Bread. Well, we don't like Wheat or Rye Bread. But we took Wheat Bread. Then \"Our Sandwich had such \"Paper, Paper-Thin\" Meat and Cheese inside of it. It was disgusting. I felt like we PAID for a BUNCH of LETTUCE, TOMATOE'S AND PICKLE'S WITH BREAD\". It was Terrible.\n\nThe Cheese and the Meat were PAPER, PAPER-THIN. It was a JOKE !\n\nAnd the Potatoe Chip's are Like $1.00 Each and ALL YOU GET, is a 1/4 of a Bag. Come On, Mr. Good Cent's. Quit Ripping Off the People. Never, again.
2 ||| Went here last night for my cousins birthday dinner. The atmosphere was cool, the live music was good and the slide they have inside the restaurant was fun for the kiddos. The food however...not so good. It's pretty pricy and on the chicken dish my sister got there was nothing but fat, and I tried one of my grandmother's BBQ ribs and there was barely any meat at all on those either. Definitely not worth the $20 a plate... Probably the only sweet thing about the food was the cotton candy they bring you at the end. Even the biscuits they serve you at the beginning were cold and crumbly. Then at the end the server was even allowed to split up the check! We had to figure it out ourselves. All I can say is I was not impressed...
3 ||| This place, according to what I have heard, was supposed to be like Globe-Miami mexican food.  So Megan and I make the trek out there, it's in AJ and we live in West Mesa, so it's quite the drive.   We are so excited., as I grew up in Globe and hardly ever get up there anymore.  And I LOVE the mexican food.  Irene's, Chalos, Libby's El Rey, etc.   It looks like a Globe place, and the people in there defintely have that small town Globe hick look about them too.  The food......just ok.  What was weird is that the taco meat was nice and warm, but the taco shell was cold.  For god's sake, heat up your taco shells, Elvira!  Megan got a combination bean and green chili burro enchilada style, and I got a combination red chili and bean burro enchilada style.  Both had one taco.  They were....ok.  Service was great though.  Not worth the trek though, won't go back.
2 ||| Was in Phoenix and decided to stop off at Filiberto for a quick lunch before I had to catch a flight home. \n\nI would best describe Filiberto's as a fast food joint a set up from Taco Bell. Basically it's a fast food joint with lots of mexican fast food items such as Burritos, Tacos, and Tortas. Prices here are a bit more than you would expect from a fast food joint and you're looking around $4 - $8 depending upon what you order. \n\nI decided to go with the Carne Asada Tortas Combo. I was hoping to be in an out but the food took a long time to cook. I probably waited about 10 minutes before the food came out. The Tortas was a good size and was a mix of good and bad. The Carne Asada had good flavoring but was tough and the guacamole while good was layered on there thick. It was to the point where I got a guacamole torta with some carne asada topping to it. The fries here - well frozen Costco fries. \n\nAs to ratings, Filiberto is ok. It fills a need and nothing more. Overall you can do better but if in a jam and looking for someplace, will work. 3 Star rating for Filiberto's.
2 ||| I am not sure if this is the actual grocery or what, but I will review it as such.\n\nThis is a small bakery that has great breads and pastries.  They also have a small grocery with specialty items and some of their own sauces, spreads and oils.  Their produce is always fresh and fairly priced.  They even make their own large dog biscuits which sell for only $1.50 each.  My dogs definitely approve.\n\nOne Saturday afternoon I went in around 3pm and they had the loaves of bread buy one get one free.  I don't know if this happens in the late afternoon every weekend or if I just got lucky.
2 ||| I finally got a chance to come to the original location. It was late on a Thursday night. Like 8ish late and the fabulous Dottsy decided she wanted some chicken and waffles. So off we went to get their before they closed. This place is small and quaint and I can see how the lines are around the corner on the weekend. Get in and get out people lol. The staff were friendly and the food was delicious as always. Plus they were playing some jams while we enjoyed our food and they didn't rush us at all even though they were closed by the time we were done. If I am ever back on this side of town, I just may have to stop in and get my fried chicken and waffle fix.
2 ||| Classic bate and switch. I chose this practice as my PCP because they have a few docs on the Phx Top Doc list. But you cannot see them! When you call in you can only see a resident. I am going to have to call my insurance and change my PCP again. If I wanted to see residents I would go to the ER.
4 ||| I cannot wait to go back to Liberty Market!  I had the Farmer pressed sandwich and it was delicious!  The side pasta salad was good, too.  The other sides and desserts looked amazing!  I want to go back and try everything. \nAlso- staff was very friendly.  You just get a good vibe being in there.
4 ||| Like a little sam's club but less crowded and more options to buy things. Like a grocery store/costco in one! Love this store
4 ||| LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! The food here is wonderful and the wait staff and bar are so friendly, you really couldn't ask for anything more! I love the new expansion to the bar area, and whenever we think good Italian food, we always pick arrivedercis. You won't be dissappointed!
1 ||| The food is a joke.  I can understand if you like the atmosphere, but let's all get serious about the food.
2 ||| I didn't like the free samples and I should have just walked away. However, there isn't much for quick snacks at the Premium Outlets that you don't have to stand in a long line for. \n\nA pretzel and a pretzel dog later, my stomach wished I had just went else where. I guess it's not for everyone - and that everyone is me. \n\nIf you disagree, that's ok - you can have them all for yourself
2 ||| We wanted to have chinese one night for dinner in honor of Chinese New Year so we chose to come here Friday night. I know there are plenty of options near us but specifically we wanted good roast duck and was steered here upon my search.\n\nWe had: \n\n2 BBQ Combination Plate (Roast Duck & Roast Pork) - was a bit turned off by seeing them put this in the microwave before bringing it to the table. But it tasted good and the skins were still crispy so I guess it wasn't too bad.\n\nPan Fried Seafood Chow Mein- our favorite dish here. My BF is a sucker for this dish anywhere we go and it did not disappoint. Noodles were crispy and gravy was pretty tasty. \n\nBeef and Egg Sauce over Rice- This was a bit of a disappointment for me. It tasted very bland. Also, the rice was not jasmine rice which made it a bigger let down. (I hate when Chinese places use cheap rice, it ruins the whole dinner for me.)\n\nGreen Beans w Minced Pork- I love sauteed green beans at Chinese restaurants. This was okay. A little too salty for my liking. It would be perfect to eat with rice and yet again, if only there were nice and fluffy jasmine rice to accompany this dish. It would have made it better. \n\nIt wasn't an awful meal, but it was nothing remarkable either. There were some dishes I did enjoy (bbq plate and crispy chow mein). But I can find better variations of these dishes elsewhere. \n\nPortions are plenty, we had sooo much leftovers. And for 4 dishes it cost us a bit over $30 which was definitely a steal.
3 ||| This is a very small shop.  The variety is limited.  But if you want German food this is one of the few options around.  They have seasoning packets for various dishes, plus some \"raw\" ingredients (like dried spaetzle, sauerkraut, etc).  A lot of that is imported from Germany.  And then they have their meat case with various German cold-cuts and sausages available.  I'm not sure where those are made.\n\nWhen we were there a German lady (speaking German) was ordering several items.  She apparently comes here all the time.  She gave us some advice on things to try.  So far we are liking most of what we bought.\n\nBe warned...cash or check only!  No credit or debit.  I had to deduct a star for that because cash is extremely inconvenient, and a lot of people don't carry much.  Also the hours on the sign at their door are wrong.  They closed at 5pm on Saturday, not 6pm.\n\nI plan to return from time to time to pick up some specialty items.
2 ||| Let me start with, I love Souper Salad, being going to them for at least 16 yrs... the problem I have it's with this location by Metro Mall... seriously dirty, the floors, the tables...the booth, nasty.  I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like.  I just can't do this place ever again.  Either the people there just don't care about cleaness because is still a good price, or they just as nasty.  This Souper Salad needs help bad --- remodeling, cleaning and nice people to work, cause the waitress we got was either not happy to be there or plainly just a b - i - t %&^^ you get my point.
0 ||| I've been to many Ulta's and this one was by far the worst I've ever been to. The place was so unorganized they didn't have many products that I was looking for and when I asked one of the employees she told me they had been out for a month and wasn't able to tell me when they would be getting new shipment in. The employee didn't seem to know where anything was either . They mostly were all chit chatting instead of helping customers. I definitely won't be going back to this Ulta.
1 ||| Its apparent to me that US Airways has given-up being a normal USA airlline (a damn low standard!).  \n\nI recently flew first class on four long legs (4-5 hours each): Boston -to-PHX-to-Kawaii and return.  Staff was nice enough, but cabin, seats, food, beverages, etc all substandard.\n  \nAs if to illustrate how poor US Airways is now; upon my return home from Kawaii, I had to jump a short. 2-hour AA flight to Chicago.  Also in First Class.  The flight attendant greeted me at my seat by name (US Airways doesn't because a personal greeting costs...nada).  My drinks came in glass, not US AIr's fine First Class plastic.
0 ||| Didn't live up to my expectations at all.  Waste of time and money.  Sloooooow service.
1 ||| Friday1/4/13  5PM... wait staff is ALWAYS overwhelmed when ever we come here.  There was not wait to be seated but the wait and kitchen staff are like chickens with their heads cut off.\n\nWe sat for 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks and the waiter quickly ran off before we could get our appetizers order placed... He showed up 10 minutes later with our wine and then it took another 20 minutes to get the appetizers without one (Pan Shrimp) with the excuse that the fryer is all backed up (remember it's only 5 PM on Fri). \n\nThe Salmon Sashimi was NOT good. While there was a huge amount It was not Sashimi quality ... in fact, it was almost white in color, bland and hard to describe texture.... more Wasabi helped hide it so I could choke it down. If I want the kind of raw salmon, I can get it at the super market.  \n\nThe fried calamari was tough as was the calamari in the Iron Pot Nabeyaki Udon seafood (as usual, the last time we though it was the exception but apparently, its the rule here). I can't remember when I have ever left fried calamari on my plate. I simply couldn't continue to chew this stuff. \n\nIron Pot Nabeyaki Udon seafood was tasty but the amount of actual seafood was dramatically smaller then past visits. They claim shrimp, scallops, calamari, clams fish and vegetables but no shrimp, fish or vegetables were present. One piece of calamari was so big, tough and chewy that I couldn't eat it... not sure what part of the squid that was from.  When I commented to the waiter asking what the deal was with the calmari that is was like shoe leather, he said he didn't know and ran off (with the 1/2 eaten plate of Calamari.\n\nThe panko shrimp was very good as was the chicken parm my dinner companion ordered (what a contrast to Asian menu items). Perhaps he was onto something.\n\nI have eaten here a number of times and the same problems seem to be on going.  I will avoid in the future or at least these menu items.
1 ||| It was kinda' busy for a Saturday night.  They seemed understaffed and our food took forever.  I can't really say that I'll be in a hurry to go back.  The meat loaf was rubbery but I have to say the Chicken Pot Pie soup was tasty.  It's too bad to see a business so disorganized.
3 ||| Good food for the price with excellent atmosphere and staff
0 ||| Driver left people outside of bus, in 100-degree heat, saying he was only dropping off. Then he walked in hotel, came back 20 minutes later with icy drink, now we could board. Very nasty to me when I couldn't immediately find my little paper voucher...he spoke to the other passengers on bus announcing that I was slowing down their airport arrival. This company apparently allows total jerks to drive for them.\n\nWould have been better value to take cab.....or just pay cash to shuttle that is already in front of hotel and ready to go. Waiting for 20+ minutes in Las Vegas heat, and having to track one more document(voucher) is crazy. Never again.
1 ||| I don't get it. I ordered a couple of slices of veggie pizza. It was loaded with fresh veggies and I love that, but the overall taste of the pizza was just OK. This pizza must be eaten immediately, the leftover slice 2 hours later made me wanna cry. I only ate half of it and sadly threw it out! I spent way to much money for bad pizza.
4 ||| I came in after searching on Yelp for a decent Hawaiian restaurant near my office. Looking for a restaurant that compares to Island Sushi is difficult in Las Vegas, so I looked for a four plus star restaurant. The restaurant is compact with wooden tables, wooden floor, and little room to move in. I started thinking that maybe I should go to Diamond China for their delicious steamed fish. I got a menu to order take out... Holy!!! Korean food?! Great! I am tempted to order here now being a fellow Korean.\n\nI got the spicy chick (Korean style) with the hopes that it compares with my mother's. Brown rice added. The server came and gave me boiled peanuts and water as I waited for my order. This is the first restaurant in Las Vegas that I have been to with a boiled peanut appetizer. Amazing!!! So far, so good.\n\nKorean spicy chicken is usually only good if the bone(s) are still attached to the chicken. I took some boiled peanuts to go along with some sriracha sauce to mix with the brown rice. The chicken is delicious although it came in chopped thigh pieces (no bones). I was quite amazed at the flavor of the dish. The take out order came with kimchi (kimchi is good, but better at Mr. Tofu) and macaroni salad as well. I think I could have gotten more chicken pieces, but it was definitely worth a try.\n\nI am excited to check out the soon dubu as it will be compared to Mr. Tofu.
0 ||| I went to Kierland Mall in hopes to dine at Ocean Club, only to find a 1 hour 50 minute wait, next stop North, who had a 45 minute wait. By chance I walked over to Zinc where I was seated immediately! I should have know there was a reason and I found out very soon.\n\nAlthough the place was half empty, the manager insisted our party of 2 sit at a tiny table that was soon over- crowded with just a bread basket and a bottle of wine. Where were they going to put the food?\nWell after they spilled a glass of wine on the both of us while trying to set down our appetizer, I got up and moved us to one of the larger empty tables. The bus staff (who was excellent) help us gracefully make the move. The manager (Ben)  however, still tried to hassle us even though the place was now even emptier than when we first arrived. In spite of all this, our barely-existent waiter took our order after I had to send for him twice. He was not helpful at all in explaining any dishes, and could not make any recommendations when asked for suggestions. He was very bothered by the whole process and seemed more interested in talking to his manager between ever course. I continually had to keep asking for him to keep the dinier moving. When the check came, I caught two mistakes, he over-charged us for a bottle of wine I didn't order and added an appetizer that was supposed to be for someone elses bill. The prices are high enough, there is no need to pad the bill, but double-check it for sure.\n\n The food was outstanding! The best short ribs I've ever eaten and I order it everywhere I can. Too bad the dining experience ruined the night. Obviously, the word must be out. High prices, very dim lights (always makes me suspicious about what they are trying to hide) and horrible service explains why there is always a table available. Do yourself a favor, wait the hour elsewhere, it will be better than ruining your night.
0 ||| I decided to go with AZ Exterminating when a door to door salesman for the company was coming around my neighborhood and offering a discounted promotion for the winter months (bugs are barely out) I signed up for the quarterly  service as the guy recommended because and I quote \"you wont need more than that our chemical treats and remains active for longer than that. Since I signed up there have been several scheduling issues, the tech not showing up during the time frame he was supposed to etc. As long as he came that was not that big of a deal to me, I just want to the spiders gone. Well we got sprayed last time in April around the first of the month of so, I noticed recently there have been huge spiders all over the patio and even some in the house. So I called them yesterday and wanted to have them come out (they have a worry free guarantee if the bugs come back before the next spray so will they to take care of the problem) I spoke to the lady at the office on the phone and she said no problem at all she would have the tech give me a call to schedule when the best time to come out would be. About an hour later the tech called to schedule, I was so impressed when he said he could be out the next day between 730am and 8am. YAY the bug guy is coming to take all the bugs away. Well this morning (next day) I got up at about 7am and waited for him to show. I about 8:15am no bug guy (Frank is his name) so I send Frank a text asking if he is coming or running later. No response. At 9am I get a call from a lady by the name of Cricket telling me I have to upgrade to the bi monthly service in order to have him come back out because the chemical breaks down after 60 days. Are they aware a quarterly set up is 3 months, no 2?!? I said Cricket your tech was supposed to be here an hour and a half ago and you are calling to tell me that he's not only NOT coming, that in order to even get him out here at all I have to upgrade to have you come out every 2 months instead of 2 because the guy that sold me your business promotion last winter LIED to me when he said it would last more than 90 days? She had a little giggle and said well you must have been misinformed, we only offer the bug free guarantee if you are on the bi monthly billing cycle because we know the chemical wont last longer than that. BUT they are running a promotion right now so its only 75 instead of 90. SO UNPROFESSIONAL. I told them to cancel my service immediately and I would find a company that truly understands communication and customer service. If the tech should have never scheduled the service in the first place you should not have had him give me a call. GET IT TOGETHER. I will definitely be giving the manager Chris a call on Monday to find out what happened and how I was so misinformed. FIND A BETTER BUG GUY, these guys do not know what they are doing.
0 ||| I used a groupon and placed a call in order. Got there and they didn't put the bread in with the pasta.  Waited for that. Then  I realized they didn't put the meatballs in the pasta. Waited again. Finally after 1 hr and 10 minutes it was done. Had my kids with me too. Unacceptable service! This is how restaurants lose customers. They didn't offer to deduct anything off the bill for screwing up the order either.
2 ||| Never have gotten a good deal with these guys. Which is sad, I like their thin crust pizzas with all the meats, but this one seems to be way overpriced, so when that happens I search elsewhere, forget they screwed me, end up over in their parking lot and see their sign. My stomach over rides my brain and says 'thin crust' and i place an order (giving them another chance) nope... Screwed again, shame on me as I put my wallet in my pocket and now review this place as I wait. First as a warning for you my friends, but mostly as a reminder for myself that I'm an idiot for trying them again
4 ||| I've been back to try the Vietnamese BBQ and all I can say is daaaammnn Geeenaa!\n\nWhen the little grill and tons of plates of \"stuff\" arrived at my table, I was completely lost.  I looked around at the smiling faces of successful grillers, and thought, \"I want to be just like that guy, only without the mustache.\"  I had to ask my server for instructions.\n\nI'm going to break it down for you so you're prepared to get crazy with your dinner:\n\nYou will get a plate of beef and shrimp, (order this one, both proteins were great) lettuce, mint, limes, onions, and jalapenos, (like with pho) some peanut sauce and some fish sauce for dipping, a bowl of hot water, and finally, little clear pieces of paper (rice wrappers)\n\nHere's what you do:\n\n1)  Squeeze some lime on your meats, because errrthing's better with lime.\n2)  Dip your meats in the oil which is in the little reservoir around the grill, then place on the grill, cook to your liking.\n3) Dip rice wrappers in hot water to reconstitute them, then lay on your plate.  \n4) Fill wrapper with lettuce, mint, jalapenos, carrots\n5)  Put freshly cooked meat in wrapper.\n6) Wrap it up like a burrito\n7)  Enjoy the HELL out of that delicious little thang!\n\n\nI was with some friends, and we thought it was hilarious to call these things \"tacos.\"  We had a few drinks, so I'm sure it wasn't funny at all, but let's go ahead and just roll with it. \n\nEven though we left the table an absolute mess, the food was great and the experience was fun.  We'll definitely be back soon my Vietnamese friends!
4 ||| I met a friend for here for cocktails a couple of weeks ago.\n\nWhen I got home and answered the query \"where did you go for drinks?\", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(\n\nBecause, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)\n\nYou know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!\n\nT Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say \"everything is good\" when you ask for their recommendations:)\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)\n\nI have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)\n\nI was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)\n\nWe had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)\n\nOnion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)\n\nCarin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:) \n\nI know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)\n\nI had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)\n\nThey also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)\n\nWe had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)\n\nI tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)\n\nTime really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)\n\nBut such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire \"do you love everything?\":)\n\nIt was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!\n\nBut we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)
2 ||| Just a standard target. Nothing special.
4 ||| = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = =\n\nThere's an old Chinese proverb:  \"Once bitten, twice shy.\"  This place was so awful when I was here in January '09 that it took me over 4 1/2 years to get up the nerve to try it again!  I'm happy to report that things were better here this time:\n\nSOME POSITIVES:\n\n*  Both the dining room and the men's restroom looked very clean!\n\n*  The ambiance (lighting, sound (soft Chinese music playing), room temperature and booth comfort were all good.  The dining room furnishings are arranged more attractively now than they were in '09, & it was a peaceful atmosphere overall.  (There were 5 other customers dining.)\n\n*  My \"hot tea\" was hot this time, & it's free with the Buffet!\n\n*  The Egg Flower Soup was ok & much better than last time!\n\n*  All the food temperatures were right & I liked the taste of most of it.\n\n\nOK, A FEW CAVILS:\n\n*  The sign outside says $5.99 but I was charged $6.55 total.  It should have been $6.49 at the current tax rate of 8.3%, so right now she's charging $6.05 plus tax.\n\n*  One of the main things I always go for at an Oriental Buffet is the fried chicken.  The big legs cooked up here looked great in the tray but mine seemed oily and only marginally cooked enough on the inside.\n\n*  Limited selection of 21 items including the tea.\n\n\nALL IN ALL?\n\nHong Kong here holds it own now against Mike Kwan's (\"infamous\") Golden Coin just 2 miles away.  That's another place that was 1-Star & improved.  The food is good there now but they have a microscopic selection of only 8 items & the bathroom is ucky.\n\nIt IS a pleasure to see a formerly disaster case Buffet like this get BETTER rather than finally closing such as East Buffet downtown, for example.  Did you ever eat there?  OMG!  The last time I was there I was fighting over my food with this big spider.  It was like a horror movie!  The whole scene there was so awful (& I ate there 2 or 3 times!).  Just running back across my Reviews of the place was upsetting enough that I finally deleted them completely.  (Still get goosebumps when I drive by the derelict building!)     :-O\n\nOk, so the daily Lunch Buffet here at Hong Kong Restaurant is $6.05     :-|
3 ||| I'm not typically one to just head out to a bar and have a couple beers with friends. I'd most likely pick one of Charlotte's premier breweries or even a passable taproom/pub over any bar/watering hole in town. Buuuuuut....throw in a couple of ping pong tables and I'm hooked. I'll hold a paddle and slam backhands all night long, regardless of where it is, with a grin from ear to ear. Heck, if there were a pingpong table at my wife's nail salon I'd go every time. \n\nThomas Street is a great dive-y bar to meet up with some friends for some sub-par grub and plenty of foamy brews. I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed a good greaser or hoagie. Hey Oh, heartburn! It's always worth it, though, isn't it? \n\nBest part about this joint is the back patio. Not much to shake a stick at in the winter time or if the sun isn't shining on a Saturday afternoon, but when it's right, this place is the crown jewel of hangouts on Thomas Ave. Cornhole, plenty of bench seats, tables, draughts outside, and many a lively 20-something enjoying it all the same. Again, ping pong tables? Count me in. Note: it can be rather difficult to nudge your way in line to grab a game. Kindly ask bro-ho du jour for next game and you should be good. \n\nThomas Street Tavern is an easy go-to if you're in the Plaza area. A mix of entertainment and space make easy for a revisit.
2 ||| Nothing special. If you looking for a place to sleep, shower and store ya luggage then this is the place. It rent for $27 a night for a reason and please expect $27 customer service as well. This is a smoking hotel so be prepared to enter your room to the smell of cig smoke covered with carpet and air freshener. Casino is small, limited toiletries in your room and they have a so call balcony but it's 15\" wide, I was scared to go out there. The restaurant is a typical Hooters joint. You would expect drop dead gorgeous girls because it's Vegas right? NOPE, regular ole plain Janes. Overall, not my first pick for a return trip.
1 ||| Left me waiting, no show! I called after over 30 minutes and they said no one is in the area or on the way! Not even a phone call to give me a heads up, could've been waiting there and missed my flight!
4 ||| I cannot live without Lo-Lo's.  It is INSANE.  Juicy, juicy chicken, crispy waffles....mind blowing.  I alternate between the Betty Boop and the Tre Tre.  I actually prefer their dark meat as I find it tastier.  Either way though, you can't go wrong.  Skip the Scottsdale location and go to the OG place on Yuma.  Oh..and get the sweet tea! Tooth rot in a jar, but so good!
3 ||| This was our first visit and was pleasantly surprised.  We were greeted and seated immediately, even though we were early for our reservation. I also downloaded the Yelp app to my phone and it offered a free appetizer at check-in.   Wings and Onion Rings combo.  Yum!  Enough to satisfy 2 adults and 2 kids. \n\nI got the Spaghetti with Marinara and added chicken which was grilled.  Very delicious.  Husband got Baked Ziti.  Tasted great as well.  Son ordered the kids pepperoni pizza.  It was big enough to share with his younger brother.  \n\nI was very satisfied with the portion sizes.  It wasn't too much or too little.  We had just enough room for the Spumookie, which was a cookie with ice cream on top.  That I would give 4 stars to only because I recently had the Pizookie at Oreganos and that was just a little bit better. \nStill, overall our bill was about $35 and for the around of food, and the quality, was great value.  It's rare to get that for a family of four.  \n\nOur waitress was new, but she was nice,  smiled a lot, helpful with the menu (I am one of those who asks a million questions), and more importantly never let our drinks run out.  As soon as it hit 1/4 full, we got a refill.   That's very rare nowadays!     Alice was attentive, friendly, and that experience (along with food) will make sure we definitely come back very soon.  \n\nWe went to the 83rd and Bell location.
2 ||| Used to be a classic. However, it's come under new ownership and everything has suffered across the board. Average service, below average food and terrible atmosphere.\n\nNeeds a shot in the arm because it'd be a shame to see a classic Wisconsin supper club disappear.
4 ||| We were looking for masks for a mascarade party and the girl at the front desk went out of her way to pull old ones from the back. Excellent customer service!
2 ||| They have a nice place here, especially in the winter when it is nice to warm up by the fireplace which is in the center of the room.\nBut they fall down on the food and cleanliness.   \nTheir bathroom is not terrible but not clean either and small.\nTheir salad bar is small and I have gotten spoiled food in my salad.\nTheir pizza is usually good but I have gotten slices that are way overloaded with grease.  I mean I used to take my napkin and soak off the grease before I took a bit.  Sometimes two napkins full of grease.\nYeah, not cool.   \nHaven't been back for some time now due to the food quality issues.
1 ||| I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls.\nToday saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth..........\nI've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again.
0 ||| Horrible experience with this company.  The apartment was filthy upon move-in, loads of things broken.  It took weeks to get the maintenance request filled.  Later in my residency, I had a valuable package stolen from in front of my door.  Instead of referring me to a security person, or even the HOA, they told me \"can't help.\"  Now, with a broken smoke detector they are unwilling to assist as well, as they \"don't replace batteries\" - however the ceiling is 12-feet and I do not own a ladder.  \n\nI'm not really sure why I'm paying this company at all at this point.  They are completely unhelpful and I cannot express how thankful I am that I only signed a 9-month lease.
1 ||| Irritating beeping behind the line for at least 3 minutes while we waited 6 minutes to get our coffee
2 ||| Bed, Bath and Beyond is cool.  It's one of those places you can walk in and say \"I want that\" about a hundred times, and then as you're walking through the store you realize just how useless the stuff you're carrying really is.\n\nBy the time you make it to the register, you may have absolutely nothing that you need.  That's why they keep sending out those discount coupons in the mail.  But it sure is a lot of neat stuff to look at as you walk through the store.
0 ||| The owner is a first class grump and the place is a mess. Minimum price seems to be $4.00 no matter what the condition of the book. Jane Addams books over on Neil St in Champaign is a much better experience all round.
4 ||| I was honestly a little nervous to stay here based on previous reviews, but apparently whatever remodeling issues they had have been taken care of. We were allowed to check in early (thank goodness, it was 110 outside) and our room was gorgeous. Front desk staff was wonderful.  Upgraded to a balcony room and was sooooo worth it! Didn't try the spinning restaurant but the Einstein Bagel staff was very friendly in the early morning hours.  Perfect place to stay in downtown Phoenix.
3 ||| The dolly steamboat is very nice and relaxing. The ride is a bit long but it is very nice. The crew of the boat is extremely nice and try to help you see things. My only complaint is that I would of like a little more history of the place then what was said.
4 ||| Had to go get a new pair of glasses. They were so helpful when it came to picking out a style that looked good... or at least I was comfortable wearing in public. I was very happy with the personal attention I received both when picking out my glasses and when I got them back a week or so later. \n\nThe prices aren't cheap, but neither are the glasses. Gucci, Coach, Oakley... don't expect your insurance to cover everything, but then again my insurance wont cover Costco's prices 100%. (and I have very good insurance)\n\nI also like that if you buy your contacts through them they will give you free solution.\n\nMainly, I just liked the fact that it seemed like they cared about their customer. I will be back because of the great customer service.
1 ||| i came here the first time when i first moved to the Biltmore and was stoked i had one of these next to my place. \n\ni got the impression from the people that work there that I'm at a car dealership. lol they try and upsell you everything they can think of. NO SIR i just want my car washed. i needed up falling for it and ended up paying $100 to have my car detailed. and to be honest it wasn't worth. yes my car came out clean but not what i was expecting for dropping $100 bucks! they left water spots, they DID NOT vacuum my truck. i had to tell them to when i looked at my car, so just inspect your ride before you hand the dude a nice lil tip. there is a guy that works in the auto service department and he hooks me up whenever i want to get my car serviced and throughs in free car washes every time i go there, which i can't complain. but get it together guys! you have high end cars getting washed there day after day. you would think it would be a little better in a area like this.
4 ||| Great!  My friends told me about this place a long time ago, but I just hadn't had the time to check it out. I'm glad I finally did, the service was great I was taken care of in a timely manner and my full set was done in what I felt was very timely. I will definitely be coming back. THANK YOU!
4 ||| I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. \n\nPrior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.\n\nNow let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has \"Chicken & Waffles\" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.\n\nCheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...\n\nI'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.\n\nDamn.
0 ||| This place is terrible. We walked in and the hostess didn't bother to greet us, she just looked up and said 3 and walked us to a table. I was never asked if  I wanted a  drink. 2 of us went to grab something from the car and while we were gone the waiter took the other member of our parties order. When we came back we waited and finally had to flag  down the waiter. The menu had no descriptions of the entrees and the waiter was not helpful in explaining anything. The dishes are WAY over prices and the don't come with veggies or rice. My food left much to be desired. The customer service was awful the staff as unhelpful, un-attentive, and rude. I won't be back.
4 ||| Kohls is an amazing store to get lost in, if you have time. You can find so much variety for your wardrobe at great prices. The people who work here are friendly and helpful. There clearance is expensive but I feel that maybe more of a marketing scheme to make you feel good about the price. Either way I love this place
3 ||| We had some computer bugs at our restaurant. Granite was all over it. Wonderful speedy service.
2 ||| Tried Abuelo's last night with some friends. Ambience and decor are lovely.\n\nHad Grandieza frozen margarita ($5!) that was solid and refreshing! It took me 1.5 hours to polish off due to its size and brain freeze side effect.\n\nHuge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.\n\nOrdered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!\n\nA friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her \"Well, lemme see what I can do\". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh\n\nNo add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.\n\nI won't be back for a full meal, but wld entertain just having their papas and a margarita at the bar.
4 ||| Great customer service. amazing low prices. and great selection
2 ||| You are what you eat -- Mexican, Italian, Middle Eastern, New American, or what have you. As the product of Lebanese parentage, hummus runs through my veins, but as a citizen of the southwestern United States, Mexican cuisine is just as much a part of my identity.\n\nBelieve me when I say, then, that Mi Pueblo delivers the goods. There's no pretension in the food here, no misguided attempt to take time-tested dishes and give them a New American flair. The carne asada burrito (which itself is little more than marinated beef wrapped in a tortilla) comes with a side of rice. The fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas, meat, onions and peppers. What more do you need?\n\nMy family ate at Mi Pueblo for lunch. The restaurant was criminally vacant. The decor was, well, who cares? Dress it up with sombreros and guitars, pipe mariachi music through the speakers -- it doesn't really matter. The food is the thing. If that sucks, no amount of ambience is going to persuade me to enjoy myself. And the food is good. \n\nThe burritos will only be conquered by those with the most voracious of appetites. The chicken tacos are compact, crispy and served with a jalapeno sauce that has to be blended with crack. I won't hear otherwise. The fajitas get the job done -- they aren't really my thing. Our server was pleasant, helpful and gave me my Negra Modelo with two lime wedges and a freezing cold, salt-rimmed glass.\n\nLook, I'm a man of simple pleasures. I like dark Mexican beer, tasty burritos and good service. Mi Pueblo has all of these things. When it comes to Mexican food in the Valley, we have an embarassment of riches. The hit to miss ratio tends to swing in favor of the misses. You could easily do a lot worse than Mi Pueblo, so do yourself a favor and stop in.
2 ||| 9 times out 10 this place usually gets the 4-5 star mark on their chicken pho. This was probably the 10th. Really dissapointed on a recent trip.\n\nChicken Pho - Usually I order this because the beef pho is lukewarm at this place due to the high volume (which isn't really an excuse because Pho Saigon 8 does pretty big numbers as well, and their pho is always piping hot.) Not only was their soup lukewarm as well, but the chicken was overcooked. Sigh. Don't even want to think about it. Will give them another chance but kinda on the edge right now. lol
0 ||| Why would anyone pay money for food like this?
2 ||| Nice atmosphere but not so nice hot chocolate. I can be a food/drink purist sometimes and I didn't like them using chocolate sauce for my drink. Eww.
4 ||| I took my fianc\u00e9 here last Friday night and it was amazing!!  The food and the drinks were superb!  The menu is diverse and the drinks are delicious.  We enjoyed ourselves very much.
2 ||| My Fiance ordered here late last night because it was the only local place that would deliver. \n\nWhat we sampled: \nGeneral Tso's Chicken (strange, the sauce tasted weird and it wasn't crispy at all.  We left it untouched and tossed it)\nPork Fried Rice (very oily with no vegetables, just a greasy mess only ate two bites before we threw it out)\nSingapore Mei Fun (one of the best take out versions we ever had)\nCrab Rangoon (decent, but not crispy)\nEgg Rolls (decent)\nSteamed Dumplings (gross)\nSpare Ribs (another great version)\n\nOverall if we needed another late night meal we might order from here again, but probably not.
0 ||| My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.  \n\nWhen we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there. \n\nI clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time!
2 ||| Food was good, service was ok.  Nothing bad to write about, but nothing outstanding either.  Decently priced and tasty.
2 ||| I have been going to this place for years. The bread is always good, as is the pesto.\n\nSadly, the food has gone downhill. Over our past several visits, we had cold in the middle pizza, food waaay to salty only to come back with absolutly no taste at all when the waiter was called over, food too greasy (even for italian standards), food tasting like it has been sitting for quite some time, luke warm soup....this all breaks my heart. This place used to be a delicious splurge I looked forward to. The last time we visited which was a few months back, I left feeling completely ill. I want to love this place again, but every visit it just gets worse. \n\n\nWe have always had good service...the staff is attentive, smiling, kind and right on target.
2 ||| The Church Brew Works is one of those places where everyone has been and everyone raves about...but I just do not get it. I guess part of the reason I don't really dig it is because I'm more of a cocktail gal than a beer fan. Aside from the fact that it is a brewery and I'm not really a beer drinker, the food is only so-so. I got a perogie dish with chicken and my friend got salmon. Her salmon was ok and the same goes for my perogie dish. We shared some homemade chips with a beer/cheese dip before our meal. The chips were really good, but the same as any place that serves homemade chips, and the beer/cheese dip tasted like chicken broth. It lacked anything special. The atmosphere is awesome, and it would be such a cool place for a classic Pittsburgh rehearsal dinner or similar event...but the food is just ... eh. The atmosphere is the only redeeming quality that I can find. \n\nAlso, our waitress was (I can't find a nice way to say this...I'm sorry) kind of annoying. She called us both \"Hun\" and \"Sweetheart\" the ENTIRE evening. It felt like those words are a verbal tic of hers...Every other word was Hun or Sweetheart. Her nails had been painted weeks ago...because there was a horrid spot of nearly gone green nail polish on every nail. It only takes a minute to remove nail polish, and when working in an industry that involves putting your hands in front of people it is worth either repainting them, or leaving them clean. The \"I painted my nails a month ago and haven't gotten around to repainting them or removing the polish\" look is NOT ok. Ok...I'm being mean. I'm sorry...but both my friend and I noticed her nails and her verbal tic, and we were both annoyed by both. \n\nAll in all, it's somewhere that all Pittsburghers have to go at least once to see the awesome building, but don't have high expectations...it's just ok.
4 ||| Fabulous, just fabulous. Service is spectacular and food is beyond amazing. The wait was awhile, maybe half an hour or so but totally worth it. The breakfast burrito, salmon hash and potato and zucchini pancakes are delectable.
1 ||| Didn't know Party City also sold costumes.  (I've only visited one a couple of times in VA when sister needed balloons for her kids' parties.)  While the huge displays initially seemed impressive, they quickly revealed that the costumes sold here were of very low-quality.  Faced w/ two choices of spending $60+ on a costume here, or going to a party w/out, I'll choose the latter.  \n\nBetter still, I'd give my sister $60 and see what she can come up w/!  (She's made a few clever ones for under $15!)\n\nCustomer service was also very bad.  The adult costumes I tried had run out of size extra-small and small, and the medium I was offered was too big.  When I asked if there were equivalent styles in the children's section to try, I was told that was a good idea and I should go over there and have a look.  The sales rep could've at least offered to check.  Any chance of my giving in and spending $50+ plus tax on cheap pieces of crap flew out the window when those words came flying out of her mouth!  (That's $50 plus tax on a costume for which accessories would still have to be purchased to complete the look.  Oh, think of how many potential purchases lost bec. of lousy customer service offered here?)\n\nThe second star was for the info given by the cashier to a friend who bought a cape that any item returned within seven days of purchase would be returnable for the amount paid.  If only I would be caught wearing their costumes in the first place would this info be of use!\n\n(BTW, my friend returned said cape.  Nice!)
4 ||| Awesome restaurant.  I have been going to Sacks for over 15 years and am never dissapointed.  The staff is friendly, the specials fantastic and the bread selection/quality is always great. The tea is always good, and fresh. Two thumbs up.  I probably eat at Sacks at least 2 x a week!
2 ||| Over priced for mediocre service.
2 ||| I'm probably the worst person to review strip clubs since I'm crap at going to them. I don't know what to do and I feel awkward just being there. I also have a \"thing\" about paying people to touch me. I don't go to the doctor unless it's absolutely necessary, I cut my own hair, and I've never even had a massage (of any kind). Still, somehow I've managed to go to a ton of these clubs and occasionally I've had a good time.\n\nThis place came highly recommended by my girlfriend who swears by it... at lunchtime... during the week. I've only gone at night and have yet to have a good time here. It's got a great stage and it's a huge club and you would think it's one of the most professional looking places in the Valley. The problem is, every time I've gone here I've either been completely ignored or had lousy lap dances. \n\nExample - I got a dance from this adorable (and young) girl who snapped her gum and lip-synced to the R&B song that was playing as she hopped up and down on my lap. It was more annoying than sexy and I wanted her to get off me and die - instead, after she was done I made her give my girlfriend the same shitty lapdance (and she hated it as well) because I'm evil and that's the most joy I typically get out of strip clubs.\n\nMaybe I need to go with a large group and flash a bunch of cash. Maybe that's how you're supposed to roll at a strip club - go large - spend lots of money - go VIP - etc... I just don't know if I want to take it that far. Anyway - I think this club has potential and I'm going to assume I've just been on off nights (all 3 times I've gone).
2 ||| I am not sure why people like this place.  I have tried several locations and have dis-liked them all.  If I don't like a place I don't usually give it a second chance but  because I like to support local businesses and so many people rave about Macayo's I did try several locations.  Everyone says the one off of Mill Ave is good.  But I have wasted enough money at their restaurants.  It boggles my mind how a chain of such low quality can exist.  Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with \"o's\" is better than this place.  \n\nThe reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.\n\nThe only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid.
4 ||| Cool little pub in the SouthEnd area with a decent outdoor area. Stopped in a couple weeks ago for some brews and food. Had the pimento cheeseburger with fries. It had a good grilled flavor but overall it was just another burger, nothing too special. The fries were tasty. I really liked the $3 draft special, Sweetwater 420! You can't beat that price!! The service is friendly. Overall, nice place to hang with some friends, drink a few cold ones and play some cornhole.
3 ||| If you are someone that cooks at home, you might be less impressed with MMR, but even so, there are a few things on their menu that are standouts.\n\nThe turkey meal is really quite good and I like that you can choose the sides that are to your liking.  The chicken and dumpling soup is thick and creamy (and even a little addictive).  The first time that I saw it as one of the daily offerings, I asked what the server thought it was sort of funny when she told me that people will call about the daily selections and come in when this one is offered... now I am one of those people. During strawberry season, you cannot leave without having a slice of the strawberry pie. It is piled with fresh berries and covered in a mountain of freshly whipped cream.\n\nPortions are large, so if you want pie consider taking a slice (1/4 of a pie) home with you.  The crust isn't the most tender, but the flavor is good and they generally have at least six flavors to choose from. Fruit fillings are made from scratch, so you are best off choosing something that is in season.  Hint: if you are going to buy two slices, it is actually just as cheap to get a whole pie.\n\nI really do like this place for some of the more exceptional choices, the fact that they have a relatively extensive menu, and that they deliver.\n\nUpping their rating to 4 stars.  :)
3 ||| This place isn't the Wynn, but it's also pretty decent for the money you'd be spending to stay here.\n\nThere are enough choices for food to get along well.  Subway and Starbucks, but also Chinese, Italian, room service, etc.\n\nAs for gaming, you have plenty of options, and good price minimums.\n\nEntertainment is why they didn't get 5 stars.  Not much to do besides gamble in my opinion.  The sportsbook is older, and the live shows aren't great.
0 ||| The food is good if you can get past seeing the small roaches running across the floor. I just find it hard to down my meal with small sewer roaches running across the floor.\nThe first time I went there it was take out, so I did not notice the roaches. The second time I ate there after purchasing the yelp coupon. It was then that I noticed the place has small roach problem. Yuck........
3 ||| What a perfect location for Nu Towne Saloon. Way the hell out on Van Buren and 50th something or other street. Right next to a Honey Bear's. And then. That's it. Seriously. On this creepy, weird, strike up the Deliverance theme song, strip of Van Buren sits a gay honky tonk bar. Where, perhaps, \"squeal like a pig\" is not so frowned upon. It's basically a large shed plastered with neon beer signs, a few rainbow flags thrown in and, on Sundays, a great mixed, mostly gay crowd, all revved up for the beer bust. Great burgers and dogs, grilled right there on the patio. Friendly bartenders and beer, beer, beer and more beer. Obligatory pool tables and dart boards for those who need a break from cruisin and there's even a dance floor the size of a cocktail napkin for those who dare to make the first move. Nu Towne is my kinda town.
2 ||| PF Chang I love your decor, and your complimentary valet! Your service is pretty nice as well, unintrusive, informative, and friendly. However your food seems to be lacking something for me, and the prices aren't that cool either.\n\nWhen we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section. It's such a nice restaurant, but for the quality of food you get for the price it's woefully lacking. I guess what you're really paying for is location and service because both are top notch. We ordered a bunch of menu items and I seriously can't remember my meal there. Stuff tends to be either too salty or too bland, and tastes pretty much the same.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I'll be back. When I'm in the mood for some americanized Chinese I think I'll just stick to the takeout place for tastier food at half the price.
0 ||| HOTEL. STAFF. CROWD.\n\nPurchased a room, bought bottle service, and gave more than enough money away to this place - only to be pushed out the hotel/club by some chump bouncer (with all my money, I.D., & personal belongings still in my room)  because I had taken the stairwell and came in from the back patio. Not having any idea, since I had only been there for less than an hour, apparently the patio was closed off for matienence. As I scream at the guy, waving my hotel key around, asking him what was going on over the loud music, he merely pushed me out the hotel and had me wait for another staff member to tell me it was okay to go back inside - NO SHIT! \n\nStay far away from this place. Careless drunk fools who wouldn't give a damn if they just knocked your $10 drink out of your hand. And very rude staff who refuse to listen or be apologetic.
2 ||| Some girl I know said she went to China Chili and it was the best Chinese food she's ever had. After she told me that I went to China Chili the next day. The menu is standard for a Chinese restaurant nothing special. We ordered some beef dish for our meal and a side of chow mein. The beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland. I do not understand why people love China Chili. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!
4 ||| Came here per friends' recommendation since I was on a business trip in Decatur, which is 30 min away from Champaign. I had my doubts at first because who would have thought any food could would be this good in a small college town. Boy was I in for a treat. \n\nStrawberry shortcake snowstorm was my choice based on my friend's yelp review and it was AMAZING. The portion for was quite large for a small cup too. DEFINITELY going to come back again in my future trips.
3 ||| Most dishes on the menu are American style Chinese food. Not a bad choice if you just want to have a quick bite at lunch time. I felt that the food there is a little pricier than it should be. Aside from these I do recommend their basil chicken, which is a traditional Taiwanese dish.
2 ||| Stopped here for early dinner on the way back home from a trip.\nI had the Jambalaya and hubby had some chicken that comes with a brown sauce, brown rice and black beans. \n\nEverything was OK, just the brown rice was very plain and my pasta was a little tough... \nI like their flavored iced tea, and the bread (molasses bread?)
3 ||| I'm sure it's a lot smaller than LAX yet it seems more complicated to navigate. As soon as I got to the airport around 9pm all the shops were closed. When I returned for my return flight around 6 or so, all the shops with snacks were closed. Only thing open was fast food and fancy restaurants. I just wanted BBQ chips and a soda. Oh well. \n\nOther than that, it's fairly clean. No sirens going off like at LAX (will review later). I asked for directions and the employees were helpful. Can't complain.
4 ||| My husband and I have decided that this place is our home away from home. We arrive during Happy Hour, enjoy the libations, and the company of others sitting at the bar. We usually end up eating our dinner in the bar area since we enjoy visiting with the \"regulars\". The manager, Cammie is wonderful as well as the owner Paolo.  We have NEVER had a bad meal here and as far as we are concerned, it's the BEST Italian food in town. (we are both Italian Americans and we know good Italian food!)
0 ||| Ugh ugh ugh! Man, for being such a great chain for wings, this place STUNK! The dressing and dip is no longer freshly made, but Ken's best ranch. Not ok. It was just a disappointment.
3 ||| Cute place, but the food was horrible!!  Steak was burnt!!  Who burns  a seak at a steak house?  The twice baked was harder than a rock!!   IF they had better food this place would be amazing! Hopefully they get it together .
2 ||| No longer in business or at least at fiesta mall and phone number has been disconnected
4 ||| They get top stars just for making sure we knew they weren't putting the rush on us!\nSo we get there kinda late on Sunday evening,no worries...\nWe're treated very well,staff warm and genuine.\nWe both opt for different types of personal pizza.\nI got the cheeze...Simple,simple,but good and tasty.\nI never knew this place existed and look foward to going back and tryong something else!
2 ||| To many rules. No split checks, no credit cards, no substitutions or additions, no breakfast after 11. Staff is nice, food is average.
0 ||| Bad!!! Worst Chinese food in Pittsburgh!
1 ||| There is no search option for the Wal-Mart Distribution Center located at 58 S. Thornton in Casa Grande so I figured I would post a review here. As a truck driver delivering to this facility it is absolutely a miserable experience. I backed up to the dock at 230 a.m. and the trailer was completely unloaded by 330   a.m. It is now 515 a.m. and I still sit here waiting to be called by receiving to inform me that my paperwork is ready. Truckers drive 11 hours straight to ensure the product is delivered on time, through all sorts of driving conditions and are quite exhausted upon delivery of product. Why is it always a problem to get paperwork done So that a driver can leave to get some rest. And on top of all that, the employees/office staff in receiving are cold and, most of the time, rude to every truck driver they interact with. We aren't bad people and without us you wouldn't have products to stock your store shelves with. We just want to be able to get in, deliver the product, be able to safely leave to find a place to sleep and be on our way all while dealing with friendly employees. Whatever happened to \"Service with a Smile\"?
4 ||| Great Prices, Great Service. Clean Install. Would definitely recommend them to all. Had a new stereo installed with them the other day. Finally a audio company that's not trying to knock you over the head.
1 ||| It was time for an oil change, and I've received coupons advertising Purrfect Auto Service in the past, with an unbelievable price of $9.95.  On this date, I didn't have a coupon, because I've driven past the business in the past, and they advertise the $9.95 price on two sides of their business building.  \n\nI walked into the store, and asked for the $9.95 oil change.  The first thing that the cashier said was that I had to have a coupon for that deal.  I briefly pointed out that the price is ADVERTISED on their building in two places, but it was to no avail.  I must have looked confused and frustrated, because the cashier asked, \"What kind of car do you drive?\" I told him \"Saturn Ion\", and was told \"Oh even with the coupon, we wouldn't do that price for that car.\"  I guess this was supposed to make me feel better.  It didn't. Then, I boldly went to the question that hardly mattered at this point, because I wasn't going to reward these guys for deceptive advertising: \"What does an oil change cost for my car?\"  He said \"$29.95\".  I muttered/stuttered, and headed for the door.\n\nI have no idea what kind of car qualifies for the $9.95 oil change. If you have the time, stop by and find out.  Bring $29.95 plus tax if you actually expect your oil changed.
2 ||| If you're around the area, Saigon Noodles is a safe bet for Pho. Some people love the place, but I'm not the biggest fan. The food is okay; nothing special in my opinion. However, the service is quite fast, and it's a great place for larger groups. The spring rolls are tasty, and they are made in an authentic fashion.\n\nThe portions are large, so you will not be left hungry. There are other places with better Asian-fare in Madison, but there are also places with pretty bad Asian food, so if you don't know where to go for your Vietnamese fix, Saigon Noodles is a good go-to.
3 ||| Love the outdoor area here. They have a good selection of beer and a giant outdoor bar area. They also have a great tasting room inside for when it's cold or rainy. \n\nThe brewery tour is short but interesting (it's not a huge place after all). Their beers are decent, not the best in town, though. They offer seasonals and new brews on occasion.\n\nAs far as beer is concerned, there's much better out there in Madison. The outdoor space, however, is great.
4 ||| Had lunch at my mothers, no not talking bout my moms place, ha had a sandwich with mac salad. It was okay, have had better sandwiches elsewhere, my homie had some chicken wings, they looked and smelled yummy. Saw the ladies across the way order spaghetti, definitely on my to order list when I make it back to mothers.
4 ||| I love their samosa chaat, every time I'm in Vegas I just go here for samosa chaat. It's amazing!
1 ||| Pho is acceptable BUT service is the pits! VEEY RUDE SERVERS and CASHIER! They gave us the impression of hurry and eat and get out of here!
2 ||| Phoenix is not exactly what you would call a 24 hour town, unlike its desert cousin to the northwest.  So late night dining options are somewhat limited.  \n\nToday I went searching for a place to eat breakfast at 3am on a Tuesday.   Being somewhat of a Denny's hater, I thought I'd give Waffle House a shot, since it was the next closest option.  \n\nI have eaten at Waffle House once before in Missouri, while my girlfriend and I were on a Route 66 road trip.  Waffle Houses are *everywhere* in the south.  Don't really remember much about that meal, but this morning's is fresh on my mind.\n\nI ordered a waffle with a side of bacon, and a cup of coffee.  To summarize, it was a disappointment.  The coffee was the best part of the meal.  \n\nThe waffle was a bit overdone, thin, and just looked plain sorry.  The waffles at the Best Western complimentary breakfast beat the pants off this one.\n\nThe \"butter\" wasn't butter, it was some gawd-awful corn oil based \"spread\" with an unnaturally dark yellow color.  Ick.  I didn't ask if they had real butter because I didn't want to seem like a pain in the ass. \n\nThe bacon was edible, but the three strips looked somewhat unnatural, like it was some bacon substitute.  \n\nThe staff was cool, and I don't think it's fair to blame them for the quality of the food.  At almost $8 for the meal however, this was enough to drive me back into the arms of my old nemesis -- Denny's.   \n\nMakes me wish there was an Old Brass Rail nearby that was open 24/7.  Maybe I need to move to Vegas if I want to continue living this vampire lifestyle.
2 ||| Okay, we see the commercials all the time in Los Angeles which is silly because there are no Cracker Barrel restaurants/stores in all of California. So when planning our trip to Phoenix I decided to look and see if there was a Cracker Barrel anywhere near the resort. Awesome there was one just one exit up on the 10 freeway. The anticipation was high as we pulled in and saw the rows of rocking chairs for sale in front then once inside the smell of cinnamon candles was overwhelming. The novelty of this place in unbelievable. With Moon pies and jumbo size candy bars and soda and coffee and bake mix and I could go on, but my review is really for the restaurant.  I ordered the Chicken and Dumplins no \"g\" in dumplins cuz were tryin to be authentic here. for my sides I ordered the Fried apples and steak fries. Okay the dumplins are not like my mommas these are the noodle flat kind of dumplins but they also had no flavor. I had to douse them with salt and pepper to get flavor into them. The fried apples were the best part of the meal. Also you get your choice of bread, I love corn bread so I picked that. My wife picked the buttermilk biscuit. I should have taken the Buttermilk Biscuit. Maybe my taste buds took a vacation but the cornbread had no flavor at all, She ordered the grilled chicken tenders mashed potatoes and Fries. She said all of her food was good, she asked me if I wanted to try them but I told her it might mess up my review of the restaurant.  So for novelty, I give it a five, for my food I give it a two for my wife's food I give it a four so overall average is three.
1 ||| Have been eating here for 25 years. It used to my favorite place for barbecue. I ordered a half rack of ribs and the bones were soft and tasted awful. The waitress took it back to the cook. The cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib. I won't be going back sad to say.
4 ||| I have been to a few Black Angus locations and this one is the best.  The atmosphere is good whether it's lunch time or dinner time.  The service is always friendly and usually pretty good.  The manager will come through and ask how you're doing and clear dishes and such.  That is a rarity to see management do any kind of manual labor.  I do feel that it is a bit pricier here than it should be.  $29 for a steak and they want to charge extra for a side of asparagus?  That does not seem right, but I will definitely eat here again.  The steaks are awesome.
3 ||| This hotel was recommended by my daughters friend that has stayed with her dogs and she highly recommended with our dogs. We only stayed one night.\nRoom was clean, bed was great, breakfast hot and delicious, mini refrigerator came in handy with our dog food. The only problem was we forgot the wine cooler sleeve inside the freezer section, I have called them to see if they could send it back to us and they told me they need to ask the cleaning clew to see if they found it, I have not heard from them since. \nHotel location was too far away from the strip driving 25 minutes from strip late at night is not fun. Otherwise location was very safe even late at night walking the dogs even though I did see some homeless people around.\n\nWill stay again.\nThank you.
1 ||| Well kudos for them being one of the few spots open on Christmas day. It was pretty packed and we  had to wait 15/20 minutes, which was not too bad. We had the wings as appetizer and they taste just out their TGiFridays frozen food line. I remember the sizzling chicken and shrimp being tasty; however not this visit. I know it has been a few years, but I really do not recall that icky marinara on the shrimp. I am almost certain they use to be scampi*shrugs* Our server was just okay and seemed to be little scattered and not as sunny as a few others. We both felt bloated and nauseated later on and this pretty much hammers the nail in the coffin. Highly doubt we will ever return.
3 ||| Keep this place a secret. \nI'm a foodie and a food critic, this is my go to place for Thai. Nothing disappoints.
1 ||| Ya Think They'd Know the Menu!. Walked over from the nearby hotel to grab something quick.  Ordered the Cran' Club.  Turkey with Cranberry.  Took it to go and when I open the wrapper to eat it, I found they left off the cranberry.  Hope they read this and do something about it.  I'll let you all know.
3 ||| Good little spot in an interesting location.  Sort of a business park/industrial area and it's tucked away.  They seem to have a good local following. \n\nI had the half soup/sandwich but no coffee this time.  Based on other coffee review comments, I'm going to have to stop by for a cappucino.\n\nGood prices, GREAT soup (chicken corn chowder).
0 ||| Yuck!!! This place does not deserve a 1 star at all... I wish I can give it 0. The food was absolutely horrible.\n\nThe service was average, a little slow for a restaurant that is not busy, the waitress seemed side-tracked.\n\nThe only reason why we came here was because Mom said when she came around 2007 it was pretty good, but NOW WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK. The food was not worth $75+, what a rip off.
0 ||| Service was not great and the woman did not listen to me. She did not speak or understand English too well it seems.  I told her I wanted white tip on my toes just like what was on my hands. I wasn't watching until she started putting this red toned clear polish kinda like pink and white nails. I have no idea why she did that when my finger nails are clearly clear. Ugh. \n\nI will say that she did the right thing when it came to do my designs. She knew she could not do what I asked so she had someone else come and do it.  They have maybe 20 designs to choose from so I'm guessing if you came in wanting one you need a picture or they just freestyle but I wouldn't trust that.\n\nAlso, the place needs to be cleaned, dusted, etc. The pedicure chairs arms are cracking. I only came here because I was waiting for an eyelash appt and this was in the same plaza. I would not specifically seek this place out in the future.\n\nI paid $17 for white tip on my toes with a design on each of my big toes. Then after closer inspection when I walked out I saw how bad a job she did on my lines. \n\nThey need to go back to nail school and brush up on technique and sanitation if they plan on remaining open.
4 ||| Tastiest selection of Tagalog cuisine in Lost Wages.
0 ||| We went here for my girlfriends brother in laws birthday (confusing?). We were sat in a large booth, 8 adults, one toddler, and a newborn baby. \n\nEven though we were in a large booth, it was still a tight fit, also, the carrier (with the baby in it) was on the floor most of the time, until they brought us a chair to put the carrier on.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is LOUD. Not just music, but people talking loudly as well. The walls beyond covered in \"stuff\", things like dollar bills, stuffed dead animals, panties, pictures, license plates, I guess the closest thing you could guess in theme would be \"trailer park\". \n\nThe waitress was not accommodating to the noise, and spoke mostly in a whisper. She spent most of the time looking annoyed, speaking in a low voice that we could barely hear, and acting spastic (not taking our orders in an orderly way, bringing some food but not all that we had ordered, refilling some drinks but not others, etc). \n\nI ordered the Prime Rib, rare, with mashed potatoes. It came with a side salad consisting of iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, and minced green olives. An odd combination. The prime rib was overly marinated in \"smoke flavor\" and had more flavor reminiscent of ham than of prime rib. It was a good portion. The mashed potatoes were dry and partially cold, not very flavorful. I requested no gravy, yet my mashed potatoes still had that dip in them where you would normally put gravy, meaning I had a very small portion of mashed potatoes (that you probably don't notice when you get gravy). \n\nMy girlfriend had the same thing I did but medium instead of rare like I did, everyone else in the party had the chicken fried steak. My girlfriend was as disappointed in her food as I was. Everyone who ordered chicken fried steak loved it. It really is a giant portion, two, three servings really. Most everyone took some of theirs home. Though the two people from texas said it wasn't the best chicken fried steak they'd ever had, and I'd take that recommendation into consideration. Texas people know their chicken fried steak. \n\nFor dessert my girlfriend and I shared the peach cobbler. This menu description is inaccurate, its more akin to yellow cake with peach filling. Tasty, but not what we expected. They do use blue bunny ice cream though, which is awesome. \n\nAbout an hour after dinner my girlfriend and I both felt a little sick from dinner. We didn't get sick, but definitely needed some pepto.
2 ||| First night time visit to Mama's..wow this place is a goldmine..packed with people, pretty high noise level, but they were very accomodating when we added 2 extra people to our reservation.  The BREAD, yes it was incredible warm and soft and seasoned..not Italian bread but a lovely soft dinner roll -- very addicting. Our waitress was very nice, fairly fast and concerned about our order. We started out with Calamari...not the right choice ..it was Mrs. Pauls...thick heavy breaded with all the same size rings?? Our friends had the Bruschetta --it looked very good. Our Drinks came and they were not made correctly but the waitress cheerfully took them back to the bar and brought out another version, still not right -- and irritating when we got the check and it was 8.20 for the drink and 2.50 for the bar brand liquor in it. That means we paid 8.20 for club soda and a cherry..hmmmm\nI ordered the Spaghetti all Gricia..it was thin spaghetti and caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon, and pecorino cheese. Very interesting..not Italian but really good ..but I would rename it Bacon Lo Mein...My Husband ordered the Lasagna, he said it was good but the meat was stringy?? Our friends had the Pollo Romano, which was basically a Chicken Parm, it was a great size portion, and seemed like our friend enjoyed it. Her partner had the Cotoletta ala bolognese, it was a fried chicken cutlet topped with Parmesan cheese and proscuitto, It was also a nice size portion but it was swimming in grease, like the cheese had melted and they used to much oil to fry it..they did replate it for my friend but she could still not eat it and they very nicely took it off the bill. \nThe desert....was the VERY best thing on the menu--NUTELLA PIE..It was a combo of Nutella, peanut butter, marscapone cheese with a graham cracker crust...heavenly, I would have eaten more but I had filled up on the bread!\nAll in all..its a okay dinner place...not authentic Italian at all..Large family style portions, but not my AMORE...Loved our company..not so much the meal..Sorry Mama....
0 ||| I will say he is a good surgeon, but it is all about the money, I had to come up with a deposit of $1500 for the surgery and was told that after the insurance company paid, it would be returned. Well, it was not returned, and I asked about it on every visit after the surgery. I was told they would contact the billing office. I paid for the surgery and the insurance company paid for the surgery. Dr Teng was paid twice. I did not have any deductible, so I would not recommend going to Dr. Teng because it is greed that motivates him and if asked for a deposit, remember, you will never see it returned as promised.
4 ||| El Pulgarcito de America (the little thumb in Spanish) is not to be confused with the umpteen million Latin restaurants on Central Avenue.  Over the years of eating countless Mexican and Latin American dishes, I think I've become quite discerning of quality food. El Pulgarcito hits the mark! \n\nAt a recent Yelp! lunch event, I had the infamous pupusas.  Grilled tortilla patties with gooey pork and cheese filling.  Yum yum! At a $1.50 a piece, pupusas are best thing since tacos (maybe better).  They served them with 'curtido', spicy coleslaw, and I doused them a generous helping of salsa verde for extra kick.  Like my fellow Yelpers (Tiffany N. and Nicole W.), I was joneseing to come back and try the colossal platters that other passed by us as we ate.  The staff spoke decent English and were graceful with our Spanglish faux-pas as we attempted to order while pointing at colorful menu photos.  Luckily, no order was lost in translation.  \n\nInstead, our lunch party got far more than we were bargaining for.  What looked like a small plate of goodies ended up being a platter, resulting in the sharing fried tamales, fried plantains, chicken tacos with onion and cilantro...you get the picture.  Depsite the heaping plates, I don't think anyone paid more than $10 for their lunch.\n\nEl Pulgarcito is a virtually smorgasboard of Mexican and Central American food and culture.  The walls are covered with Latin kitsch, telenovelas are playing on the TV's, and yet the deer antlers remind you haven't left the South.  Take a seat, eat to your heart's delight, and stagger home stuffed!
4 ||| Nice place. The staff is nice\nDefinitely mom and pop shop. The pizza was good and the prices were a little high. I happened to try their pide because I've never had it, and let's say it was not pleasing to the American pallet. It was too spicy and no cheese! If you like plain pizza stay away from the pide. Their commercials are always on TV. If your looking for a good pizza place try milanos.
4 ||| When your dog likes the vet what more can you say. The staff friendliness and professionalism of this animal hospital is through the roof. \nWe found this place by mistake and it was the best mistake we made for our little puggle. \nBianca & Adrianna behind the front desk are always most helpful and the rest of the staff is equally as attentive. The doctors are all gentle and forthright. The costs are very competitive and supply of treats and quality food make it convenient to come here for simple maintenance things. Here's an example, we come here for the dog to get her nails cut, they ask us if we should drain the anal glands and we pick up a bag of qualify food.... $40. \n\nIf you live in the anthem or silverado areas, it's worth passing other vets to get to this one. We do, and we couldn't be happier.
1 ||| Not impressed! I really wanted to like this place because it was voted a New Times best for a couple of years but I was very disappointed. I brought my new car in for its first wash after taking it to Cali for the weekend and having the front covered in bug goo from the drive. So I got my car back and noticed on the front bumper there were still bug guts left there. Also, I left an empty plastic water bottle from the trip on the floor in my haste to get out so the guys could work their magic.  Well they left it in there along with some paper straw wrappers in the door pockets, which i feel they should grab when they are vacuuming. Sorry Los Olivos I wanted to make you my regular car wash but you just didn't cut it.
0 ||| In Oct 2014 we shipped a package double boxed and packed with air pillows from The UPS Store 3590 on Val Vista in Gilbert, AZ.  We even have pictures from the company we shipped the headlights to that prove our packaging.  The box was damaged when it arrived at its destination. We bought and paid for insurance.  One headlight was broke during shipping and UPS is refusing to pay for the product saying that they didn't break it during shipping.  We have tried repeatedly to speak with the manager of The UPS Store 3590 but he is never there. He never returns our calls even though we have left the number numerous times. We have also emailed the store and UPS claims department with no success.  The claims department says that we have to reopen the claim with the store that we shipped from. We have physically stopped at The UPS Store 3590 on different days and times and are told the manager isn't there but try this day/time.  Again when we arrive he isn't there.  We insured the package for $800 and only asked for $450 to cover one headlight and shipping.  We are so upset that the manager won't help us or return calls.  If you use this store to ship be aware that they do not stand behind their insurance policy so it is a total waste of your money.  We will not use this UPS store again or recommend them to anyone needing to ship items.

2 ||| Okay, I've been to a lot of gluten free bakeries  since I have Celiac's and I really, really want to like this one because the selection is amazing. I mean, pasta, a million types of bread and pastries... but, I just can't like this one.\n\nI've had several different varieties of things, egg-free, casein free, just the gluten free stuff, but they all lacked moisture. And that's the thing I find in this bakery, is that the items all consistently lack moisture. And yes that's hard to do with GF baking but it can be done.  I haven't found a product I truly enjoy, everything sort of tastes like a chalky, crumbly version of a Pillsbury product. The bread is also dense (I've had gluten-free bread that isn't) and costs way too much - its almost cheaper to buy the frozen GF bread from the grocery store.\n\nThe other thing that worries me is there is a regular bakery next door, and while I assume that they do not share a ventilation system I do worry about contamination. (Flour can stay suspended in the air for 3 - 10 days) and if you are sensitive to gluten that can be worrisome.\n\nThe staff is friendly though, and the place is warm and cozy - I just wish the food tasted like it.

4 ||| When my good friend notified me that Bruce Moffet had recently been recognized as one of the best chefs in Charlotte on the cover of Creative Loafing this month, we just had to eat here.  So we made reservations for 7:00 PM yesterday evening for dinner.  The place was completely full on a Wednesday night if that tells you anything.  You see my good friend and I worked for Bruce in his early restaurant days at Pizza Villa over 20 years ago and were shocked to hear that he bought the place 18 years ago and was recognized as having some of the best food Charlotte has to offer!!  Where does the time go?  Anyway - I had the Pecan crusted pork tenderloin and my friend had the Braised Beef Short Ribs.  He also had the Arugula salad with bleu cheese and we each had the French Onion soup.  All of it was outrageously delicious and we will definitely be returning for a future special occasion.  You will not be disappointed should you choose to visit Barrington's!
3 ||| PSA: there is a groupon for this place that is valid until May 2015!\n\nBurger was good. Mac and cheese was a little salty and not very warm but it wasn't terrible. Cookies and cream dessert was super yummy. \n\nService was very attentive and we went on a Saturday night. \n\nKinda dim and loud in there...it is a bar after all, and there is some interesting religious art work on the walls.
0 ||| What a dreadul experience.  I had reserved and prepaid via Hotwire but all these folks do is PUSH PUSH PUSH for extras and more money.  I could hear it all around me. My agent took the cake (think her name was Angela).  I was in Phoenix for a little over a day, and was running late (good old USAirways, landed early but the gate was not free and we were stuck on the runway for almost an hour) for a tight business deadline.\n\nWould I like an upgrade - \"we have a really nice BMW for you\" - how much is that? An extra $99 per day on top of what I had paid - no thanks.  Well I can get you something more comfortable, or fun like a Jeep Wrangler.  NO thanks, I just want what I paid for.  How about an SUV - No thanks.  I just want the car I reserved (mid-size).  Well sorry - it will be a long wait - the ONLY car available (I was in a hurry) was the darned Wrangler (noisy POS that I totally did NOT want but she was determined to put me in) and then talked me into insurance before she would let me go - with taxes etc $85 for 28 hours.  Never again - I guess I'll book directly with Avis next time in Phoenix.  I never want to use Budget there again.  Thanks Angela
4 ||| I really loved this place and ate my dinner like it was going out of style. The beer was good and the food had excellent flavor. We had a great time eating with friends on the patio and my daughter loved watching the chefs through the huge kitchen windows.
4 ||| Great wings...cool place to chill
3 ||| Well let me say that I was suprised to see how busy this place was on a Monday night.  With an open mind I met some people there for an xmas party.  They were able to accomidate our party of 14 within 30 minutes.  As for the food, well, its basic Asian food done in a good way.  The mongolian BBQ station was nice and the seafood was in abundence for those who like it.  All this for 11.50 not bad.  This place was decent for a buffet.  One bad thing was that it was cramped where we were sitting. oh well all in .all it was a good choice
4 ||| This was a really good bowl of pho.  I was disappointed when I saw the bowl was not as large as the usual bowls that I get, but that medium-sized bowl really filled me up.  The aroma from the bowl of pho felt like I had something homemade.  I wouldn't have gone here unless I had a car.  There were so many items on the strip that I wanted to try.\n\nThere is an asian strip off of Spring Mountain with so many restaurants and stores.  You can save money and have a good meal by taking a little drive.
1 ||| Quality and service is terrible here. There is way many better Italian food restaurants in the valley. \n\nI got the egg plant parmesan and it looked like my 7 year old tried to make it or it came from a box. The sauce was so so. It's definitely more of a tourist attraction or a place for people who haven't eaten real Italian food. Save your money, get a can of Chef Boyardee. It tastes way better!
1 ||| This was our first time here and all I can really say is, Meh. We walked into the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for someone to come to the hostess stand. Then we waited another few minutes for the woman to escort us back. She was nice, but there should have been someone at the hostess stand when we walked in. \n\nSo let's discuss these little booths that they have. The problem with a place that puts you in a small booth with curtains is that it gets stuffy. When the curtains open air flows in and if your server is say, a smoker, you will smell nothing but the smoke. This is what happened to my husband and I. I am very sensitive to smoke, so I think I noticed it more than him. The food was OK. The service was SLOW, it took us over 2 hours to have two cheese fondue courses and some chocolate. We might be back to check out the happy hour specials.
0 ||| This is one of the worst motels that I've ever stayed at before in my life, and I've stayed at many hotels and motels in my lifetime. \n\nMy wife and I moved to Phoenix and needed a place to stay for a week until our apartment was ready. Found Studio 6 on Google and the photos on their website looked good. Unfortunately for me, I failed to read the reviews prior to booking my 8 night stay. \n\nWe arrived late at night to be greeted by the laundry guy who gave us our keys to the room. The room was allegedly non-smoking, but this was not accurate at all. The room reeked of smoke and cheap cleaning products that were used to try and mask the smell. The room was fantastically filthy, among the filthiest I've ever seen in my life, I took and uploaded pictures to prove how disgusting this place was. There was blood on one of our pillows, dirt and dust all over the entire room. The room we were staying in must have been hosting a punching contest, because the refrigerator in the room had a giant fist imprint in it. \n\nI asked the laundry man for another room, as this one was just clearly unacceptable. Because he did not have access to a computer, he pulled out a large sheet of room numbers and guest names and began randomly picking rooms to check to see if they were clean, so that we could move. After nearly 30 minutes of using this primitive room tracking method, he finally located one. This room that he found also reeked of smoke! \n\nThe room at the end of the hallway from the one that we were assigned, housed a large man, who kept the motel room door wide open, whilst he exposed himself on the bed wearing nothing but boxers. Not only did I feel extremely unsafe, but felt that my wife and I both would be raped during the night while sleeping, and there would be nothing left to our cars by sunrise. \n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot to mention the extremely loud Harley Davidson people who continually revved up their annoying engines throughout the night. In the morning, the Harley guy returned and after discovering there was no parking space for him to park his bike, he drove up on the sidewalk and into the gravel, then proceeding to park it there as if it was his own personal parking space. \n\nTo top it all off, there was a giant box of cats.... Yes, \"cat's\" outside of one of the rooms on the ground level. Not sure what happened here, but after we loaded up our cars to make our race to safety, we noticed the box of cat's disappeared... Perhaps they were drug cats? The world will never know... \n\nMy advice is to spend the extra money and go to Extended Stay America down the street. Don't risk getting AIDS, don't risk being raped... Hell exists, and it's the Studio Six in Deer Valley!
4 ||| Was I crazy taking my car to a self admitted Madman?\n\nWould I regret sitting down at this tea party? \n\nWould the Time is takes to complete the car work be affected by mustard on the guy's watch?\n\nIs the Queen correct, should he be beheaded?\n\nThe answer to all of these is NO!\n\n1 star for getting a friendly, calm voice, telling me their hours and to bring it in whenever I wished, first come first serve and meaning it. No push one for English, no confusing bumbling appointment scheduler, no leaving my car there overnight, handing out my key so they can get to it \"sometime.\" \n\n1 star for putting my car up on the lift right away and describing each of the sections that required repair and why, showing me the parts in advance; breaking down the quoted repair before beginning any maintenance. No surprises, total professionals.\n\n1 star for completing the repair in 45 minutes, same day with all new parts, full warranty. Drove away after spending less time than it takes to get a lunch.\n\n1 star for adjusting the muffler the next day with no appointment required or cost when we detected a rattle. Great handshake and pleasant quick attention. Took less than 5 minutes!\n\n1 star for contributing to the community a portion of proceeds to help veterans and schools.\n\nFor a grand total of perfect 5 stars. This is obviously the complete madness they refer to in the name. Compared to the usual run around you get with shady car repair places, this was insane in a good way.\n\nIf you need work done on your car exhaust and you don't know who to trust or go to, take my word for it, go to Mad Hatter. It was painless and the cost was half of what I expected from another shop or dealer.\n \nThey will be our go to repair place for these needs from now on.
2 ||| Good but not great.   Occasionally I have found some of their sale prices to be a great deal.  But watch out if it isn't on sale.  OUCH! Items can be way overpriced.   \n\nThey do make some good looking bakery items.  I try to resist the sugar temptation as much as possible.  There is a chicken wing bar and olive bar for someone's quick lunch also.  Don't forget the Starbucks located just inside of the entrance.  Love that! \n\nThey used to have self checkouts.  I love using self checkouts which made it easy for me to make a quick stop.   Now they are gone and seems to create a longer waits and checkout times.  Bring them back! They are convenient so I wonder why they removed them.   \n\nSo for me if they have something in their sale ad that I need, I don't mind stopping in.
2 ||| I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.
3 ||| There is nothing not to like about this place, great sandwiches and a friendly staff of people working behind the counter.  Forget about the chains and give this place a try you willl be glad you did.
1 ||| This is the one and only Pizza Hut that I have been to that doesn't make pizza like every other one in the world. That being said, I have given them numerous chances to do better thanks to their proximity, $10 pizza price and lack of any other good pizza in town. \n\nThe last time it was worse then horrible and they even had a offer for their new pizza stating that you would get a free pizza or money back, don't know which if it wasn't right. I ordered once and asked for no green peppers. Green peppers are something that even if you pull them off the flavor stays. I let it go because I seriously am so tired of having to complain. All I want is a decent meal. So, the next week I ordered again. When my pizza showed up with no black olives I called. I told them about the previous results and that I hadn't complained or requested the meal free as advertised. The manager told me that he would credit our bill by $10 and he never did. \n\nThe time spent on the phone when all I wanted was the meal I ordered and for it to taste like every other pizza hut....\n\nI ordered from the Pizza Hut on Watsons and picked up. Their pizza, while really over cooked, I was so happy with because it tasted like a normal Pizza Hut! \n\nI really wish they would allow you to contact the owner and let them know. They loose a lot of money by loosing customers. I went so far as to contact corporate only Pizza Hut about a year ago about this same Pizza Hut. They didn't bother to answer so it's pretty clear that they just don't care.\n\nI remember back home, we would go 20 miles out of our way to go to the Pizza Hut and eat... Such a shame. You can not just get take out from the other location even though it's six miles from us because the website defaults you to the other location!
0 ||| Despite the decent atmosphere and not too terrible location we get sat at one of the greasiest tables I've seen in a long time. We order appetizers and they come posthaste. Good, but not worth 10$ a plate good... Then comes the pink prickly pear chicken :/ poor execution at a great recipe. The goat cheese bruschetta was OK but slightly disappointing. If you want a 50$ tab for a few drink+ appetizers and 1 entree i suggest you go somewhere else. Oh and don't even think about giving them a bad yelp review, the owner will put a plaque on the wall for anyone that takes the time to write about how disappointing the food is. Guy can't take a hint.
3 ||| Good Irish breakfast.  Even though this is chain, there are staff from Erin who are happy to serve you.  The Guinness is good and the craic is better when with friends.  Only complaint is that I think they deep fry the white and black pudding which is a no-no...
4 ||| Calzones!! This has got to be THE best place for a calzone, hands down. Packed full of cheese, wrapped in a tasty crust,  and then, for a few bucks more, add all your favorite meats and tasty morsals...you'll be walking away feeling like you really ate something special.
3 ||| This has to one of the cheapest eats in Surprise for kids. Free kids meal from 4 to 10. Yes you have to buy an adult meal, but even my meal was not really steep. I enjoyed a steak omelet and it also included 3 pancakes. A serious meal for 8.99 I could not resist some coffee to make it a real breakfast for me. The endless pot of coffee was a little over 2 bucks. \nMy son enjoyed the large create a face which ended up being his dinner and breakfast for the next day. Not a bad deal in my book. \nIf you have kids and want to treat them to a night out, why not try an American classic Ihop? This particular one, in Surprise does get busy and yes sometimes the service is not top notch, but I give them credit.... When the place is packed I am sure they can get slammed with work. I practiced patience and enjoyed another cup of joe from my endless carafe. Don't worry the french vanilla cream sure does make the coffee taste good.  Take the kids out and enjoy.
4 ||| All the food is great. Best Mexican food. Everything is freshly made. Guacamole and chorizo are the best. People are very friendly too.
3 ||| We have ate here two years in a row while working in town. It was pretty good. Lots of different beer choices.  Had the pork sandwich and pizza.  Both were good.  Seating is kind of rough it you have more than 4.
4 ||| I have been extremely pleased with the care and knowledge offered here (and we tried others when we arrived three years ago). With two cats (formerly three) and a dog, we tend to be pretty good veterinary customers.\n\nEvery time we visit, we get plenty of attention from the doctors and staff. While they clearly are focusing their interest on the patient, they take the time to answer questions and explain things in simple and easy-to-understand terms. The \"take home\" materials are also written in uncomplicated language.\n\nThe outer office is clean and well mopped. The files seem to be pretty organized and they are plugged in to technology, as we just got an email with our shot updates. The examination rooms are also very clean with plenty of room for \"mom and dad\" to accompany the patient without it getting too crowded.\n\nPrices are reasonable and since we're \"regulars\" they do give us the occasional discount on office visits and such. If we ever move to another part of Charlotte, we'll still come back to Long Animal Hospital!
0 ||| I wish I had a 'to be fair' line I could throw in here, but it's impossible. My wife and I ate at the Golden Steer on 5/16/13 (Her review is before the Golden Steer plant's review below mine.), and the food was simply horrible. For starters, we sat at the Marilyn Monroe table. Yes, the place has been open for a while, but they do stress the old star-power a bit much, making one wonder of the quality of the food. You'll see why I say this: \n\nWhen the bread and butter was brought out, we were eating it and noticed a really strange flavor. I tasted the butter on its own, and it tasted as if it had sat in the fridge for a very - very long time before being brought to our table. Sure we wanted to sit in Marilyn's booth, but we did not want to eat the same butter that was served to her!!! Right then and there I wanted to get out as fast as possible. Nevertheless, we decided to overlook this, notify the waiter, and give them another chance. He didn't bring out any more bread and butter, hence the bad butter must've been all they had. NOTE: Steak is often cooked with butter....\n\nThe ceasar salad came out and it was prepared at the table. We passed on the raw egg, which I feel is a wise move after reading previous reviews alleging salmonella. Barring that, the salad was edible. \n\nI ordered the ribeye medium rare, and my wife ordered the porterhouse steak. Mine actually was tasty, though bloody and borderline raw. My wife's porterhouse, on the other hand, was a different story. She told me her steak tasted a bit off, similar to liver. I took a taste. To me it tasted like pee! I spit the bite into my napkin.   The waiter attempted damage control by bringing her a slab of prime rib. She didn't like it. I tasted it, and it was bland, unsalted, and I have had better at $15 buffets - time and time again. \n\nI really wish I didn't have to write such a scathing review, but this place is priced like an exclusive fine-dining establishment, yet prepares food like as if to act in direct defiance of the health dept. We will not be returning.
4 ||| At Bad Apple Tattoo getting some work done and this place comes highly recommended.\n\nMy husband went and grabbed food and was back in about 10 minutes. Fast service.\n\nThe food was amazing. The sides of cucumber sauce are huge, so try the one before ordering more. The gyro time sammich is delicious and I hope to be back!
4 ||| I've always wanted to go to Sonoma Cellar.  Ever  since it 1st opened. We finally went for our anniversary!  Funny thing is, INTERESTINgS things happen there. Like our wedding song came on when right after we were seated.  Then after our meal they brought us a happy anniversary cake. Yet, we did not tell anyone it was our anniversary. Except another couple before we were seated. Although, my blackened salmon was very good. It's the little things like this that make it memorable.
2 ||| The staff were all very polite. We were seated right away and able to order quickly. However we noticed that orders sat for several minutes before being delivered. When we received our food sure enough it was cool. However the country fried steak was steamy hot. The cooks need to learn the proper food prep order so everything is hot. Won't be back to this location.
1 ||| I like dunkin'  but the service sucks ..  The cashier was rude but I would be too if I had that job. \n\n\n\n\nShe messed up on our order didn't go back to change it because it would've been a waste of time she probably would've messed up on that as well. \n\nJust left dunkin' 20min ago!
2 ||| Sorry, Chandler Library.\nYou just don't live up to your counterparts in Mesa. \nYour building is beautiful, your librarians are super friendly, and the fact that you have a cafe with smoothies is very creative.\n\nBut what brings me back to a library is, quite simply, the books. And you don't have enough of what I want. \nSo many of your books are very old... and when I went to see your \"new releases\" bookshelves, well, there just wasn't anything there that piqued my interest.\n\nI wanted two new books - ones that aren't hard to find. Ones that are on the shelves at Barnes & Noble, etc. When I searched the card catalog, you didn't have them. Anywhere. They weren't even checked out - you just didn't have them.\n\nI went to the Mesa library's catalog, found both of them, and requested them. Within a week, both books were waiting for me on a shelf, with my name on them, at the Dobson Ranch Library.\n\nSorry, CPL. I just probably won't be back.
4 ||| My BF got us tickets with the best intentions.  He thought it would be a great excuse to doll up. BUT I think we went overboard.  When we got there it felt like were the only ones that dolled up. =(\n\nLots of stuck up older women. Felt like a scene from pretty woman... UGH....  I didn't think I looked like a hooker at all but when in the elevator I questioned my outfit.  *** I should have worn nylons or slacks lol*** cause obviously a peplum pencil skirt and a silk blouse made me look like a whore!!  \n\n\nWe spent the whole day driving so when we saw the concert.....the beautiful music got us so SLEEPY...  we ended up leaving early. =(\n\nWe promised to each other that we will come back in 15 years!!
2 ||| We had a coupon and was craving steak so we went here. Let's start with at 6pm on a Saturday it was empty but for an older group. The decor would make you think you where at grandmas house. The place was dark and was not very inviting. We decided to share the filet and I wanted it rare it was raw cold and fatty. I know they are not a high end place but it was just cheap. Chewy and tasted like it was thrown in a broiler. They offered to bring something else, so I had potato soup and it was bland, boring, and lacking anything that would make me want to come back.
4 ||| We decided to try Avanti's for the first time in a while tonight for the Friday night fish special.  We had heard the restaurant was under new management.  We were very satisfied with our decision.  The fish special my wife and I had were both excellent.  I had the fried cod and it was very good.  My wife had the baked cod and said it was delicious. My wife and I both liked the redesign of the interior.  We will not hesitate to dine here again.  Thank you for a nice dinner.
4 ||| Brooke did both my hair (and my mom and maid of honor) for my wedding!\n\nWe were a pretty simple group (I was the easiest of all of them- all I really wanted was a professional blowout) but she listened to what all of us had to say.  She was professional and punctual but still kind and worked well with my makeup artist.  The pair of them tag-teamed us and all 3 of us were done within an hour or so.\n\nI was very happy with how all 3 styles turned out.\n\nStrongly recommend her for any brides looking for a stylist.  I can't comment on her cuts or color though!
1 ||| *Disappointing, uncaring experience.  No follow-up.  Apparent left-hand/right-hand problems in the office, but at least the office staff is pleasant...*\n\nHeard some good things about this practice, so it came to mind when I had a recent medical issue (and needed to find a new PCP).  \n\nI had some flank pain and then days later had an incident of hematuria (rather unsettling and far too much for me to trust my Internet medical degree).  So, I went ahead made an appointment.\n\nScheduling was smooth/friendly.  Got a relatively quick appointment (called on Friday, appointment on Monday) to see the NP at their new location on Thompson Peak.\n\nDay of the appointment, the desk personnel were friendly, the paperwork normal, and the desk personnel pleasant/friendly.   The wait was quite reasonable (pretty close to scheduled time - unusual for a doctor's office).\n\nThe MA was generally friendly and efficient, and the wait for the NP was short.  The NP was professional (though some might not think of her as \"friendly\" or \"pleasant\").  As a previous reviewer mentioned, she was laptop-focused and efficient.\n\nLeft a quick sample (verified hematuria w/in a few minutes) and received an order for anti-biotics (to fight off any potential kidney infection) and an ultrasound - and told to try and get one right away (to look for stones).\n\nGot an appointment and took care of the ultrasound that afternoon.\n\nThe following evening I experienced some pretty severe flank pain in the middle of the night, but it subsided on its own.  I logged into their patient portal and left a note to that effect.\n\nTwo days later, not having heard anything back (odd as the radiologist's office indicated results would be sent to my PCP next day), I called the office at around 1:45p, and was told that the NP had not reviewed the results yet, but that they would take my callback number and send her message to review the ultrasound.\n\nAt first, I was kind of annoyed, but then, I was actually kinda of happy to hear that it wasn't a priority (must not be that bad).\n\nLater that afternoon (~5:30p), I receive a message via their patient portal from the NP asking if I had gotten an ultrasound and rather curtly telling me that I really need to go get that ultrasound...  HUH?\n\nSo, I sent a reply letting her know that I had gotten the ultrasound and contacted the office earlier that afternoon.\n\nThe next day, I get a call from a pleasant person from their office (not an NP or doctor) letting me know that a doctor had reviewed the ultrasound, and it was clear/normal (no cysts or stones).  OK - cool.  So, of course, I asked, great, what next?  I'd really like to get to the bottom of this... And the answer was literally, \"Well, I don't know, but at least the ultrasound was clear!\" (and I could hear the very genuine smile on the other end).\n\nIt has been 3 days, no response to the message I sent in reply in the patient portal.  No follow-up.  No posting of the ultrasound results to the patient portal.  Nothing.  Silence.\n\nMaybe my expectations are skewed, as I have been somewhat fortunate in never having any real medical issue to date, but when I see myself pissing blood and have unexplained flank pain, I really, really wanna understand why - and I kinda feel like my care provider would generally follow-up quickly on something like this - or at least tell me if there's nothing to follow-up on.   \n\nReally.  You don't even have to call me.  I like technology.  Use your patient portal and copy+paste your notes... Really.\n\nAt the end of the day, I suppose I'm responsible for my own well-being though, and so I will.  I've got an appointment with a new doctor tomorrow afternoon :-).  Maybe it's nothing.  Maybe it's something, but I'll keep looking until I find a care provider that can/would-like-to help me find out.
4 ||| Everyone there knows us. Everyone there knows Zoey, our Great Dane.  Everyone is amazing! Which is why we continually drive 30 minutes to go to a Petsmart, so we can get the daycare we know is best for our girl.  Trust me, if I didn't feel safe with her there, or if I felt the people didn't love her, we'd go somewhere else.  But they're fantastic so no worries.  : )
3 ||| Good service with big portion great tasting food. You definitely get your moneys worth. Plenty to choose from on their menu.
4 ||| Definitely my favorite German restaurant, this place brings back memories.... often a bit negative as it's right near the hospital... yes, my Mom took me there after my arm breaking fiasco, that time I got hit by the car, etc., etc. (I was obviously an uncoordinated child), but also wonderful as I could literally lose myself in their vast array of tasty foods.  It's definitely a North Side staple, and the atmosphere has a \"well worn\" appeal with old pictures of the local Germanic community and of the area.  This place has it's own personality, which is a plus in my opinion!\n\nAs for the food... well, you can't find much better German food than this and at this price!  Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.  Me, I love the stuffed pretzel appetizer, all the different sausages (the weisswurst is amazing!), and their kasespatzle (thick, doughy egg noodles with butter and cheese).  I will always associate Max's with the best, most flavorful German food at an affordable price!
4 ||| I like Uno's, really I do.  They have some pretty good pizza, and I can usually count on having a good time when I go.  But, as of lately, I just don't know anymore, especially after this past experience.  I will note, that my experiences at this Uno's have been during lunch hour only.  \n\nSo, when I go here, I usually sit at the bar for quicker service.  I've seen a couple different people working behind the counter, but this one girl has waited on me before.  She's a cute girl, with black curly hair and seems know her stuff.  My first complaint about her though, is that she constantly calls me \"sweetie\" or \"honey.\"  I hate that!   Your my server, stop calling me sweetie, ok?  So, she greets me with a  big smile and says \"I'll be right with you sweetie!\"  I'm already annoyed!\n\nSo, while I am waiting, I notice that the place just feels really dark and dismal.  Almost to dark.  I start to get a little depressed, and consider drinking, but snapped myself out of it becuase I had to back to work.\n\nAnyways, I digress.  So, the happy bartender gal takes my order.  I just ordered a chicken ceaser lunch salad.  Its half the size, and more importantly, half the freakin price!  I didn't want a wheelbarrel of salad people....just something to tide me over until I get off work, ya know?\n\nugh, I wait.  and I wait.  And I wait some more.  I'm reading a book, so time is flying quickly.  I took like 15 minutes to get my salad...and it was the wrong salad!  The girl apologized and was sincerely embarassed...then I became embarassed. \n\nI was like \"o, its okay, don't stress.\"  She says \"no no, I can take it back\"  We went back and forth over this for a few moments.  \n\n*sigh*\n\nSo, my point here is, I ate the salad.  She gave me a little bit off my tab, but it was so awkward for me, I didn't know what else to do.  The salad was tasty though.
4 ||| OMG, I practically inhaled my food.  The kare-kare was thick and creamy.  YUMMMM!  That was my favorite part of the meal.  And my sago drink was delicious.  This place was hella crackin.  The line curved around the restaurant.  GOOOOOOD foood!!!  I kinda wish I savored my meal, but whatevz, who needs to chew when you can just shallow.. lol.
4 ||| Forget about Starbucks. Coming from Miami for a business meeting I stopped here. These are the friendliest people you can find and the coffee is the best. It was a refreshing experience.
0 ||| TWC is the worst cable company I've ever dealt with. Each time I've called for Tech Support I was on hold for at least an hour. Their only response is to unplug the box.  I'm on my 2nd DVR box in 2 months & channels go out randomly.  If you can get cable somewhere else do it!
4 ||| The two times that I visited Arizona Mills, I spent time in their Starbucks, which is near the mall's south entrance. My seat of choice overlooked the hallway. This is a prime spot for people watching. Every seat in this Starbucks is a prime spot for complimentary WiFi. Over a cup of coffee with Pumpkin Spice syrup, I spent most of my time on my smart phone using their free WiFi.\n\n  The Arizona Mills Starbucks is a welcoming place. The place is designed to encourage you to spend time (and money) instead of rushing. The seats were so comfortable that we delayed seeing the movie at the mall's Harkins Theater by an hour.\n\n  The Arizona Mills Starbucks is clean at the same time that their baristas are fast and friendly. If Starbucks C.E.O Howard Schultz paid a visit to this Starbucks he would do the same thing as me, which is giving them a four star rating.
1 ||| I have been here many times with my cats and dog because its so close to my house. \n\nI always feel like they are trying to up sale me on EVERYTHING. The vet I always end up seeing isn't very friendly and I feel like she isn't really much of an animal lover. \n\nThe only reason why I'm giving three stars is because a few years ago I had brought my cat Salem in because he was drooling a lot and I thought that his sores were back from an allergy. He ended up having feline leukemia and I had to put him down right then. I was heartbroken and not ready to do that. A few days after I had gotten a card from them and a lot of he employees had written in it. It was very nice and thoughtful of them. \n\nBut because of feeling like they were pushing me to buy more things then I needed I've gone to another vet.
0 ||| This is the most overrated place bragged about in Pittsburgh. My first visit was to the one in South Hills. Waited 90 mins for 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands, I recommend it. It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz. At least I can get that without an attitude. If you have friends coming to visit from out of town, take them anywhere but here. And for those who say you have to go to the original one in the Strip, no thanks, it's the same food. If you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to Schmitz Old World Deli in Greenfield.
2 ||| Fish and shrimp tacos are great..LOVE the sauce!! The sides that come with the meal are awful tho. The parking sucks. Last time went on my lunch break..had to park almost 2 blocks away!! Did I say the sauce is really Gooooood?? Lol
2 ||| Went here once, I think on Christmas morning?  I had to work early and I knew they were going to be open, because I worked at a hotel, so we had to know what was open in the neighborhood. \n\nI had an omelette, typical diner food.  I thought it was related to the one in NYC, but it was not...
0 ||| I travel quite a bit and always enjoy great food.  I was in town on a business trip and someone recommended Roland's Seafood Grill.  I was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.  She went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers I selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps. \n\nI ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  They were cold but did not taste fresh.  Next I ordered the famous \"Lobster Roll\" which comes with fries and slaw.  It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast.  It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  The lobster inside was a small amount, cold and tough. The slaw was reasonably good and cold. \n\nThe server came back and I ordered a pint of draft beer.  After nearly another 20 minutes she returned, apologized and explained they were having more problems with their tap system and offered me a bottle of Guinness instead of the draft I ordered.  At this point I politely explained I did not want the bottled version and asked for the check.  \n\nI would be hard pressed to ever return.  With other great restaurant choices in the area I don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at Roland's Seafood Grill.
2 ||| I know the rating is low and part of it is undeserved. The people at Salon Sandoval are warm and welcoming and I have been happy with their services. They are an Aveda salon which is how I got their name. My stylist, Ruby, left there and then there seemed to be a ton of turnover. So, the reason for the rating? It's filthy. They honestly need to close for a week and have a deep cleaning, scrubbing, work it over. They also did a good job with my kids.
3 ||| So I'm having a steakhouse conversation with some friends and Sullivan's comes up...I know it's a chain, and I know there are more popular places in town, but if you have been here multile times, the overall consistency of the experience at Sullivan's stands out in my mind! I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal or service experience here. Of the upscale steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Beef and Bottle, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Palm, etc), Sullivan's may not rate as the best in each category (food, service, value, atmosphere), but I would put it 2 or 3 in each one - thus giving it the title of Charlotte's best steakhouse.
1 ||| We used to love this place, but the food has gone way downhill. I ordered the Vegetable Korma, and it looked like they used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables - it had corn and green beans in it, something I've never seen in any other Korma dish I've had. We also ordered the garlic naan, but it hardly had any garlic on it at all and tasted like it was reheated. I'm very sad because we used to go here all the time, but we won't be eating here anymore.
1 ||| Extremely slow delivery and the food is mediocre.
1 ||| Came to play in the Hispanic Men's tournament.... turned in our roster weeks in advance and came to play....after the first two games they started pulling players .....our manager asked for his $ back if they where going to have any more problems with our team, and they said no your good to play....Played our third and final game for the day and where told we played again on Sunday at 11 am....leave the park and get to our hotel and are informed by our manager that they told him, \"you played your guaranteed 3 games and you're no longer welcome to come back tomorrow.\"   WTH...why not just let us leave after the 1st or 2nd game???  FYI if ur going to hate on a Cali team then don't open ur tournament to everyone....top two teams CA & CA
2 ||| Here's how you can make your own Primanti Bros Sandwich at home:\n\nTake two slices of Italian Bread, between them, mash together bland cole slaw, fries, some assorted meat, tomatoes. And at your fingertips is Pitt's pride and joy.  I'm not from here, so maybe I don't share the love. We weren't really drunk when we were eating here, and it was in the middle of the day. \n\nThe service was pretty slow, but when our order was taken, the sandwich came out very fast.\n\nIt was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat, and cold tomatoes and cole slaw, but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.\n\nI think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast, and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw. \nI came, I saw, and I conquered, but I'm giving it back. I probably won't be back ever again.
1 ||| I've been to the Roasting Company on numerous occasions; that being said, feel free to take this review for what it's worth.\n\nThe Roasting Company just does not have the best food.  My co-worker loves this place, so we go at least once every two weeks.  I on the other hand am not a huge fan of their menu and how they prepare their foods.\n\nAt this place, you order your food at the counter.  Once your meal is ready (under three minutes in my experience), your name is called to pick up your plate.  One can opt to eat either inside or outside on their patio.  There are no trash cans; I leave my food on my table when I'm done...but I'm not waited on by anyone.  Am I expected to leave a tip...?\n\nI have ordered a number of sandwiches and wraps from The Roasting Company.  The presentation of the entr\u00e9es could not be better, however the quality and taste are negligible.  If you order a sandwich or wrap with any sort of sauce on it, you'll find that they include so much of it that your sandwich just falls apart and you make one hell of a mess.  Even on a sandwich without sauce, the chicken is so juicy to the point that the bread will act as a sponge and absorb all of it.  Nothing irks me more than soggy bread.  As for the taste, there is nothing special about their menu; you could make the same items at home (and likely not force yourself to contend with all the sog!).\n\nI give them two stars for their killer sweet potato fries, despite the fact that they only make them on days of their choosing.
4 ||| I love this place! Good for all ages and relatively cheap, a win-win!!\nIf you park in the heritage parking lot they win discount your parking ticket to only $3 bucks and its usually $12! another win!\n\nWe went and checked out bodyworlds and the brain, and if you have never been here, YOU have to go and check it out. Even if you have gone and you know someone who might enjoy it, i think it is the type of place you can go again and see/learn things that you missed your first time through. \n\nWe ended up on level two playing in the kids area( don't be fooled they have pretty cool stuff in there). plus, its o.k to let your inner kid out sometimes. :)\n\nA definite must see, and i won't be surprised if i end up back here again.\nVery cool!
1 ||| Not impressed. The prices here seem to keep going up and up and nothing changes in the store design or layout. Seems dated. Produce could use a makeover.\n\n8 out of 10 times I will drive all the way to Madison to another store.
1 ||| Truth be told, I've never had great BBQ at Memphis Championship and I've eaten at three different locations here in the city. Generally speaking I find most of their meats to be on the dry side and sometimes even cold-ish. Not sure if they have trouble timing thier butts and brisket or just do one batch of meat a day then keep it barely warm? The smoky flavor is always there and the sauces are good enough, just seems to be lacking freshness and expertise, cooking time wise. \n   I went for a quick lunch today with a co-worker and had the burnt ends(Smoky brisket chunks)and the fries and salad. I think I actually go here more because I like the thick-ish friesand crisp side salad and high quality blue cheese dressing more than the meat itself which is kinda sad for a BBQ place. Again the flavorful burnt ends were kinda cold and certainly been sitting a while. This is not a dish that is gonna be fresh and juicy but Ive had these at many superior BBQ places where they retain a bit more moisture. \n The service at Memphis is always quick and rock solid on my visits. Just wish they'd pay a bit more attention to the important thing...the meat.
1 ||| Needs updating badly!  The unit I stayed in had a stove top that was not level and the ice maker in the refrigerator leaked water all over the freezer.  The ice was a big deal since there are no ice machines in the property.  Wont stay here again until it gets a much needed remodeling.
0 ||| !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThursday/10:00pm\n\nI brought my family to this establishment for some \"good\" american food. hostess was nice and sat us. Elizabeth our server took 5 mins to acknowledge us. placed our order: mango ice tea, (2)peach sangria, spinach dip, won ton tacos, cedar salmon and full rack of ribs. My fianc\u00e9 got her sangria but I never received my mango ice tea (strike 1). We asked for more napkins and that took her 10 mins. (Strike 2). for dessert, I actually requested if I can have a root beer float even if it wasn't in the menu and she obliged. Unfortunately, as I was enjoying my float I chewed on leftover salad leaf and chicken!!! (Strike 3).They didn't wash the glasses, utensils and dishes properly. I was so disgusted!!! I wasn't going to say anything and be whatever it happens. So Elizabeth gave us the bill and that's when our patience ran out. she charged us for mango tea that she never got me. She put in a glass of Cabernet and burger sliders which we never ordered. The wonton tacos and spin dip was suppose to be half off and they weren't. That's when I told her I appreciate that she made me the root beer float but I was very disgusted of what I found and had put in my mouth. I even showed her and nothing really happened. Manager didn't bother on coming out to apologize and make things right. they didn't offer anything to fix the situation. So we said f*** it and just fix the bill. We told her but it took her 3x to get it right. Like really?? You fed me dishwasher leftover chicken salad,  neglected bringing us the essentials, forgot my drink and messed up my bill. We were so irritated. Gave us our change without the receipt so we asked for our receipt and they gave us a hard time with that! I work in the industry and I know shady tactics so we demanded for the receipt. (Strike OUT FOR LIFE!) \n\nFYI, We were actually enjoying ourselves and looked pass the forgotten drink and slow neglecting service but it all went to hell after dessert. Yuck! NEVER AGAIN! \n\nI know it's not entirely our servers fault and this place failed as a restaurant. I blame the manager that night. I never saw the manager step out the restaurant. She only went out to override the computers but never checked on floor/tables and customers. The situation could've been turned around. poor management equals poor service and poor work ethic through out the establishment. This restaurant is a disgrace.
3 ||| I've been here since 9/21/14. My first two months have been extremely quiet, people friendly, grounds well kept and bug free. My place is partially upgraded nicely and is fair for the price. I love the location-Zipps Sports Grill, Grass Roots, Butters, Coffee joints, Chipotle, Jimmy Johns, an Indian Restaurant and TCBY. The Green Belt bike path will take you to Temp Town Lake. You rarely are on any roads with cars, so it's safe. 4.5 miles to old town which you can bike the canal. If you are having fun in Old Town, it's an $11 Uber ride. I'm sure there are noisier places in the community, but my place is great so far. Thankfully not many smokers around me either. The last two places which I reviewed were hell on earth in comparison. Oh yeah, the few minor issues I've had were handled immediately.
0 ||| This is the worst wendys i have ever been to in my LIFE, food is ussally sloppy and kinda cold, there is a older pale woman who works the drive threw who is very rude and ive been there couple times she is always in abad mood and rude to everyone, She gets upset when i asked for 2 ketchups she told me last time that the new ketchup packs are 3 in 1, so i told her i understand i want 2 of those she looked at me and put 1 in the bag and closed the window.. so i waited there honking my horn finally someone else came up and gave me my damn ketchup, i tried to contact headquaters on this lady she is the reason why wendys lost my buisness, on top of all that one day i was in the drive threw one of the workers was by the trashcan taking a piss in broad daylight.. cant even imagine what they do behind closed doors
1 ||| Elwood Blues lied to me. After hearing commercials for years on WWHP, where Elwood told me it was incredibly good because they cook on wood, I was eager to try this place. Not a great idea.\n\nIt wasn't terrible, but by no sense of the word was it good Bar-B-Que. It was passable food to fill you up and it was relatively inexpensive, but that's about it. If you need a quick, cheap meal and want some type of meat, this is the place. Especially if the place up the block has a half an hour wait, which apparently it always does. We're going there next time.
3 ||| So I went to a late lunch with the Moms this weekend. \n\n(One plopped me out and the other is her BFF that's been around long before I was doing boom-boom and creating crayon masterpieces on the wall.) \n\nThey wanted salads somewhere downtown. And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.\n\nSo Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.\n\n(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have \"judged a book by its cover,\" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)\n\nSo I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.\n\nEasy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.\n\nIt was salad time. \n\nNow if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.\n\nIs Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)\n\nI'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)\n\nAnybody want to join my one woman campaign?
3 ||| Beer selection was fantastic! Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It's a great place.
4 ||| As with ANY Doctors office...sometimes they run late and you have to wait.\n\nDr Chelsea Crum has delivered two beautiful girls for me and I can't say enough good things about her. She has always been upfront about potential problems or concerns(my pregnancy weight, advanced age) and is more than willing to listen to you as well.\n\nI survived to two c-sections with Dr Crum and couldn't have received better care from her or her colleagues at Scottsdale Shea Hospital. We have a great working relationship and produced two healthy little girls - recommend Dr Crum to everyone.\n\nI have also been served by Dr Deka and loved her too!
3 ||| This is a great deal for the price, and very delicious, too (at least for most dishes). You will get large portions and pay little, if you choose from the a la carte menu instead of the platters. I would recommend getting a few a la carte items. \n\nThe baba ghanooj is my favorite. So is the spinach and lentil soup, which has a very unique taste with lemon juice. So is the kibbe; one of the best I have had ever. So is the halwa bi-jibin (which is dessert made of dough, pistachios, and rose water). There was one point in time I was addicted to this dessert. \n\nThe \"healthy variety\" and \"vegetarian special\" are combination dishes, which are even better deals. I usually replace the hummus in the special with baba ghanooj since I think their baba ghanooj is a lot better. Grape leaves are OK, but the veggie version is  not as good.\n\nThe portions are large enough that if you get three items, you will likely have stuff to take home. And some items (dips) come with pita bread. \n\nI often take out from Ali Baba, and they have always been timely.\n\nMy girlfriend says the open faced hummus pita is excellent, but Ihave not tried it. \n\nThe only bad experience I had: mousakka is not real mousakka. It feels synthetic. Don't even try it.
0 ||| This is unfortunate because, ask me three days ago & I would've given this place 5 stars! Maggie is our favorite bartender around. We live right down the street, frequent the bar often, bring friends, and spend money. However, on the few times we've been in when Jaxx was working, we've noticed that she often seems intoxicated and has never been overtly nice to us...fine...it's a dive bar. But being that we all either ARE or WERE bartenders, we know how customers should be treated and we know how to take care of our bartenders. On one particular occasion, a group of us ordered 6 beers and 6 shots and were charged a whopping $110! A rip-off even by Snottsdale standards! After confronting Jaxx about the bill, an altercation ensued which moved OUTSIDE of the bar and resulted in Jaxx hitting one of our female friends in the face! It's such a drag because we live in the hood and LOVE this bar. Maggie works Wed-Sat nights...I recommend avoiding this place like the plague any other time.
2 ||| I love watching the game at Friday's Front Row. I always wait in line at the hostess station  to get seating right up on the railing. It's a good way to mix up your experience when watching a game at Chase Field. I usually start out the evening at Friday's before I go to my seats.\n\nI much rather have a nice place to sit and eat instead of balancing crap on my lap in the seats. I usually grab a burger and a couple of Coronas. The burgers are just okay but the Coronas seem to hit the spot. I never have any issues with the service. And as other Yelpers have mentioned, you come to Friday's to enjoy the atmosphere, the food and drinks are secondary.
1 ||| Well I came here with coworkers for lunch today and i must say, the experience left a lot to be desired. \n\nThe place seems kinda dusty and dingy when you walk and there an unappetizing looking salad bar/condiment table that you line up next to when you place your order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat. The bun was just a grocery store bun, standard american cheese, a bland under seasoned and overlooked burger. The bacon was great, but that's honestly the only thing I liked here. \n\nThere are better places everywhere you turn with the trendy burger joints popping up a lot in the valley. The fries, which I didn't order but my coworkers did, appeared to be frozen. I just hope for more- get fresh ingredients- make your fries- season the burger. Pass on this place and take your hard earned cash elsewhere.
1 ||| This is in regards to their Events Department - \n\nI had my wedding reception here last year. I complained about the management and received little compensation for all that had gone wrong. \n\nIn the 6 months it took to begin planning my wedding reception to briefly following the reception I had 3 different events coordinators. The first two were amazing, but they left for good reason, the hotel events department was barely a-float. \n\nThere's literally a list of things that went wrong, but the two most concerning: \n1) The hired serving staff (many from temp agencies) didn't do their jobs! \n2) One of the hired staff were high/drunk, and when he and others were asked for help by my family were giving them sass and they still didn't help. \n\nDuring the wedding, all I saw was how things were going wrong. So unfortunately, I didn't enjoy majority of my reception. When you spend all that time planning and spending $$$ and things are being executed half ass or not at all.. it's pretty distressful for an already stressed bride. I complained about this, but it wasn't until I got in touch with Marriott International that anyone called me back. They admitted they were going through many staff changes and apologized for the various incidents. \n\nWhen you spend about $14,000 for SOLELY service and drinks (we catered food). I expect top notch service. My overall bill still had the 22% service gratuity (which they deserved NONE of - which I argued). In the end they reimbursed me $990 which was half the service gratuity. I hate to be ungrateful but that's ridiculous. \n\n\nMy only reason to write this review is because I wish I had known that their events services had gone downhill in past few years. I held an event there in 2010 and the events coordinator at the time, Diana??, and the service were great. People plannng events here should ask the following questions: \n1) Are they still using temps and what experience/requirements do they have?\n2) If things don't go right (which they have someone from the staff on floor during your events - so they can see it themselves), how can they offer compensation or fix the situation??\n\nAt the end - the temps were what were blamed for all the awful service (not clearing plates - my family cleared plates, serving drinks in CANS - when i made it a point everything should be served in glassware, etc...) So that's who I would ask the most questions about. \n\nI hope that things change for the Marriott in the future. They used to be one of the best places to hold large scale events in Madison. In the end, I do wish them the best in getting back to where they once used to be.
0 ||| I recently had some car repairs performed at the shop \"Gregs Japanese Auto\" on Chandler boulevard in Chandler, Arizona.  I have to inform you that I was very unsatisfied with the work performed on my car and can not, in good conscience, recommend your shop to anyone. \n Let me describe to you my experience.   I discovered a coolant leak that appeared to be coming from the back of the engine in my 1991 Nissan 300zx.  I attempted to discover where it was coming from, to no avail. I brought it to your shop to be pressure tested and diagnosed.   I received a call later that day saying that the system was holding pressure just fine and there was no leak. I explained to the technician that I knew there was a leak somewhere because I was constantly having to refill my radiator.  He came back and told me that he tested the system more, it was still holding pressure, however the radiator cap was not.  They replaced the cap, charging me for the cap and diagnosis then sent me on my way with a list of recommended repairs including a few small oil leaks, transmission pan leak, steering and suspension maintenance.  I kept this list for my reference.  \n At this point, I was very satisfied with the service received, so when my clutch pedal dropped to the floorboard later that week I did not think twice about bringing my car in to your shop for repairs. I trusted the diagnosis that the master and slave cylinders for the hydraulic system for the clutch were leaking. While the repair was being preformed, I received a call to tell me that my water pump was leaking and I was loosing coolant.   I questioned how this could be and why the shop didn't catch it when I brought it in for that exact problem mere days before.  He gave me the excuse that it only leaks when its cold, they pressure tested it after it had warmed up and the seals were swollen and therefore held pressure.  This was very careless on on the shops part. The original reason I brought this vehicle in and the original service I paid for was a diagnosis of the engine cooling system. This service was not accurately or appropriately performed or provided. \n Secondly, a mere few days after receiving the car back from the shop after the clutch hydraulic system repair, the clutch began slipping. Now, while it is true that the clutch is a maintenance part that gradually wears out and needs to be replaced, this process can be accelerated by an improper adjustment of the hydraulic system that controls the clutch and I find it far too coincidental that as soon as I had the cylinders replaced and adjusted by your shop, the clutch decided to give out.  I brought this to the technician, and asked him to check the adjustment and inspect the car.  He called me out into the shop to \"show\" me that the hydraulic system was operating properly. What he showed me was that the master cylinder does move when the pedal is depressed.  This information was useless to me and does not prove that it was adjusted properly. He then proceeded to lie to me, telling me that he listed the clutch slipping on the original recommended work list.  I disagreed with him, as I had read the recommended work list that had been given to me and knew it was not on there.  He continued to argue with me, heading back into the office to pull up the document in your computer system, so much for the \"customer is always right\" attitude your shop advertises.   When he pulled it up in the system, and realized I was correct, he did not apologize for his rude and inconsiderate behavior.  The manager (Phil ) merely pushed him out the back door and explained that there was nothing they would do for me because the clutch is a wear and replace part. \n This is unacceptable and I regret to inform you that I will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau and making sure that my friends and the online community are aware of the poor workmanship and service provided by Gregs Japanese Automotive.
1 ||| Did a good job of cleaning but definitely missed a couple of spots that I'm paying for (air vent louvers). Looked to upsell me right away to something that didn't make any sense.
3 ||| (5 stars for late-night food; 1 star for cocktail hour = 3 overall)\n\nWent for drinks with a few girlfriends late on a friday night.  The drinks that the waitress got right were great, but only 2 out of 6 being correct is pretty horrible.  After delivering the wrong drinks (and forgetting to bring 2), the waitress never returned to our table!  We were seated at the table for over an hour watching the waitress flirt with the bartender when we finally decided we would be better off going to the bar to order and pay our checks.\n\nI would love to come back and try the late night menu, which had very reasonable prices and looks wonderful.  However, never making the mistake of going just for drinks again unless I can find a seat at the bar and steer clear of the waitresses.\n\nUPDATE: \nWent back to try the late night menu and the steak sandwich was great, my dining partner had a munster cheeseburger which she loved.  Also, the waitstaff was just fine this time so I am hoping that my first impression was just an unfortunate fluke!
3 ||| My go to spot when I just want to relax with some friends.  Great drinks and craft beer selection is coupled with very good food.  Make sure to checkout the lounge upstairs during those cold winter months.  During the summer grab a seat on either the front patio for people watching, or the back patio for a nice quiet and private drink.  Good brunch turns great once the patios are closed, as the brunch buffet becomes a la carte.  This brings about the Breakfast Smil... err, Simile.  Home fries, bacon, sausage, eggs, and pancakes all on one giant plate.
1 ||| Does this place even have a phone number? I can never reach the damn number. How do we even know if this place is open
1 ||| I find the prices to be too high for the quality of the food. It really doesn't taste that great, especially the pizza. There aren't many places I like to eat in the mall so I only come here if I'm hungry enough.
3 ||| Crackers has been a long term staple for me, held over from my days as a Mesa resident. You just can't go wrong here. \n\nOffering breakfast and lunch, everything on the menu sounds delicious and everything i've had was even better. I'd love to be able to say that i've tried everything, but let's be real here- it's a big menu. \n\nCrackers offers an average of six different soup selections every day, with one or two daily specials. Same with dessert- daily selections may vary. Both are homemade- no boxes or cans here- and they taste like the best thing your mom ever made for you, only maybe a little better. (assuming your mother was a good cook) \n\nThe breakfast offerings are hearty and full of flavor, the lunch offerings run the gamut from light snack to full blown food coma material. Great stuff. \n\nLike Meredith said, the decor isn't anything special- it hasn't changed much in the 15 years or so since  I first ate here. I think they're going for homey country charm. It doesn't matter though- this isn't a place to go for ambiance, unless you're a reclusive Mormon housewife. \n\nCrackers has two other locations- one out in east Mesa and one in Tempe. I haven't been to either of those, but this one is definitely a winner.
3 ||| I like this one much better than the one on Serene. The isles are much bigger, I didn't bump into anyone once!
1 ||| Makeup staff is rude.
3 ||| What a pleasure to have my first NC inspection here!  I was helped promptly, not overcharged for the brake light bulb I needed, and I got to watch HGTV while I waited.
4 ||| lots of Asian inspired stuff. MAKES THIS LIZARD WANT TO TAKE A TRIP TO TOKOYO! \n\nand there's the booze... magnificent. Really breath taking.\n\nReviewer LANAY (how does she live with that name?!?!) should start a blog dedicated to failed expectations.
3 ||| Great, friendly service.\n\nLoved the potato latkes for breakfast.  And the bagel!  Mmmm... I'm a carb girl.
3 ||| Good honest food.   I don't know what I could possibly say that hasn't been said already.   Go and see for yourself.   I'd get the prime rib any day of the week.   The chicken fried pork and chicken is great as well.   Real mashed potatoes and creamy chicken gravy are just perfect.   Try the bread pudding if you have any room left,  but I bet you won't.
4 ||| Greenbush is an institution. Whether you're meeting someone for a drink & some authentic Italian antipasto or you're planning a noisy family reunion with pizza to die for, this inconspicuous basement hideaway has it all. Top it off with a good wine selection & fabulous wait staff that don't pester you, and you might think you're back in Italy for a second. A must-do whether you live in Madison or not.
1 ||| Quite possibly the loudest place on earth! It's so crazy in this place that I can't fault the waiters and waitresses. My girlfriend and I order the same thing every time \"Eggs in the basket, crispy bacon and crispy hashbrowns\" and every time it looks like two different meals?? One's perfect and one looks under done and they always have to bring out my hashbrowns later..I like having my meal served all at once. I don't want to be hard on the staff because it's so crazy in there ...but man..I have a headache when I leave this place...
3 ||| For an international airport, these security lines move super quick! I, also, appreciated the moving walkways to get me around the airport.\n\nShopping selection is average. And pricy. Buy stuff before you come or plan to spend a lot.\n\nAll in all, a great airport.
0 ||| Not impressed by this place at all. The bartenders were not friendly at all and the place looked like a dump. Not suprised since it was off Grand.
4 ||| A 5 star gem!\n\nI echo Jenny D's comment on the hash brown. Super crispy exterior and moist fluffy inside - it's a piece of art.  My friend and I enjoyed the generous portion of scramble egg ($7.50), and 2 layers blueberry pancake ($5.00). Everything tasted like \"mom's food.\" Made fresh to order, and very satisfying. \n\nNo frou-frou typical Middleton gimmick. The basic decore, and the down to earth service - the perfect spot to watch regulars enjoy the hearty breakfast.
0 ||| horrible! my worst drycleaning experience in 20 years in a number of cities. this drycleaner failed at every aspect of being a business. i dropped off our clothes and was greeted by a very apathetic and disinterested counter person. i was told it would take a week before they would be ready. when i went to pick the stuff up, the total cost was $54! the same grouchy woman couldn't find all of my clothes. instead of apologizing or asking me to come back later, she simply went to the back of the store and stayed there. i asked the other counter person if she could please look for the rest of my clothes and i would return later in the afternoon. i went back in the pm and they had apparently closed early that day (no sign or anything to explain why they were closed). i went back a 3rd time to pick up the clothes and the same rude, short tempered woman brought out my clothes and told me the total was $65! apparently the first quote didn't include the laundered shirts. i paid (they only take cash or check by the way) and went home. as i was putting the clothes away, i realized that there were 3 drycleaning items that were not included. i sent my husband back the next day (this is the 4th trip to get the clothes, by the way), and he was told they could not find the remaining items, and that only the manager (who had gone home for the day) could look for them. We are currently waiting for the manager to call us & let us know if the items have been found and/or when i will get a refund for the clothes i paid for them to lose.
1 ||| First time to fly into Phoenix was this past weekend.  Renting a car always seems to be the difficult part, but Sky Harbor has a pretty good system.  There is only one shuttle to the main rental car complex (it's a small airport in-itself) so it's pretty easy to get to the terminals and back.\n\nI didn't get to spend much time in the terminal... I arrived in the morning and had to rush to get into a car and drive to get to my destination... and when I was departing, it was early morning for a 7am flight - (not the hour I am the most observant).\n\nI guess I was lucky... no delays and problems for my trip.  I guess it's bad that I remember my layover airport more than my destination airport.
3 ||| I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? \n\nThe environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. \n\nI really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. \n\nOwners, please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  \n\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. \n\n...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.\n\nThanks!
1 ||| My wife has never been a fan even of the breakfast(like I have always been).\nSo yesterday before Xmas shopping we stopped by for breakfast, and now I have the same feelings she does. To start off they was out of eggs and someone had run out to get them! We sit in the bar area and it was kinda dirty and food just wasn't good and this one hurt cause she always says its not that good and I have to agree now!
0 ||| The decision of Carrie's owner, to encourage the painting of degrading racial caricatures of African-Americans on her store walls this past week has only reaffirmed my feeling that this place is both unwelcoming and attempts to dialog are in bad faith.  While the protests did surrounding the mural did lead to the owner ordering it repainted, I am still deeply hurt and upset that such imagery was even considered allowable, particularly when combined with the store's willingness to sell racist memorabilia, like the Mammy Doll.\n\nI am greatly angered by and disappointed in this place.
1 ||| Other than the atmosphere, I don't have too much positive to say about First Watch.  The eggs were disgusting! They were bright yellow and had the most bizarre texture.  You would have thought they were feeding the chickens fabric softener.  I had a carrot cake pancake, which i thought was a pretty clever idea. Unfortunately, it was multi-grain.  Let me tell you, a multi-grain carrot cake pancake is just a bit too much going on for me.  The service was fair but far from great.   Overall, far from a wow, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. 2.5 stars.
2 ||| They have CLOSED!!!
3 ||| I previously went to this location a couple years ago for a tux and had a good experience. A lot of my friends it seems are now getting married. With having four weddings in a few months I decided it was time to get some new suits. I wear a 52 jacket so your box stores were out of the question as they only carry up to 48. With having a good experience previously, I decided to give Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank a shot. I didn't really care too much for the style of suits Jos. A. Bank had and went to Men's Wearhouse. I got their typical great service as well as a large selection in my size. They had a buy one get one free special on their suits and I ended up getting two suits at a great price. For only wearing suits for a wedding they were a bit expensive but I would shop their more often if I had to wear a suit for work on a daily basis.
0 ||| Worst experience ever! I had four trips to this place in one month..The doctor was trying to juice me here and there.Other then the gal named Crystal the staff was lost and none of them were on the same page.A lot of he said she said going on.I'm going back to Sam's club,never to return!
3 ||| I have only been here a couple of times but I am definitely a fan.  We came up here to meet a friend that was in from out of town.  I love the honey wings and they had some great beers on tap.  We would come up more often if we lived closer.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping in and grabbing some wings.
2 ||| Very average. Good service, friendly staff. Remind me of Mexican places from the 80s that didn't have particularly good flavor, so they just overwhelm you with stuff (guac, sour cream, pico, etc.)
3 ||| I've been coming here for years! Way before the whole renovation to make it look more upscale. I kinda miss the old ways. When they had the fish tanks upfront and you get to pick your fish/shellfish. This place has become the official sobering spot for nightlife people. Food is always good and service is that typical of asian restaurants. Get your food quick, eat it and get out so they can turn that table. They also raised the prices. supply and demand right? Overall, I will keep coming here for good food and they're open 24/7. Don't expect friendly service but fast and efficient. works for me. after a \"pho kim long\" night drinking...nothing beats a large bowl of pho.
1 ||| This is the Domino's that destiny (and my zip code) has assigned me in Phoenix for the past 1.5 years, and like any relationship, we've had our ups and downs. Sometimes things work smoothly, as they should, and other times, not so much. I've seen employees come in from a smoke break and start touching food without washing their hands; I've had delivery show up on time but still somehow warm or cold-ish; and I will bet money that if you call them, regardless of what time of day it is, you will get put on hold. \n\nHowever, my most recent call to them will also be my last. Instead of being greeted by a polite, knowledgeable employee, I was accosted by an angry Latino man whose tone implied I was wasting his time...by calling his job... where he works... to give them money... \n\nAside from his apparent agitation at the mere thought of customer service, he also didn't know the standard ordering procedure that every other Domino's employee throughout my entire life has parroted precisely. Normally, he'd ask a series of questions that would allow me to quickly and easily place my order, but instead he just said, \"You want a pizza, huh? What kind? Like toppings and stuff?\"\n\nYes, sir, like toppings and stuff.\n\nSo, I've come to the conclusion that this store is, even as I write this, being robbed. That was not an actual Domino's employee I encountered, but rather the robber pretending to be one (Fact: this sort of thing happens all the time, as seen in countless movies). I would call the police, but as I'm leaving Phoenix shortly, forever, this criminal and the subpar Domino's he works out, however temporarily, will be out of my life for good.
4 ||| This restaurant has consistently delicious food, no matter what I order. The pho is especially good. It comes in a huge bowl that I can sometimes barely even eat half of. Everything seems fresh and the restaurant could look nicer, but it does look clean. Serving sizes are very large and generous, so you can easily share with the whole table. \n\nFor this type of restaurant, I believe the service is nice, since if you're paying less than $10 per person, you can't exactly expect the same service as a $100 per person restaurant. This is a Vietnamese restaurant and the servers may not be native English speakers, but it is easy to communicate and understand, so don't be deterred. The food is delivered quickly, so we never are left waiting very long.
0 ||| If I could give this place no stars, I would. Worst manicure I've ever had. They upcharged my 13 year old sister kid sister without first alerting one of us the change in pricing. Total rip off, rude service, not even worth going back to get my nails fixed.
0 ||| EW, this place stinks! Literally I don't know what the funk that smell was but it gagged me at the door. I decided to check out the buffet. It looked a mess. Most dishes were overcooked. The Mongolian BBQ had raw beef, chicken, pork and fish sitting out in what I would call a salad bar. The meat looked old and the beef was starting to turn. It wasn't even covered yuck! \n\nI decided I did not want to spend the night in the ER having my stomach pumped so I left. This is a scary place enter at you own risk. \n\nMy taste-buds were spared the torture, I went to Famous Sam's and had some wings!
3 ||| This was our first meal at a restaraunt post plane ride after living in Germany for almost six years. We were excited to get some American-style grub after such a long time. It's a nice cozy little place. We sat down and were served a big cold pitcher of Coke (with ice!). I thought I was going to drown I drank so much. I ordered the chicken quesadillas, my wife and daughter ordered the chicken with chips, and my son got the \"Rodehouse\" burger with Tavern chips. My quesadillas were average(could have done with a little more cheese), but they blew away every \"Mexican\" dish we ever ordered in Germany. The wife and kids seemed to enjoy thier meals and the price was about average. I honestly enjoyed my Coke more than anything else, which must be weird for anyone to hear. If you could give 3 and half stars, I would, because I thought the service was pretty good.
0 ||| Took 25 minutes for them to reheat cold pizza and get it to my friend even though ours took five minutes. We were all finished with our meal by the time they brought him his pizza, only because the security guard overhead us wondering where his pizza was. When we asked what they could do to help us they said nothing. Seeing as we were good customers and the only ones who even tipped we felt rather let down! We will not be coming back to this location. Please be careful their AC leaks right at the register.
1 ||| i used to shop there all the time.  not so much anymore.  his prices have gone sky-high.  much higher than inflation in other stores.  that can't be good for business.  now when i go to food city, which has the best prices on produce, it's crowded with asians.  i wonder if they've stopped going to lee lee's too.
1 ||| There was a rumbly in my tumbly.  And thank goodness it wasn't food poisoning!  I must have been super hungry on the day I went into this China Star.  I'm doing what I can for this place here, but it just wasn't up to par.\n\nYes, it's a super cheap lunch for around $5-6 but remember...you get what you pay for sometimes.  At this China Star it's not much.  The food is decent and you won't have any problems if you've got a strong stomach like I do.  There are your usual dishes like the fried rice, noodles, fried chicken wings, beef and broccoli, and won ton soup.  But I just feel it's all on lower standards.  A lot of the stuff on the day I went was definitely sitting under the heat lamp for a bit, causing a lot of items to be surrounded by a pool of grease.  Ever see coconut chicken after a long bath under a heat lamp?  Trust me you don't want to.  Things tasted rubbery and lackluster.  Soup was cold and the faux sushi was warm.  Wow, and I'm not usually very picky when it comes to eating!  Sad food make me a sad boy.\n\nI'm not usually too critical of the atmosphere either since I've been to dives that were dingy but had good food.  But this China Star over here on Charleston?  It is a bit dirtier than I can accept.  Food bits stuck here and there on the floor, having to clear particles off your seat before you sit down, and sneeze guards looking a little bit questionable?  Aw, come on!  I like my beats fast and my bass down low, but the only thing I like dirty (occasionally) is my lady!  Going to the bathroom is a great gauge on how to tell if a place is clean.  Trust me, going to the bathroom here (which I did) may make you queasy!  There was a roach running around in there.  I tried to ignore it....but yeah, it was still there.  I said hello to it, but it just scurried along its way...probably going back to the kitchen to grab a smoke.  Ack!  I really feel sorry for the ladies that have to actually sit on the seat in the women's restroom.   \n\nThere's not much else I can say about this place for now, I'm getting a bit light-headed thinking about it.  Please, please, please China Star...clean your act up!  This is coming from the guy who loves a cheap buffet and can live with a little bit of uncleanliness.  Live up to your 'A' rating!
3 ||| Want a good sandwich check them out inexpensive beats anything at subway firehouse togos. Service was awesome friendly two guys and a girl. Only thing I wish they had was a haberno sauce sausage sub very good
0 ||| I used to frequent this RA on a very regular basis and absolutely loved it. Always received great service and was seated in a timely manner (even during rush time) \nI just went here with a girlfriend a couple of Fridays ago and it was awful. I would give it one star except I'm hoping this might be a one time thing however many signs indicated it is not. \nThe wait was AT LEAST 30 minutes long, thinking it was worth it we waited, saw some friends and they got sat at a table large enough for us all to sit together so we only waited about 20. We were sat outside after being told there were misters to keep us cool. the misters were about 9 ft high and pointing in the wrong direction so we all sat there in an uncomfortable humid state of sweat. \nWe asked multiple times for extra menus and place settings and did not get them until AFTER our food was served. No soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too. My friend and I ordered sake bombers and they gave us water glasses instead of bomber glasses...they said they kept breaking so they don't provide them anymore. What kind of sushi restaurant does not have the appropriate glasses for bombers? They must be really struggling financially. \nOur server was dull and unenthusiastic, no desire to please. Asked for more water and got it about 15 minutes later. If I wasn't enjoying the company so much I probably would have lost it and asked to speak to a manager. Server also didn't get my friends order right and so they didn't get one of the rolls they ordered until we were almost finished eating. Also they took away the mushrooms in the veggie tempura one of my fav items, big bummer for me. \nWe didn't dare order desert even though we wanted it. All of us are very good tippers and we couldn't even decide if this server deserved a tip. We ended up leaving 15% instead of 20-25%. I considered that very generous. \nThere are way too many new sushi restaurants that contend with RA or are better for me to have any desire to go back again. I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down if they keep up that quality of service.
0 ||| at the annual SPG meetings, the Sheraton Crescent gets the \"most likely to NOT suceed\" review. Couple reasons why this particular sheraton particularly sucks:\n\n1) The elevators, decor, and just about everything else is old and outdated.\n\n2) Wireless internet is 9.99 per device per room per day. Yes, so you have to pay 9.99 for your computer, 9.99 for your ipad, and an additional 9.99 if you want  your cell phone running on the wireless. \n\n3) bathroom was stocked with ONE bar of soap. Thats it. Nothing else. I don't usually like to use that stuff but it's nice to have just in case.\n\n4) parking: you can valet for an additional $10 or park in a sketchy parking structure that's not attached to the hotel. Also note: this hotel is NOT in a good part of town. \n\nI haven't checked out pool or workout facilities yet but my guess is that i won't be too impressed.\n\nGood things:\n\n-Bed is deece\n-New TV
1 ||| Phoenix Sky Harbor is well dominated by US Airways as their main hub in the west. I wasn't here flying US, instead I was on a rather inexpensive United Airlines itinerary. As such, we were relegated to the much smaller Terminal 2. I didn't see much of it as I arrived, busy looking for the way to the rental cars. For the return, I was out of Gate C, which is a warehouse style that serves multiple flights. I was also very late so all I saw was that stuff was mostly closed as I tried rushing through security.\n\nOn the subject of security, Terminal 2 has the backscatter machines and I'm not interested in receiving any more radiation than I already do. My TSO (Transportation Security Officer) was friendly enough as he patted me down and violated my rights.\n\nPHX does not have the rental car vendors attached to the terminal. Instead, you get to take a ten minute shuttle bus ride to the rental car pavilion where they are all represented. It's well off airport, so don't let them lead you into thinking it's close. When you're late for your flight, you really don't want to have to wait FIFTEEN MINUTES for a Terminal 2 shuttle bus while three Terminal 4 buses come and go. Then it's ten minutes to the terminal. This is convenience? I don't think so.\n\nThere are alternatives - if you want zero customer service, you can try flying Spirit into the nearby Phoenix-Mesa airport.
1 ||| Dropped in around 8pm on a Thursday because my friend hadn't eaten here yet. We had to wait 20-30 minutes. The hostess was a pinch rude when I asked where to stand while we waited (everywhere you stand in that place you're in the way!). I got an a la carte veggie taco which was decent, just oily (enough to make me sick).\n\nI think I'm throwing the towel in on you, Cabo. I'll take the 3 miles drive to Plaza to go somewhere worth my money.
2 ||| Bought  a groupon and came late in the afternoon to try it out.  Service was average.  Food was about twice the price that it should be.   The place claims that they have great steaks but there weren't any on the lunch menu.  I had the ribs and they were fair although tony romas would have been better at about a third the price.  The beer was cold and the decor was nice.  The prices were way too high to consider coming back for an average meal.
4 ||| Mmmmmmmmmmm.  I miss having a large variety of sushi restaurants and rolls. \n\nMy kindred spirit took us to her favorite sushi joint in LV and I must say, it's delish.  They had so many rolls I could barely finish reading the list before our waitress came by to take our order.  The fish was fresh, the sauces were creative, and the custom rolls were executed wonderfully.  You will need to try the Kiss of Fire roll which is a combination of spicy fishes drenched in some spicy sauce then topped with a dot of sriacha and a jalapeno.  So good...Most importantly, the prices are wonderful.
3 ||| nothing flashy - just a comfortable fitness environment with generally well maintained equipment and facilities.
3 ||| This is really the only Arcadia area car wash.  They do a great job.  It does take a little longer than the average car wash, but that is because it is all by hand and they do a great job of drying and taking immaculate care of your vehicle.
3 ||| Came here for spring break with the kids. Heard lots of great things, unfortunately the rides were not open just miniature golf, it was fun but hot!! And once that was done nothing else was really left but the arcades and they were just ok. They offered 10$ for 3 hours of arcades but that doesn't apply to all games and it's not worth it. I would like to come back just to see if the rides are any fun. I recommend if the rides are closed don't waste your money.
4 ||| Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing and authentic. I have not had better wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love with the homemade raviolis, (read the directions, these are baked not boiled.) My favorite is the artichoke gorgonzola, they are often sold out. If you're lucky enough, you'll get a chance to see the raviolis being made in action by one of the lovely pasta making ladies. Make certain to use the homemade sauce as well, we're talking heavenly good. Also, if you get there early enough, grab a warm, fresh Tuscan bread, (but maybe I shouldn't be telling you this.) it's crispy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. I dream of this bread. The deli counter is as well fantastic, get some meats and cheeses and have a banging sandwich. Anything you try from here is sure to keep you coming back for more!
3 ||| Helpful staff. Easy to find layout. I'll be back!
0 ||| Wow! Rude employees here. I politely informed the cashier that the turtle flipped on its back. Yeah, I know turtles can use their legs and neck to right themselves up again. But I also know if they can't, they'll die of starvation & dehydration. Point is, not enough room for the turtle with all the other crap in his aquarium. Then upon leaving, the cashier did a \"grrrr\" to her manager like she's the turtle whisperer and we were aggravating her. You work at a Petsmart, you're not a zoologist. I was just a concerned customer. I will never go to this location ever again due to miss tall, short brown hair, pierced nose' attitude.
4 ||| I went to Malinda's Pampered Pets on Saturday for the first time.  My experience there was amazing...they took great care of my dog.  The amount of things they include in their grooming package was great! My dog has never looked so good! The staff was great and listened to exactly how I wanted her fur done...Thanks so much Malinda!!!
0 ||| I was at coffee shop this am asking for an iced vanilla latte which was listed 2nd on their wall menu for $3.55.  Gal told me it was not what I wanted and that the person I was getting it for would not like.  Told me it was only milk and vanilla and I could make at home.  She went to make laughing at me.  Her manager told me that they would be happy to give me money back if I left.\n\nI have been to their concession at John C Lincoln Hospital which is good but will never recommend this rather dirty worn shop to anyone.
0 ||| My fiance and I went to Roland's for a \"date night\".  We were both craving seafood, and had never been here before.  When we arrived, we asked our waitress if there was a happy hour going on.  There was a happy hour and she gave us the menu for it and said she'd be back in a minute to take our order.  The happy hour ended 2 minutes after she gave us the menus, and she came back over 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  Needless to say, we were unable to take advantage of any specials.  We both ordered margaritas for our drinks.  They took a further 15 minutes to come out.  Not only were the drinks weak (and this is coming from a bartender), but one margarita was a substantially different color than the other (despite being the same type).  Additionally, we were charged over $7 apiece for those margaritas that were made with well liquor.  If I'm spending $7 on a margarita, it had either better be tasty or strong (or both).  Anyway, we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer.  We got the Raspberry-maple scallops.  There were cooked well, but served in a watery sauce that removed almost all of the raspberry-maple flavor..  Then we ordered dinner.  We both ordered their broiled seafood medley, which comes with a salad.  I had the caesar salad, although I used the word \"salad\" in the loosest sense possible.  There was lettuce there, but only after I uncovered it from a cup of croutons and a cup of parmesan cheese (not the fresh kind).  I spent about 5 minutes just trying to reach the lettuce in my salad under all that other stuff, and even when I finished I still had more cheese than lettuce.  While we were eating our salads our entrees were brought out, and we had the luxury of watching them grow cold while we finished our salads.  I'm sorry, but when I'm spending $30 on a entree I would like it served hot and after my salad.  Additionally, we were not provided a change of silverware at any point during our meal and I kept having to \"clean\" my fork and knife on a spare napkin.  During our meal I ordered a second drink (beer this time, since liquor is apparently too difficult for them) and had to wait another 10 or so minutes before it was brought out.  I had also run out of water and had to wait 15 minutes before it was even noticed, let alone waiting for a refill.  While there were aspects of this evening that were frustrating, I must say that all of my seafood was cooked perfectly (I just wish I had been able to enjoy my entree while it was hot).  When we had eaten our fill and asked for the to-go boxes, the waitress asked to bring our check.  We still wanted another round of drinks and possibly dessert, but she never asked for either.  Despite the feeling that we were being rushed and she wanted to hurry us along, I decided to order another drink.  In my opinion, it is good manners to make customers feel welcome, relaxed, and not rushed.  We did not feel any of these things.  This was supposed to be our date night and there were just so many little annoyances along the way.  Once again, the food was really well cooked, and if I could have left my tip for the kitchen staff instead of the waitress I would have.  They certainly earned it, and she didn't really seem to care.  Also, while our wait times could be expected during a lunch/dinner rush, there were maybe 7 people in the whole restaurant.  It's not like they were busy.  Our waitress was just too preoccupied with chatting with the other servers (in clear view of our table).\n\nIn short, I do not believe we will be dining here again.  We can get the same quality of food for cheaper and with much better service.
0 ||| Go to a different location !! These people are incompetent and do not own up to their mistakes . They gave me a defective router and when I came back to exchange it , they were in in a rush to close the store and go home . The  associates claimed that their systems were closed and they were unable to exchange the router for a working one,\nThey sent me to another store 40 minutes away from my house instead of fixing their mistake. They charged my account for the same transaction twice, according to them,  I purchased and rented the same router. Now I have to fix up their mess.
3 ||| Not bad. This place is down the street from where I work. The Greek food is actually a little on the bland side. Excellent service. If you go, order the lasagna, it is wonderful.
4 ||| Mamma mia I love pizza.  I am thrilled to say Rosati's is pretty darn good pizza.\n\nThey are super close to where I live, so I popped over there to pick up a phone order that I called in a few minutes earlier.  Their selection of delicious Chicago style pizza is bomb.  I went with the S.O.B. (sausage, onion, and bacon) which was not only fun to eat, but also fun to say. S.O.B...hahaha.\n\nI got a thin crust, which I won't do again.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious; however, they were so generous with the toppings, the poor crust couldn't hold it's own weight which made it super hard and messy to eat.  The flavor of the sauce is great, since it has a bit of a kick.  It has that extra flavor that explodes in your mouth.\n\nSo here is why it is nicked one star.  I picked up the pizza and the guy at the counter said \"We have a punch card. Do you want one?\"  \n\nI said, \"Yeah, sure!\"\n\nHe said,\"Well we don't have them right now.  I don't know when we'll get them back.\"\n\nI was like...\"Uh, ok.\"\n\nWhy did he offer one in the first place?!  I would have loved a punch card, but you can't just offer a girl a punch card then not give it to her! Sheesh.\n\nShenanigans aside, I love this place.  I love me some pizza.  I'm going again, and soon.
2 ||| I went to this mall in search of a birthday dress once and I left empty handed. If you're looking for fair and low end prices, I wouldn't even suggest looking at this mall as you drive by. I'm the type of person who looks for deals and appreciates low prices, so when I searched high and low for the perfect \"turning 21\" dress, I was ultimately disappointed. But, to be honest, the stores had very nice selections of clothing and I did find some great dresses for you females wondering, but all at $100 and above. Overall, this mall is for the big spenders and I'm sure they'll walk out with many bags!
4 ||| Cool bar in a scary location. Great bartender, neat atmosphere, great dive bar. Marked down for sketch walk to/from parking lot.
1 ||| Unfriendly little place.   Big sign on the door --- check backpacks and large purses.   I can get with that --- I understand that they need security.   So I walked up to the counter and asked for a tab for my purse.   No tab system --- was told to just leave it on the counter!   I couldn't believe it!   My purse had money and my passport in it!   They're so worried about stuff being ripped off from their store --- but they appear not to be worried at all about handling their client's important items.   I had to insist the guy put it behind the desk!  \n\nFollowing that, we found the clerk who helped us to be the epitome of bored and blas\u00e9   We're from out of state --- used to friendly (and secure) treatment from Daniel Smith Art Supply in Seattle.   These folks need to take some customer service classes there --- and while they're at it, maybe they could turn the lights up --- we went in at about nine am and the store was gloomy and dark.  \n\nThe only reason I'm giving this a two star is because we actually did find what we wanted.   The supplies seem fine --- but the clerks need to go to a customer service training course.
1 ||| The burger was alright. The online menu prices and the real menu prices do not match up. They can be up to 4-5 dollars different. The cheese curds were.... weird. I can't place my finger on it but would not buy them again. I got sweet potato fries and my friend got normal potato fries. Both the normal size and yet my friend got about twice as many fries as I did even though I had to pay extra for sweet potato fries. Personally probably wouldn't go again.\n\nFood was meh. Service was meh even though there were only three groups of 2 in the entire place.
2 ||| This store is pretty small.  I went in looking for some large lobster clasps.  When I walked in there were 2 ladies sitting at a table in the back, possibly a class.  One of them popped up and asked if there was anything she could help me find.\n\nShe directed me to a section in the back where the findings were on display.  It wasn't a very big selection and they didn't have what I needed.  I looked around a bit more and didn't see anything that interested me.\n\nThere was a very large selection of seed beads.  If that's what you're in the market for this place might be of more help to you than it was for me.
2 ||| The bar and restaurant has nice decor. Very upbeat. The calamari was good but not exceptional. The Chaing Mai curry was so spicy hot I couldn't eat it. The service was unattentive.  Has potential but presently over rated.
0 ||| I give them one star for being open. Other than that...service was horrible, they ran out of the pasta for the dish ordered and a roach measuring almost three inches ran across my friends foot then up the wall behind the wine bottles. The manager just moved us to the table next to where we were sitting. Oh and did I mention the restaurant was empty!  Needless to say I will never go back to this neighborhood restaurant.
4 ||| Great atmosphere and great food! Love this place, always a favorite experience when visiting the area. I understand they close every year for 1 week for deep cleaning and general sprucing up (I make sure I don't visit the week after Christmas as to miss eating there.) Every restaurant should do this. I would always recommend The Courier Cafe!
4 ||| Probably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!\n\nI first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  \n\nThe only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P
0 ||| Visited on 10/11/14 and will never return. It took forever for our waitress to even acknowledge us and ask for drink orders. We told her we were ready to order which we did but she wrote nothing down and asked us immediately after for the order again. Use paper and pen next time girl. THEN while waiting FOREVER for our food we hear her cussing the cooks out regarding our order and she stated that her tip will now be fu*%ed because our food was late. LOL smh. We asked for more water twice and more bread. She brings the water pitcher and leaves it on our table??? No bread. After 30+mins we asked for a manager. The manager comes with our food but tells us \"I wanted to wait a few more mins for your order before coming over to you\" Smh once again. The manager told us that our meal was comped and offered dessert to which we declined. We just wanted to get out of there. We should've paid attn when we walked in because the manager was walking a familiy out apologizing for the bad service. I wonder how many tables had comped meals that night. The food is less thatn mediocre and the staff sucks. The only person who seemed to care was the hostess.
3 ||| \"I Love the food... The Bread.. Hellllloooooo...:O) Spring Mix Salad My Fav. I have to say Thank Goodness... SOOOO OVER OLIVE GARDEN!!!SO SICK OF THE CHAIN FOOD ! YUCK! But... I Do have to say, there IS some servers there I Do Not care for, and request others... But I will still go there when I want some Awesome Italian Food...\"
0 ||| Ordered a bean, cheese and rice burrito and they gave me a bean and cheese.  I don't speak Spanish,  I shouldn't have to, but it seems they only employ Spanish speakers. I'll go to tacos El Gordo from now on. This is the 3rd time, I'm done. Called to complain and couldn't understand a word they said. I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend. Learn to speak English.
0 ||| 15 miles from the Las Vegas strip this place claims to have Iowa Pork Tenderloin Sandwiches and since it's been more than 5 years \nsince we had one we were determined to make the drive. When we arrived it looked very promising a large crowd was gathering next door for the car show and once we entered the place had a very cool atmosphere with \nTV's on every wall,classic 50's \nboothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus \ntheres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the \ninterent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a \nwaitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn't leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 \noccasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said \"it's crazy in here\" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we've waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you've ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the \natrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait. IF you are looking for a disrespectful smart mouthed teenager to give you SHIT this is your kind of place. BUT if you expect to get what your paying for Quality Food & Service you MOST definitely will NOT find it here.
4 ||| This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so, but the staff doesn't have an attitude, they just aren't into serving.  And I'm not a vegan, but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. The menu is also huge.  \n\nFor those of you looking for an ATM- there's one a half block away if you just exit, go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.\n\nI could always find a table and spread out with my books. Comfy, young, hip, worth it.  I wish they had alcohol.\n\nTry it!
2 ||| I went outside for several minutes and waited on the benches while my clothes were drying, and I came back in to discover that my laundry bag was thrown in the trash and my $13 detergent bottle was put in their lost and found. I could understand if it had been sitting their all afternoon, but seriously it hadn't even been some 15 minutes and there were barely any customers there. So it couldn't have been more obvious who they belonged to. And to think, this has happened twice now.\n\nI'll admit the place is clean, but they are also very expensive. Then again, I guess throwing away my laundry bag is part of the cleaning process, and having to buy a new one only adds to the expense of washing my clothes. Real logical.
0 ||| Nothing much has changed here.  I needed a specific product and tried to call the store, no answer.  As it was just after 5 PM on a Saturday, this was possible, but they are close-by and I took a chance.  When I got there I found the store open, empty except for the salesgirl, who was staring out the front window while the phone rang off the hook.  When I asked why she didn't answer the phone she got snotty.  Then when I asked for the product she said \"This store doesn't carry that stuff\".  I left with no purchase and a vow I will not return here!
0 ||| THIS IS THE WORST AIRLINE IN THE ENTIRE FREE WORLD.  THEY DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORKS \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\".\n\nAt all costs, use another airline or be prepared to have your flight cancelled or delayed and receive extreemly rude and abusive treatment from \"Customer Service\" represenatives.
0 ||| Rude and unprofessional staff. I had my cart dissembled and received no apologies. I would expect much better customer service in Whole Foods since the store has higher prices compared to other groceries. However, I have never experienced such cart thievery by staff in other grocery stores, even after leaving cart alone for a while.\n\nI left my cart and went to the deli where I waited for deli lady to tell me ingredients and price of the pizza dough; it took her much longer than I expected. When I returned to place where I left my cart, there was none. I asked pink-haired bakery lady if she's seen it, but she didn't. When she asked cashiers, little Asian guy admitted that he dissembled it and returned my meat and cheese to the departments. No apologies. Bakery lady didn't say anything either. Wow, what a great customer service!\n\nI had to go back to the meat department and ask for my meat, explaining the situation. Meat guy said that it was probably done, so food wouldn't be stolen. Now I was accused of potential stealing. How the food sitting on the cart can be stolen?! On top of that, they sold my ground beef package, so I had to wait for new ground beef to be grounded and then packaged for me for 20 minutes. Again, no apologies were given.
4 ||| Cute, trendy clothes. The quality is much better than xi. Always sales going on.
3 ||| Totally unexpected find in Gilbert. After driving passed this place for 5 years and not giving it a 2nd thought, I finally drove around to the entrance on the back side of the building. The show room was something else and the staff couldn't be more relaxed and knowledgeable about their extensive collection of furniture. No high pressure sales people - just folks find the right furniture to meet your needs - seemed more interested in building a long term customer than getting a quick sale.
4 ||| I enjoy taking the family here for special occassions, love the upscale atmosphere and\u00a0so\u00a0far never had a bad dish. The specials are usually interesting but make sure you know the pricepoints on those as I once had a surprise.\nEspecially love the veal dishes..........
0 ||| The service was pretty spectacularly poor. There was one server for the entire pub and while it was relatively slow we rarely saw our server.  After waiting 40 minutes for a pizza we inquired as to the status of our food, for which she gave us attitude, and later emerged to tell us the pizza just went in the oven. When it finally arrived it was decent, definitely not bad, but also not worth an hour+ wait. This place is good for a big group of people who are there to drink and content with appetizers arriving....eventually. But for a couple out to dinner, avoid it.
0 ||| Wow, so bad. We just went here for dinner, and though we rarely write reviews, we feel like we want to save others from eating here. Really, we can't believe there are any positive reviews. \n\nA few positive aspects: it is inexpensive (they let you order the lunch specials for $1 more at dinner time). Also, the waitress was very nice... so nice that we're sorry we didn't like the food.\n\nHowever, these positives cannot change the fact that the food is cheap & gross. It tastes like a bad quality Chinese buffet. The meat & vegetables used were poor quality, the sauces were bland and the fried foods were over-fried. Even the fried rice was no good.\n\nWhen we eat out we expect the best quality food and we didn't get it here. We will keep looking for a decent Chinese place to eat in Chandler.
1 ||| We used to eat here quite often (2-3x per month), and have tried just about everything on the menu.  Lately the dishes have just not been as tasty.  Also, tonight when we went there, the portion sizes actually got smaller.  When 2 people are eating for $18.xx, I expect to have enough food to fill me up.  \n\nWe are both active people, so we eat a fair amount, but we usually have leftovers unless we share a dish.  On this occasion, I left hungry after we shared 2 dishes.  We asked the server about the portion size and he assured us \"everything is weighed\".  The part omitted, presumably, was \"now we measure out less\".  Another diner also complained about portion size while we were there.  This place is emptier every time we visit.  Doubt we'll go back again.  Sorry Pei Wei, seems like you have run your course.
1 ||| Stopped At Sticker Place Inside The Mall, Asked The Young Man Running The Booth For Two Bumper Stickers ($20). As He Was Making The Bumper Sticker I Stopped Him Because I Felt He Misunderstood What I Wanted In A Bumper Sticker. So He Hits Me With \"That Will Be Another &10 Making It $30.\" We Get Into A Debate On What A Bumper Sticker Is. Then He Says To Me \"Im Sorry You Dont Know What You Are Talking About.\"  I Get Upset With The Smart Ass Comment And Ask For A Refund. An Argument Starts, He Is Cursing At Me & I Am Cursing At Him. He Reluctantly Refunds Me My Money Only After I Threaten To Call Mall Management. He Keeps Talking Trash The Entire Time He Is Refunding My Money And Also As I Was Trying To Walk Away. Another Argument Starts Until Security Shows Up. Welcome To The Hood That Is Mills Mall. Ghetto.
4 ||| After living in Pittsburgh for 5 years, I finally made a trip to the zoo today. Overall, it was a good trip. I loved the Zoo and seeing all of the animals out wandering around. My friend and I took her two boys, who had a blast. They particularly enjoyed the elephants and the monkeys. \n\nWhen we got to the aquarium, I was honestly a little surprised. I've read such rave reviews and heard such amazing things about it, I was disappointed. I was expecting something a little larger, perhaps a little more interactive. Compared to the New England Aquarium in Boston, this was something of a let down. I was looking forward to seeing the shark tank, but when we got to that part, there were only two sharks.\nThe penguin habitat and the stingray area were both great! The penguins were playful. It was awesome to hear squeals of delight from all the kids in the room when they would dive into the water or swim right by at eye level. \n\nI have the impression that today seemed to be something of an off day, from my friend, who has been there before, and also from overhearing some comments of other patrons. I will definitely be giving the zoo another chance. \n\nOne more thing, if you have little boys, buy a ticket for the train and take them. It's a short little ride, but so worth the joy they get from riding a \"real\" train!
2 ||| -Fancy salad place.\n\n-Salads are very yummy.\n\n-Parking is a pain in the butt.\n\n-Pricey for lunch.
2 ||| Would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place.  Ordered a milkshake at 7:59, by the time it arrived it was after 8:00. They are offering their half price shakes after 8:00. Even though it was delivered after 8:00 they wouldn't give it to me at half price because I ordered it one minute too soon.  I hate lazy workers who don't want to be bothered making things right for a customer.
1 ||| I was a customer of Poor Boy for over 15 years and was always very satisfied with their termite treatment where they would drill and trench the entire exterior of the home.  I had this treatment done 3 times, each 4-5 years apart as it was totally effective for that length of time.  In October 2012, I paid them for another treatment, but noticed this time they used infrared thermal imaging and only \"spot treated\" in the walls and other locations that they found evidence of termites.  This treatment was guaranteed for a year and needless to say, I had termite evidence and damage within a few months.  They came out and treated the same way (for no charge since it was guaranteed), but back came the termites!  After one year, I was given the option to pay for an extended warranty, but they would not agree to treat with any other system.  In my opinion, this latest thermal imaging technology is NOT EFFECTIVE at all!  Don't waste your money as termite treatments are expensive, and the damage the termites cause can be even worse!!!!  Better to find someone that uses the good old drill and trenching treatment!!!
3 ||| Okay, my review sums it all up in a text that I sent to my boyfriend several hours after eating a Frisco Burger w/o tomato, small order of curly fries and a small diet coke.\nText message:\n\"Don't tell anyone but I ate at Hardee's today and it was like real restaurant quality. Well just the food part. I didn't eat it all b/c 1) I couldn't and 2) I wanted some for later.\"\n\nI was driving while eating it and I kept saying out loud how good the burger was. Mind you, I was totally alone. And I didn't go in the restaurant but it looked clean from the drive-thru window and that woman who took my order did a better than average job. I was kind of put off by their prices but it was totally worth every penny!
2 ||| I've talked about the concept of \"vaguely Asian\" in other reviews, but seeing as how they're for places a continent away, I'll honor you desert-dwellers with a phenomenon my fellow Atlantans suffer through on a nigh weekly basis: the Crazy Ivan.\n\nBack to \"Vaguely Asian,\" it can apply to many things: food, restaurants, movies, Olivia Munn on \"Attack of the Show.\" Mostly it's the practice of mixing up benign stereotypes in a way that satisfies one's notion of location or expectations while not actually being accurate at all.  For example, I've eaten at countless barely passable \"Chinese\" joints in mall food courts that, other than their liberal use of soy sauce (mostly manufactured in Southern California) are technically about as Chinese Hong Kong Phooey.  But it's just Asian ENOUGH to satisfy most people.   Now when I say \"most people\" I don't mean those Japanophiles or Sinophiles or anybody with enough yellow fever that they get all huffy when you include Kurosawa in with Woo or any other of the Hong Kong oeuvre.  Oh, and Asians too. I assume \"vaguely Asian\" probably isn't enough to satisfy most Asians of which I am one though only vaguely.\n\nHowever, Asians themselves can be faulted for this feeding into the Vaguely Asian experience.  I used to frequent, only because of its proximity to my office, a terrible Chinese place that served sushi but was run by a Vietnamese guy.   Add in a few Korean waiters and me, the Filipino customer, and it was the Pacific Rim of Crapitude.  It was as if thousands of years of pan Asian culture had been boiled down into a single crucible of misery and suck represented by rubbery lo mein and rice not fit to be given out by UNICEF. And yet curiously, I found comfort in all this. It was all so pleasantly vaguely Asian.\n\nThen again, my mother sometimes complains that I'm too American for her taste.\n\nAnyway, I knew all this when I went to Pei Wei. I didn't expect much in the way of authenticity. Actually I didn't expect ANY authenticity. I expected a lot of rice, soy sauce and ginger in odd places. I expected Vaguely Asian and, well, that's what I got. OK, it's not quite to the whitewashed level of say, a Panda Express, but I sure as hell ain't gonna find any chicken feet boiling away here.\n\nThe space was nice. Nods to authenticity if not attempts to actually meet it. (Unused) woks hanging decoratively from hooks, dark woods and the obligatory chopsticks which, really, are impossible to eat with unless the rice is sticky.  The set-up is fast casual which indeed is fast, but always puts into question whether to tip or not.  Dishes range from \"Thai\" to \"Korean\" to \"Chinese\" and, well, they're really not any of the three, but it's good enough for government work.  I kept thinking to myself, \"Man, this is like visiting a poor man's P.F. Chang's,\" when lo and behold, I discovered it WAS a poor man's P.F. Chang's as in, they're sister chains. Ah so, Grasshopper.\n\n In all, it wasn't HORRIBLE per se. The food was edible if not impressive. Since none of the dishes were over $10, the prices weren't that bad. The many, many, (sigh) many kids around me seem to be digging it.  The service was perky (though the cashier made me feel older than McCain's grandpa.) Finally they had Sapporro in large bottles which helped me to handle the many, many, (sigh), many kids around me.  So if your knowledge of China is less Sun Tzu and more General Tso, then you'll do fine here. I'll give it 2.5 stars and round up because, hey, I'm visiting.
4 ||| The service at Blue Fin earns all the stars, as far as I'm concerned. There are other equally tasty (and in some cases more flavorful) places to grab a rice bowl. The service is outstandingly hospitible though; so, you can't help but leave Blue Fin with a warm fuzzy feeling toward your hosts!
0 ||| I have never been to a restaurant as loud as Four Peaks, at least on a Wednesday evening before 6pm.  The room was about half full but the volume of noise was so great that I literally could not talk to my companion without leaning over.\n\nSo we left without ordering.\n\nI think not being able to tolerate the environment is reasonable grounds for one star.\n\nIf you don't mind noise, the food might be good.  I'll never know.
3 ||| Can't say much for the food as I only had a beer. As for the beer, they list having 'many, many more' types of beer on draft after listing Bud, Bud Light, Miller, one hefe, and one other lager. Really do I have to go the bar and look? And the waitress doesn't know? And then my 16oz is served in a plastic cup. And this Hooter's must have the highest concentration of pregnant servers. I saw two of 'em.\n\nDidn't help I saw the Giants get creamed. At least the Niners won though.
4 ||| Einsteins has these GREAT Lo-Cal thin bagel breakfast  under 300 cal.  The one I tried had mushrooms asparagas with swiss cheese and egg white and a yummy sauce. Large  Iced non fat sugar free latte perfect way to start my day after a work out!! Very friendly employees!!  Very FAST service!! They also handed me a bunch of coupons to come back.  VERY Impressed. Total bill a little over $9.00 but now I have some 2 for 1 coupons!!
3 ||| Hands down best Pad Thai around.
0 ||| My friend and I made an appointment and still waited 15 minutes after we arrived. 2 of the women were rude and one even said my friend asked for the scrub when she didn't and still charged the extra money for it. Never going back!
1 ||| I just called to try and buy a dark side of the moon t-shirt and they do not do stock checks? So, I have to drive 45 minutes, attempt to park in Union Square in SF and they might not even have what i need? No thanx, i'll find a store with better customer service to buy it from
3 ||| For the most part, the atmosphere, food, service and location are up to snuff. I always enjoy the Picnic Salad but the grilled cheese sandwich was a major disappointment.
0 ||| Be very careful with your bill!!! Check it and check your change! Three times consecutively I have come here grabbing pick up delivery after work and the same guy always seems to \" accidentally \" add something to my order and \" accidentally \" short me $1 from my change... Really?? Mind you I'm coming to the restaurant at 3-4am... I have a feeling he can get away w/ this since most people eating at this time are drunk or w/large group of people. A dollar here, a dollar there.. That adds up. I feel like he's trying to tip himself..
4 ||| I'm a sucker of a good lunch deal.  They have signs all around the plaza for $5.99 gyro combo (gyro+drink+fries or Greek Salad). The gyro was decent but nothing special.  I actually enjoyed the Greek salad more.  It was fresh with the basic cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese.  The dressing was drench yummy goodness. \n\nThey have TV's mounted on a few walls. There are plenty of tables for large groups.  Just a note, at times the service can be slow since they have one person entering the order, cashier, and serving.  \n\nThe light rail project on 19th Ave is really hurting many small businesses.  I like to support neighborhood business. I will definitely return to try the other menu items.
4 ||| Price's is one of the few places in Charlotte where you can find a cross section of every demographic within the Queen City. There's a reason why this spot has been in business for as long as it has, the food is great. Price's has been featured on the Food Network as well as major print publications and there isn't anywhere in the Metro Area that you can find a better Fish Sandwich. ENJOY!!!!!
1 ||| Don't send your kids to any of their summer programs. My daughter (6yrs old) went and had a terrible experience, and we ended up just pulling her out. They spent the majority of their time just in a room supervised by a couple of girls just left to play with the toys there or do whatever. We weren't happy with it at all.\n\nGiving them 2 stars just because the club itself looks nice.
0 ||| Avoid this airport. Had a connecting stop here on our way back from Mexico and hated every minute of it. Had to collect our bags and go thru security again was a huge pain in the rear. After that no real food in the entire E concourse. Creepy bathroom attendants handing out Listerine and mints. Over crowded tiny gates with no place to sit or charge a phone. Any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere. CLE, PIT, ORD, LAS, LAX, PHL even ATL is better than this shack of an airport.
3 ||| This is always busy.  It is quality food done quickly.  The rare beef and special combo pho is always a winner.  \nWife loves #24 grilled chicken salad w/vermicelli and egg rolls.  4 year old son kills the egg rolls by himself.
3 ||| Excellent food. Not pretty and I wish they would invest but it is clean and has a friendly staff. Food is fresh and excellent!
4 ||| Great little find in Scottsdale for Kids Resale and fun stuff for Mama's too!\n\nWorth the drive from Goodyear!\n\nGreat deals, clean shop, very organized, kind owners.  :-)
1 ||| Cafe Luna looks like a whorehouse from the outside, because it's in a long brick building lined with small windows and from the outside, the indoor lighting looks skanky. With that said, I like the lighting. The inside decor is just... trying too hard, and I never use that phrase. The silky pillows that match the walls do not work. \n\nAnyways, we ordered fried goat cheese balls, which was probably the best thing all night. The artichoke with brie sauce was a nice concept-- pluck off the leaves and dip in the little bowl of sauce that is the artichoke-- but the leaves barely had any meat on them, and were soggy and not very flavorful. My mom thought the artichoke had been frozen. The sauce, however, was very good without being too fondue-like. I ended up dipping bread in it. We also got the beef tenderloin, which was decent. It had a surprising heat... it wasn't even really spiciness, it was heat on the tip of my tongue and maybe once through my nose, but not a lingering hotness in my mouth. I thought it was similar to wasabi. It came with potatoes and onions that were perfectly cooked but plain. The cilantro-lemongrass pork rib was my favorite next to the goat cheese. The cilantro and lemongrass aren't very noticeable, in fact the flavors are kind of in the background. What I tasted was the meat, which was falling off the bone and really yummy. The creamy clams were gross. The sauce was pretty tasty, like a good alfredo, but the texture of the clams wasn't quite right. I thought they were too chewy and my friend didn't like how when she bit into them there was a lot of squirting action. The duck confit was a disappointment. The au jus (which I thought was chocolate at first... whatever) was really salty and the duck was just alright. My mom and friend really liked it, though. For dessert we had the cheesecake, which was very good and had fresh berries on it. \n\nThe food was hit or miss, and I would probably go back here with specific tapas to avoid if it weren't for the awful service. Our waiter only came around to take our order, refill an iced tea once, give us the check, and come back to get the check when we were standing up and putting our coats on. We were always given our food by different people, and had to ask them for refills and such. I don't know why he wasn't more attentive, and I don't really care either... he got a shitty tip. Oh, I thought the prices were really good. We got all of that for fifty-five bucks. Cafe Luna just needs more polish on their food and better trained waiters.
0 ||| I had the fish fry last sat November 21, 2014 and got food poisoning. I was there at 830 pm and felt sick about 15 mins after leaving.  Throwing up fish, living by the toilet and not getting paid for 2 days work is what i suffered.  I was sick for 3 days and needless to say  I will never eat there again!!!!
4 ||| My husband and I love Del Taco. The burritos and grilled chicken tacos are good. The ingredients are fresh (for a fast food spot) and it isn't expensive. Not too mention they're open 24 hours!
2 ||| Let me explain the 3 stars. I know the place is corporate, mundane and not all that exciting. However, when I first decided that I would be moving to Tempe it was inside this Chili's. That was more than a decade ago, but I know that I made the right decision in moving here.\n\nThe food at Chili's is worth 2 stars. The ambiance, maybe 2 as well. But at least mill ave is walking distance afterwards. The location of this Chili's is pretty good. But there are much better places to eat in the surrounding neighborhood.
0 ||| i called them and they wanted to charge $30 for fingerprints!!!!!  What a joke.  I found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for $10.  Caveat Emptor!  If if could give them a zero rating, I would have.\n\nOn the other side of the airpark off of Greenway-Hayden loop is Global Pi Security.  $10 for prints. Their address is 7807 East Greenway road, suite 9, Scottsdale, Az.  globalpi-security (dot) com.  Good luck.
4 ||| Trader Joe's is a typical Cali-influenced grocery store. I fell in love with them on the West Coast, then found myself going less and less when we got locations back in my hometown in Texas. Now I barely go, but when I do it's for specific TJ items!\n\nFor starters, I love their floral section by the entry- they usually have good pricing. Today was no exception; tulip bouquets for $3? Score! Need to keep this place in mind when I need flowers.\n\nProduce can be very hit or miss, I find them to be pretty overpriced.\nFrozen section has a lot of scores for people who don't really know how to cook, or who want some help for their side dishes: their chicken potstickers are a steal at $3/bag, and they're super easy to heat and eat. They also have a chicken gorgonzola dish that is pretty bomb.\n\nRecently they've added a fresh juice section- today I grabbed a bottle of carrot juice, also available in organic for about a buck more. I may have to go back and stock up.\n\nLots of snackable foods in the rest of the store, from cracker-cut cheeses and goat cheese samplers in dairy, to more varieties of tortilla and pita chips than you can shake a stick at (including the pumpkin seed and cranberry variety that I love!). Refrigerated cases have just about every hummus under the sun (eggplant is my favorite), and of course there's the wine section as well.\n\nTJ's three buck Chuck in the Cab is good, but I don't think I've ever gone wrong blindly picking from the aisles either. There's a sparkling red that's good too, I think it's by Romano vinyards? No clue, but it's delish and $5, which might narrow down your search. It has a champagne-type cork and is on the last aisle by the chips.\n\nService is stellar, too. Crew members are stocking shelves and stopping to answer questions without seeming bothered, cashiers open up as soon as they notice a line, and they're without a doubt the friendliest (and best-compensated, in terms of pay and benefits) grocery workers I've encountered compared to any other chain.\n\nSide note, I still haven't tried the cookie butter, but the regular, crunchy, and cocoa were all in stock this afternoon.
4 ||| I like fast Mexican food and out of all the corner taco shops this has been by far my favorite..  Always fresh and hot off the grill/fryer it's one that I frequent regularly :)
4 ||| Really delicious, really fast, reasonably priced, consistent, friendly, and efficient service.  This was probably the thirtieth or fortieth we've eaten there and we'll be back many more times.
4 ||| Blooming onion was a grease pit. The burger was over cooked and dry. It also had a tomato but instead of a nice red slice of tomato. The waiter acted like he could not be bothered with the complaint. It was difficult to get refills on drinks. The manager acted like he didn't care. Why has this chain not closed yet with its 19th ' menu. I will say the place was clean. Although I have seen cleaner bathrooms in a gas station.
4 ||| Living in New York City, it's actually quite difficult to get good Taiwanese food. There are only a few select spots and and most of them are in Flushing or in New Jersey. Yikes. Rose Tea Cafe blows most of these spots out of the water. Most of the Taiwanese specialty dishes here are done very well, like the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (Three Cup Chicken) which comes out sizzling in a clay pot and with tons of garlic and basil. The shredded pork with bamboo, salt and pepper pork, and the ganbian string beans are also my go-to dishes here too. The portions are great, and I usually always end up bringing extra food home.\n\nI'm a fan of the lunch specials as well, and at those prices ($5-7), definitely a steal. My favorite is the pork chop over rice with a hard boiled tea egg. Pretty much everything is better with that tea egg. Definitely a good value if you want a hearty, high-quality meal on a college student's budget. \n\nThe milk teas and the smoothies are always better here, definitely better than Orient Express or Lulu's Noodles, likely because the ingredients are fresher and I just feel that they have more experience making these great drinks. I never really drink bubble tea anymore, but in all the years I've been going to Rose Tea, it has never disappointed.\n\nService is actually pretty good here, minus the actual seating part. The host/hostess always struggles with seating people efficiently, but the actual waitstaff is always pretty friendly and attentive, something that isn't common among some Asian restaurants. Service can become a little spotty when it's super busy, but it's never been enough to ruin our experience.\n\nOverall, Rose Tea is a place that you'll see a lot of Taiwanese students/patrons at, and I think that's a testament to their authenticity and quality. The food, drinks, and better-than-average service should keep you coming back for more.
1 ||| Pretty basic, came in randomly on a sunday so we caught the church crowd, we were able to get one of the last tables and a line had formed just behind us. While entering i said to my girlfriend... i hope they arent just 8 or 10 dollar omeletes. Haha well that was most of their menu, but it was ok, some people need that variety. I only had the country scramble or somethin.\nGirlfriend was excited for the pumpkin bread but didnt eat half of it, not sure why.. only thing she liked was the feeling of the place, small, open, blackboard specials. Did not feel Las Vegasy AT ALL, more like a place in the mid west that would be on Diners Drive Ins and Dives.\n\n\nDef not the best so not much to say. i'd come back if i was in the mood.. maybe... ok i think i need to give this place a 2nd chance now i feel mean !!
1 ||| Yes, the coffee is decent, but the service has been repetitively so abominable, that I now forgo the joe in the morning at the Odana shop, even if I'm dying for a good cup, I just can't deal with the service.\n\nOne easy example, a guy who works there once was on the phone when I gave my order, a personal call. He took my order, rang it up incorrectly since he wasn't paying attention, twice. The order was for a hot chocolate and a decaf - which has to brew independently.  After! the call ended and he rang me up, he THEN! started the hot chocolate. Then, after the hot chocolate was finished! he started the decaf. This was about 7 minutes into the beginning of my order. Then, with hot chocolate in hand, I waited over 5 for the decaf to brew. The whole time too he was chatting with someone about politics and I\"m not sure exactly how long the decaf really took.\n\nThis is how it should have gone: No phone call, DUH, the second he heard \"decaf\" he should have set it up to brew, then returned to ring me up. Then finish with the hot chocolate, so it would still be hot while the decaf finished, hand me two drinks in a reasonable 4 minutes, not 12. Horrible.
3 ||| They only accept cash here!! Of course we saw the sign AFTER we ordered. \nConveniently they have an ATM right inside the restaurant. Hahah. \nThe MN girls and I are walkin' around China Town and it's time to pick a spot and get some grub! We decide on Sam Woo. \nWe got salt n' pepper calamari, beef chow fun and some kind of wonton soup. \nHunnie Bunnie really liked the chow fun. I loved the salt n' pepper calamari and the MN girl Donna thought the wonton soup hit the spot! \nThey also hook you up with some complimentary hot tea once you're seated. Yeaaah.
4 ||| So I go to this place whenever I reminisce about my hometown in the south.  They have descent comfort food for really cheap price.  \n\n*Food = descent comfort food (Fried okra mmm yum)\n*Price = REALLY cheap\n*Service = very nice, welcoming\n*Atmosphere = interesting...they have really cute shop attached to the restaurant.
3 ||| Ive been coming here for years. Its right in the Chinatown district. The food quality is very high & very good. You consistently get the same quality every time you come here. If you decide to eat in, the restaurant is cozy with ample table room and is a very quiet setting. Service, however is hit or miss.
4 ||| Great shop. Easy to work with especially when it came to rentals. I booked online and picked up signed some papers and I was on my way to an adventure of a lifetime. Nice and clean and a lot of soft goods on the floor, not very common at the HD shops in my home area. Great shop nice staff check em out!
2 ||| ---For Mountain Bike Service---\nBrought in my mid-90s Giant -- was feeling and hearing bearing noise when I cranked, so in my first investigation of service at REI, I described the problem to (signature scribbled) J Kaly. He told me the service person would take a look (first problem -- always talk directly to service people, if possible). It was returned with overhauled bottom bracket and the same feeling & bearing noises.\n\nMy best experiences to date have been at ASU's bike CO-OP and Dominic's.\nMy worst experiences have been both Tempe Bicycle at Rural & University (since 2013 began) and now REI.
4 ||| good place for a quick Guinness, or grab a patio seat\n\nfood is good, their Rachael is worth ordering (to-go especially)\n\nA good neighborhood joint!
3 ||| While visiting Phoenix, a fellow foodie said I MUST go to the Old Spaghetti Factory. \n\nI like the atmosphere. We sat in the bar area. It was kind of divey feeling with an antique flair. \n\nI wasn't impressed with the menu offerings. It seems scant for a place that came so highly recommended. I got the chicken parmigana. It was mediocre. Probably should have gotten the spaghetti my dinner mate was so smitten with. I did like that our meals came with a yummy cup of gellato. Delicious! \n\nIt was pretty good, but not great. I'd be willing to try it again before casting it aside.
3 ||| came here expecting some good shopping. i was pretty disappointed to find that there were only a handful of good outlet stores to check out. its a nice mall. really crowded on the weekends. doubt i will be frequenting this place.
0 ||| Disappointing location. The one on Cooper and Baseline is much better. The fries were mealy and salt deprived. The Royal Burger fell apart and the meat didn't have much flavor and was excessively salty.
3 ||| Whatever you do, don't talk smack about Chicago or the beloved Cubs at this Mesa sports bar, which is a haven for Cubby fans.\n\nHere's a bit of history for you -- its original owners were none other than legendary sports announcer Harry Caray and former Major League pitcher/current Cubs announcer Steve Stone.\n\nSports memorabilia decorates the walls. There's games a plenty to watch and a jukebox. Sluggo's is a big destination for people wanting to watch the game or just hang out before or after a spring training game. They offer the usual bar food and the drinks are pretty cheap.
0 ||| Sitting out by the pool today and it sucked. I had to ask for a server, and then the one we got couldn't answer a single question about the menu. The food was horrible and took 45 minutes. Not pleased at all.
4 ||| Wow! I'm impressed! As a manager of 2 restaurants , restaurant depot is my typical stop twice a week! And this place blew my mind! Produce prices and office supplies are insanely cheap here! Any business owner either opening a business or running one have to check this place out! Is their print and copy center does everything from menus to tshirts and even hats! On too of it all the silverware is extremely high quality and at an amazing price! Plus the there's always staff around to guide and and assist you with anything! They even help you load your car! 5 stars all day long!
4 ||| Reasons:\n\n1. LOCATION and setting: Highland Park is simply lovely - makes you feel as if you are in a small English town, where time has stood still. The art and small tables inside and outside are charming.\n2. Socially Responsible:Fair trade and international array of coffee.\n3. Fresh Meat:  Local pasture raised meat/ local produce in their tasty panini's.\n4. Nice crowd and staff.
0 ||| I wanted to give everyone an update from the last review I wrote about the Phoenix Airport Marriott experience. So, the General Manager, Jeff Bhatti, replied to the letter that me and my colleagues sent to them about their associate interaction and they basically told us that they received the letter, apologized for any inconvenience.\n\nHe also wrote in the letter:\n\n\"It is our objective to provide each and ever guest a comfortable stay with utmost respect and privacy. Your comments play a critical role in our success and progress. I appreciate the time you took to bring it to my attention. Based on you comments, I have shared my concerns with the staff and emphasized review of our training and procedures. We shall implement and improve any steps needed to ensure that our guests have a positive experience at the hotel. We are grateful for having had many opportunities over several of past years to successfully take care of hospitality needs of our guests while in Phoenix area. We look forward to continue with such relationship and will do our very best to prove our commitment to our objective.\"\n\nWhen we read that letter, we just looked at each other like that was just BS and were not satisfied by the half ass letter we received from the General Manager. First of all, there were spelling errors in the letter, and second of all, for them to say that they provide each and every guest a comfortable stay with the utmost respect and privacy. The two words he used, \"RESPECT\" and \"PRIVACY\" were two elements that the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel did not demonstrate to us during our time at their hotel. The guest relations worker did not show us RESPECT when she was talking back at us and asking if we planned to make any more noise after I expressed my concern about her sending strange men up to our room w/out any warning or notice to bring down the noise level (which there weren't any, we were just talking in our room. \n\nThere were no music on, no tv on, no blow dryer on, we were just talking our normal tones but I don't know if the walls are just SUPER thin or what but regardless, we should have received a phone call from them in the first place.). For her to say \"So you plan to make more noise next time?\" I wanted to be like \"No B****, I'm not! Stop being so fresh with me because I wasn't even trying to say that!! I was just bringing up my concern that there were two large men standing outside telling us it is our second warning and to OPEN the door when we haven't even received the FIRST warning in the first place!! Now, THAT is wrong and that is a violation of our PRIVACY!! Additionally, my friend told me that when we got into the hotel room, she noticed that those two men .. the SAME men that asked us to open the door, were checking us out at the hotel lobby. They were looking at us up and down which creeped out my friend. Since, we have 3 young ladies staying in the room, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE OPEN THE DOOR to TWO STRANGERS who were checking us out and Open the door for them?! We aren't even sure if they are hotel security. But regardless, the hotel did not make us feel SAFE or COMFORTABLE at all and again, me and my colleagues are extremely disappointed in how the management has handled our concerns.\n\nBasically, the letter that was sent to us was BS BS BS! Our company will never stay at their hotel again and I will make sure to spread the word to all our friends and family because when I do inform them about our horrible experience, they are absolutely appalled that the hotel made no efforts in making up the experience for us in any way. The \"thank you for bringing this up to our attention\" is BS to us and we will make sure that everyone who is looking for a hotel in Phoenix will never come to this establishment again. \n\nThank you for letter but we would rather give our business to another hotel that actually cares about their reputation and their guests!
0 ||| This place is wretched, and the service always sucks! We were one of only 3 tables in the place at 3:30pm and still had trouble getting served. The manager, or what looked like the manager (a person carrying keys, doing voids, and walking behind the bar) not once made eye contact with us. The server had to ask \"just so I get this straight...you ordered the salad with ranch\" We ordered the Ahi app, chips and guacamole, and the full-rack of ribs. The food was tasty, but once again the service sucks. Our server tried to give our tab to the ladies behind us, then complained out loud that the other server screwed things up, all the while we were waiting for the tab. He then had to explain that I really would not be getting charged twice, it would only be on my credit card for a few days. No one ever said thanks for coming in, and we were left to walk out...never to return.
0 ||| The last time I was in Phoenix I had a business dinner here and ordered their wings and then some special meal (included salad, chicken and something else).  The place was empty and the waitress was actually bothered we had chosen to eat dinner in her section.  To make a long story short - I got sick that night with some type of food poisoning and spent the next 12 hours trying to sleep between throwing up and running a fever.  Will definitely never go back.
3 ||| I think that rating an Olive Garden restaurant is like rating a McDonalds... kind of pointless and at best a 2-star experience along with all fast-food. But I'm kind of blown away that it would have a 4 out of 5 star Yelp rating alongside the likes of Pizzaria Bianco, Postino's, & Cibo.
2 ||| I'm a bit of a hotel snob- Ive stayed over 90 days in Starwood properties over the past year. So when i go to a property in the luxury collection I have high expectations. I expect St Regis / ritz kind of luxury and service. This property didn't deliver and neither did the staff.  It was ordinary, which, in the luxury collection, just doesn't cut it. \nI should have stayed it the aloft which is just down the street. I'm confident that they would have exceeded my more modest expectations.
1 ||| there were 4 in our party.  On entering, no eye contact from the seater, no hello, just \"how many?\"  She breezed us to our table,  didn't stop her stroll, threw 4 menus on the table with 3 seats and said \"Have a nice meal.\"  We didn't stay.
0 ||| First off, any Mexican place worthy of mention has good beans.  The beans at N. are so dry and flavorless it's like eating chalk.  Secondly, cheddar cheese melted atop every dish and that is NOT Mexican!!!  3rd- I ordered chile verde.  WHAT???  It was a slab of dry pork covered in Green Sauce!!!! DISGUSTING.
4 ||| Great Thai food - ambiance is great, good service, great food!
3 ||| The place is nice. Has wide aisles which is nice for such a place with all the hoity toities that just have to stand around looking like they're reading labels (which of course they are). The parking lot kinda sucks...there doesn't seem to be a designated lot. My cashier was super friendly. Suggested a green juice that was cheaper than most. She was a Chatty Cathy and I'm sure the long line behind me didn't enjoy that, but eh, you don't get that sort of conversation from strangers much these days.
0 ||| I've never been to Pittsburgh before and I planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so I booked this hotel the day before I drove up. I saw the reviews & ignored them because I figured I'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bed.\n\nI checked in around 2am, the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides \"initial here and sign here and your room is over there\". The room smelt like hot dogs, the AC wasn't working at all so I was dripping in sweat all night, none of the lamps worked at all, there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding, there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet, I went down for the continental breakfast at 9:30am (it ends at 10am) and they already stopped serving, the shower was ice cold. I then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole I spent the night in last night (coast is clear). I checked out and went back to Baltimore, which seems like heaven on earth compared to Shittsburgh.
0 ||| Well you've really out done yourself this time Great Clips on 44th & Thomas. Thanks for the usual shitty hair cut. This time the \"professional stylist\" cut my hair with the wrong size clippers, but I guess I should expect that from one of the worst run franchises in America. Thanks assholes!
3 ||| This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Central Phoenix, but I give it three stars because of the complete lack of atmosphere, the prices being a bit more than what I would expect, and the service being so-so. Still, great bagels and home fries, good traditional breakfast dishes, and an astounding tongue sandwich (which is, admittedly, a lunch item).
3 ||| Didn't have much here, just wanted to grab a snack or something. I did end up with 1/2 almond chicken salad sandwich and soup. The sandwich could have used some more seasonings in the chicken salad, but otherwise was prety good in a normal, kind of good way. Soup was boiling hot is what i recall, it was veggie with basil. Too much tomatoes and needed more veggies, although basil was spotted and that helped. It was almost 9 bucks for that snack. Oh, i got a free chocolate chip cookie with that deal and that was a fairly tasty ending with good chip chunkage. Haven't eaten in the middle of a mall food court in awhile, very zoolike quality to that experience.
4 ||| Very patient and nice. Some of their jewelry is affordable for the common person. I bought my girlfriend a necklace, a ring, and earrings there. Each time, I had great customer service.
0 ||| This company doesn't deserve even zero star . I called from my hotel in Mesa and answered all questions . I am told taxi will be there about 20 minutes . I was in lobby more than 35 minutes and nothing !! When I called and asked , they said there is no information about me in the system and if I want taxi I should give them the information and waiting another 20 minutes . Unbelievable. ....It's shame. ..Janat
4 ||| I LOVE T. Reid & Company! The atmosphere is so nice! My hairstylist Noel Lance is the absolute best! He's knowledgeable & only gives the best advice for your hair. Not to mention he is a fun guy & chats away with you, making time fly by! Go check him out if you want a fun, hip, knowledgeable stylist!
1 ||| Something about this particular Applebee's is off-putting. The food wasn't as good as others, the interior wasn't as inviting and like others, the waiters would all meet up at the bar and talk to each other until someone walked in to be seated.\n\nWould be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it.
4 ||| Sick, need the best chicken noodle soup that Mom didn't make?  Come to Jason's! Plentiful moist chicken, plump egg noodles and perfect broth are available everyday for $4 something a bowl. Sick or not I'll drive to pick up a bowl to-go!\n\nMy favorite sandwich is the pastrami & turkey on an onion roll, called  \"Bird to the wise\". Lots of pastrami and just a touch of turkey make you feel better about this indulgence.  \n\nLarge fresh salad bar, frozen yogurt and bottomless soda machine are just the bonuses. \nHappy eating!
3 ||| You when you hear about a place for years and you finally get the chance to try it out but it's bound to not live up to your expectations? That was my experience of Tessaro's. Had I never heard of it before, it may have gotten an extra star. But, this restaurant was on the Pittsburgh's top 25 a few years back. This is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh. If that were the case, I'd stick to making my own. \nHubs and I stopped at T's on a recent Friday night after conducting some business in the area. Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it. We were in a bit of a hurry so I didn't mention it to my server, though I'm not sure it would have made a difference seeing hubs medium burger was also dry. Overall, Tessaro's fell flat and left me hung out to dry.
0 ||| Every time I go....HORRIBLE! Stale taco shells, hard uncooked beans..need I go on?\n\nStay clear of this Taco bell.
4 ||| This place is AWESOME! Great beer and wine selection and the deli has specials.      ( vegetarian and non vegetarian )  to make you drool! YUM! Also with the street under construction, I had my lunch delivered to me by a cute boy on a bike.!! A great  place with an eclectic and friendly staff!
4 ||| Basil Thai is good for exactly what it is--convenient, cheap, dependable Thai food on campus, served hot and promptly.  I haven't shopped the whole menu, but I like what I regularly get, and that's fine with me.
4 ||| This is the coolest, funnest, down as fuckest bar I have ever been to in my life. Super fun crowd just down to have a good time. No attitudes or pretention like at the Palo Verde . Just a really fun cool diverse crowd dancing to some of the best DJs I have ever been so blessed to hear. Again, the best bar I have EVER been to.
1 ||| Too expensive. Go to the clears in the wells fargo buiding uptown
4 ||| This restaurant is my favorite restaurant in Uptown. I first visited this restaurant before I moved to Charlotte. I was walking Uptown one day and decided to give them a try. Once I saw that they served soul food, that was it for me. For one reason it is very hard to find restaurants nowadays that are homey and laid back. It feels like home when you walk in the door. You've gotta be crazy to not like the place. They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork , that was definitely a winner for me), and lamb chops. My favorite sides are their mac & cheese, collard greens and sweet potatoes. At first taste, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I felt like I was in my Mother's kitchen again. The food is great, the staff is great and I would recommend it to anyone. Out of all the times I've gone, there was only once that I was a little displeased with what I had ordered.
4 ||| Cheap lunch specials... They give alot for just $5.95 includes corn egg drop soup with your meal!\nI had the mangolian beef w/ white rice... beef was tender and tasty...  Definitely can be shared with 2 people.
0 ||| Ok, so I tried the one in Gilbert and gave it a terrible review because of the waitress and price of food. So a friend said to try the one in Scottsdale because the food is really good and there is a younger waitress that is spot on with the service.\nThis place is down right scummy! Don't eat here is you value your life. The wiatress no longer works there and good for her. She was smart enough to get out of this dump. This owner Chad is a jerk. So arrogant and sits around on his stupid phone while others are working. I really don't blame the wait staff. The apple bakes are suppose to be the best around. Sure if you like your food to put you in a diabetic coma. There was so much sugar, I am surprise it didn't give be diabetes right then. I had to ask for an egg over easy just to try to eat something good. After waiting for 30 minutes for one egg, wow. $2.25 for 1 egg. It's an egg with nothing in it or on it. My first review of this place was correct. NOOOOOOO Way, Never again!!!!!
4 ||| LOVE the Sizzling enchiladas!!! This hard to find location is so good, best Tex-Mex style I have found in the area. My family loves this place!
0 ||| I *used* to think Donatelli's was a great place--they're incredibly cheap, the premade foods like crab raviolis are delicious, and they have awesome chocolate covered pretzels and biscotti.\nThen I saw one of the deli members drop meat on the floor, pick it up, and stick it right back in the case! Also, a whole tray of meatballs and sauce from the hot bar was spilled all over the floor. They just scooped it right back in and I only hope it wasn't served! The place smells awful and the workers are grumpy. There's a lady there who's always screaming and cursing and some fat guy that's just as bad. The LAST experience I had with Donatelli's was when I bought a tub of \"freshly packed\" soynuts. I got home, cracked a brew, and reached into my beer snack to find a WORM!!! If you value your health as I do, do not eat anything from Donatelli's that  was packed there.
4 ||| This is a place you have to go to if you're having a late night in downtown.  Everything is always delicious.
3 ||| Great rates, friendly staff, clean room, spacious bathroom!  A bit noisy when folks arrived late at night and from the train horn in the morning and the bed is a bit too soft for my tastes.  I'd stay again if needed.
0 ||| I can't actually rate the food because we left before it got that far. \n\nDrinks and service were horriable - not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there. Ohh and they  seem to have worked very hard in the design to  fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort. There are tables jammed into every possible space.
4 ||| What a cool store. It's so trendy and chic that it's almost intimidating! The sales people are chatty and polite, allowing customers to simply 'hang out' on the displayed furniture.
4 ||| TimeBomb is without a doubt the best spot in Pittsburgh to get all the exclusive Raw street merchandise. This is my favorite store in the city not only because of it's selection of merchandise, but for it's uniqueness. \n\nThe owner Brick who started the store in '95 I believe is a great guy who always takes care of his loyal customers. I've received free apparel, stickers, DVDs, mixtapes, you name it from Brick. He's a man who knows how to keep his customers coming back! \n\nAll in all TimeBomb is the place to shop in Pittsburgh if you're looking to \"Get Your Life Right\"
1 ||| I would not go back for the Sliders or Beef Items.   I ordered the following(TO GO) on 2 Saturday afternoons 1 week apart:\n\nChili - There was sugar in the Recipe.  I did not like.\nSliders - Something sweet in the Meat, Perhaps sugar.   Nothing like White Castle.  If you are seeking the White Castle experience you will be dissappointed.  \nColeslaw - Raw Onion is in abundance and takes away from the very fresh Cabbage.  If they get a handle on the Onion they have a winner.\n\nWings -  Basic\n\nHot Dog - Basic - however the Poppyseed Roll was very fresh and the French Fries(although standard frozen potatoes) were delicious and cooked perfectly, both times.\n\nBiggest dissapoinment:   The Philly Cheese Steak.  There is something that is giving the meat items a bad taste/odor.   I really doubt the meat is old due to the Restaurant is quite busy.  Perhaps it is how they store the items as a strange undeterminable odor is getting into the Bread or Meat.  I ordered twice on busy Saturday afternoons.  Meat/Bread Items had the same Odor.   It is not a dirty odor. \n\nNevertheless, I would only return for the $4.85 Hot Dog which comes with French Fries.
0 ||| So I just rushed home from Blue because I couldn't wait to get on here and give them this review.  Ok, I'm lying.  I made one stop on the way home - Barnes and Noble -  to buy a dictionary so I could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me.  If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.'\n\nSo I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table.  The service was atrocious and incredibly slow.  At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there.  Initially I thought this was part of the \"Blue experience,\" but its not.  The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out.  \nSo the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right?  Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc.  So NOBODY went home with their own food.  I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps.  \n\nSo, food, how was the the food?  Not quite horrible, but not quite good either.  Edible is a better word for it.  I got the \"Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba.\"  sounds fancy, eh?  Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle.  It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do.  I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances.  Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered.\n\nSo let's circle back for a second, and return to service.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say.  Maybe she was just over capacity?  I don't know.  But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think).  This is how that conversation went:\nManager: \"hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up.  But how was everything?\"\nMe: \"Well, it was ok.  some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others.\"\nManager: (blank stare)\nMe:  (awkward moment)\nManager; \"well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh....\" (blank stare).\nMe: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave).\nManager: (blank stare and walks away).\n\nneedless to say, I will never come back here again.  If it were free, I would probably still pass.  If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.
4 ||| A tiny, old gas station turned sandwich shop that sits right next to Pioneer Memorial Park & Cemetery is a hot-spot for near-by state gov workers and Capitol lurkers. After doing a quick Google search of Old Station, I came across a short piece from the New Times about the history of this needle-in-a-haystack.  The building sat on Jefferson Street since 1926, beginning its life as a Mobile gas station and includes the best display of historic Arizona license plates in the state.  While you wait for your sandwich, look at the front wall and check out the array of AZ license plates dating back to 1912!  Pretty cool.  \n\nOh, and the subs are pretty darn good too. There are approximately 30 sub variations, along with daily soup specials, fruit bowls, chips and the much beloved Rice Krispy Treats!  There is a nice outdoor patio in the back and a sufficient number of tables inside, which is surprising based on the small square footage of the place. Lunch time is busy, but the staff keep things moving and always with a smile.  They also serve breakfast -- burritos and subs. Check it out sometime; you'll get some good eats and a great sense of history in a town where history is sometimes lacking.
0 ||| The place is pretty nice so that's not my beef. The service sucks sucks sucks. Over priced for the wrong service and they will not refund anything. Go elsewhere.
1 ||| Great homemade noodles. Below average thai green curry. Average tofu. No air conditioning even on 80+ degree humid day.
3 ||| I think this is a great option for a fast meal that doesn't feel like fast food.  The staff have always been very wonderful when we visit - we were there for Valentines Day (we keep it pretty lowkey) and they have white tablecloths and chocolate kisses on the tables.  Their Tuscan seasoned Chicken is delicious and we always try new sides which have all been good - their squash casserole stuff was surprisingly tasty!  My boyfriend is always a sucker for their creamed spinach.  I love getting extra cornbread to warm up for breakfast the next day.\nWe also ordered their heat-at-home Easter meal while we watched the Game of Thrones premiere and I thought we got a great value for the package price.  The ham was delicious and all of the sides (sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, and we added macaroni and cheese) were delicious, plus we got 2 apple pies! It was a tasty feast with leftovers for everyone.\nAlso, when you dine during the week, you get a coupon for the upcoming Saturday for a Buy One Get One meal. I always forget to back on Saturday but I swear next time I will!
2 ||| cons      OVER PRICED!!!!!\npros       EMPLOYEES KNOW THIER STUFF\npros       6 MONTH LAY-A-WAY (for the over priced merchandise)\n\nFor me.... just because the employess are \"knowledgeable\" doesn't mean I have to pay an extra 75-100 bucks. \n\nThis is one of the only places in Charlotte that I would feel comfy (and HAVE purchased a gun or 2 from here) coming to. \n\nI would come here to gain knowledge of a certain gun, then go somewhere else to purchase. Unless I use my sisters Military Discount.. (Which would still leave me paying too much)\n\nSIDE NOTE..... Guns don't kill ppl..... ppl w/ guns kill ppl. I have yet to find the scientifc study to a room filled with guns.. Which Gun would fire off (randomly w/o someone pulling a trigger).   Guess I'll keep checking FOX news... \n\nCheers
2 ||| Adding a star to my previous rating.  I won't say anything more about brunch because I haven't been back for it, but dinner here is MUCH better.  I had steak, it was tender and delicious.  Dinner here is good enough that I would bring out of town guests here to impress them. \nBut I can't forget that lukewarm brunch, so we're still at 3 stars average.
4 ||| I have never been a huge fan of French food, but my friend lived in France for 12 years and knew just what to order.  Everything we ate was right on and fantastic including the wine.  Spinach salad with poached egg, plate of cheese comes with bread, apples, nuts, jam and olives and the duck sandwich was just enough mixture with duck to not be to overly rich. My friend said the decor looked just like if you were in Paris.  We sat at the high-top next to the bar, light breeze coming in and great service from the bartender.  Sorry, cant remember his name, but he has been there a long time and is always friendly and not to mention eye-candy.  Cant wait to go back.
4 ||| I'm pretty sure fast food doesn't get better than this.  \n\nAnd when every thing on the menu starts with 'famous', at ANY OTHER restaurant, you should question it.  But not here.  Their famous sweet tea rocks;  their famous sweet potato pie rocks; their famous chicken and biscuits rocks.  \n\nI almost brought some to come with me on the plane.
1 ||| So apparently everything has changed at our favorite neighborhood Mexican place.  The last 2 times we were the food was terrible!  3 Margarita's officially broke my heart and I am unwilling to get hurt again!
2 ||| I was here for Mother's Day brunch last year.\n\nThey only get 3 stars bc the restaurant is so beautiful inside, and the brunch was ridiculously expensive.  The food was ok, there was a very long line for omelets--longer than it should have been but they are made to order so I understand that.  Things felt a little disorganized and as the restaurant was packed it was completely chaotic and not the relaxing brunch w/ our mother that we had hoped for.\n\nThe only time we were blown away was when my sister and i saw the amount our bill came to.  I was def wishing I had more siblings with whom to split this check.\n\nThe service just sucked.  Though we had reservations we had to wait and were seated out in a little porch area--which ended up being kind of cool because it was pouring rain and we were under sky lights so it was a little cozy.  However we were freaking PACKED in there to the point where I was unable to get out of my table bc the chairs from the table behind us were blocking us in.\n\nI would probably NOT come to the restaurant if I were given the option of chosing where we dined.  I MIGHT go to this restaurant again but only if Grandma said its where she wanted to go for her birthday.  Ok--I might try the brunch again.  I do heart omelets.  But this brunch is not something I am going to go out of my way for.\n\nThis place is gorgeous inside but the over priced crappy food and the crap service do not make it worth while.\n\n3 stars for beautiful architecture and great potential.\n\nI want to like this place...but it just falls short.
2 ||| I stayed here at an incredibly cheap rate via hotwire. I was quite pleased with the value, although the room I stayed in lacked the character found in the grand hotel lobby below. Nevertheless, the room was quiet, clean, and very comfortable, except that the window let in almost no light thanks to a building adjacent to the hotel. I really mean no light, as in at noon it was dark. I presume that other, higher floors have nicer rooms.
4 ||| Since I'd been hearing many good comments about this place we decided to give it a try. Let me tell you, we don't regret it at all!!  Place is clean (even bathrooms), servers and cooks are very helpful and friendly.  We had the Flautas Ahogadas (rolled tacos drown in tomato sauce), Twin Burritos(red and green shredded beef) and a Chilindrina. All of the food was so good!!  We also had Mango and Horchata Aguas Frescas and they were the bomb!! \nCan't wait to come back for some dessert since we end up with no space for it after our dinner.\nRestaurant didn't get 5 stars because is a bit over crowded, sitting area by kitchen was very hot and is not as big as it needs for all the clients they get. I think next time we'll take order to go. And I say next time because we're definitely coming back!! Overall was a good experience. I would recommend you try this place at least once. But I can assure you'll be back!!!
1 ||| I've heard a lot of mix reviews about this place through the years. So I finally decided to try it out for myself a few weeks ago and been wanting to come write a review. I LOVE Chinese food so when I went in to order carry out I decided to pick some of my regular dishes to try. \n\nThe customer service wasn't very great to begin with. The lady wasn't very friendly and helpful in suggesting any special dish. Here are my reviews on the dishes that I did buy. \n\nPork Fried Rice - It was blah! There was no flavor to the rice but oil. \n\nGeneral Tso Chicken - It was blah too!! Barely any flavors\n\nHouse Special Lo Mein - This one taste a lot better than the other two dishes, but was just okay for me too. \n\nThe only dish I did like was their Beef, Shrimp and Scallop stir fry dish, but none of the dishes really screamed that I will be visiting again next time! \n\nMy husband did mention that they have Japanese and sushi on their menu also so I would still like to go back to try this part of their menu out, but will not be going back there for Chinese food.
1 ||| Before I get to the negative feedback I will give the positive.\n+ the customer service is wonderful\n+ the lobby is very nice \n+ the views are great from the rooms \nThe negatives\n- the walls are paper thin. We heard a newborn and toddler crying for 2 hrs starting at 6am and the mom lecturing them. We heard everything clearly. On the other side of our wall we heard the problems and advice in a break up. Again all clearly. \n- the sheets and blankets feel like they are made from the same paper as the walls. \n- the bed was very uncomfortable \n- even on the 21st floor we could hear the kids at the pool screaming as we tried to nap from lack of sleep in the morning. \n- the parking is 12.00 with no ins & outs. That was very inconvenient \n\nWith our daughter considering college in town we will never consider staying here again
0 ||| *BEWARE* I have had my dogs groomed at Smoochie Poochie multiple times, not because the haircuts are the best, but because I was going the economical route. Never again will I risk my pets' health to save a buck!\n\nThe last two grooming sessions have left my dog injured.  The first injury occurred on a hind leg, where the fur was cut so closely and the razor burn was so intense that he now has a large bald patch.  \n\nThe most recent injury occurred last week, when my dog was sent home with a large wound on his neck.  It appeared as though some sort of coagulant was applied to stop bleeding and a bandana was placed around his neck.  I was not informed of the injury when I picked him up and the establishment denied any wrongdoing when questioned about it later.\n\nAfter an urgent trip to the vet, my poor dog is left with a two inch gash on his neck, round-the-clock pain medicine, and a course of antibiotics.  The vet stated that this was absolutely the result of grooming trauma and urged me to find a new groomer.\n\nI realize that accidents happen and that dogs are wiggly, but this is unacceptable.  I am appalled that Smoochie Poochie didn't alert me to the injury, denies any wrongdoing, and refuses to apologize.  \n\nSave your dog from harm and injury and save yourself from the heartache you'll feel when they maim your dog, too.
4 ||| Look out for their specials! Each day, they have.drinks.and.food. Today is Saturday, they have 8Oz steak & veggies.& soup for.$8.25 and long island iced tea for $3.50 and ipr can for $2! Shot of the day.. White trash apple. no comment\n\nHidden place indeed! The bar is located on Broadway in Tempe. I think I would miss this place if it weren't for the lights.Their specials are very tempting. Too bad we weren't feeling the crowd much and only grabbed A drink. There are table seats, bar seats and bench seats. The bar feels like a dive bar but actually feeds you food. Too bad we didn't get to try it.\n\nLooking for a place to watch a game? I would recommend here since there are big screen T.Vs all over the place. There's darts, pool and I think a scratchers machine. I would much rather spend the money on their cheap drinks than scratchers! HEHE \n\nI would recommend you all to look at their webpage to see what's on their special. \nhttp://prankstersgarandbrill.com/specials.html#liquid-specials \n\nOh...Did I mention they have daily shots?! They are very creative naming their shots of the day. :P
4 ||| Something is definitely right about this place. I had the white fish with capers in a great sauce, potatoes and spinach. Very satisfying. Some people had the turkey which is always delicious. The servers and manager were so anxious to please. $5 wine all the time is great! Mimis always has coupons emailed to us for extra savings. Mimis tries harder!
3 ||| Every once in a while I'll meet my Henderson friends here for a drink or three.  We enjoy meeting here because it's a fun place to meetup.  We'll head to one of the bars and have a Beer and for the gamblers in the group, they enjoy the huge selection of Video Poker machines offered.\n\nSince I don't gamble, I stick around the bar area and people watch....good times.\n\nThe casino is always kept clean and the employees are mostly friendly.  The only thing I don't like is parking....I prefer the parking garage in the back of the property rather than the surface lot, which seems to be a magnet for road ragers.\n\nReturn Factor - 40%.....only because I live on the other side of town.
1 ||| Had a not so good experience at Nello's. I first must admit I'm ancient. First had Nello's Pizza back in the 80's while living in Tempe. I think that might be when they originated. Nello's and a pizzeria called Sunny's back in the 80's had the most awesome pizza. As a college student it was great to get away from Pizza Hut & Domino's Pizza and have gourmet pizza with a couple of friends.  \n\nSo upon my return to the Valley I had hopes that I could relive that awesome Pizzeria experience at Nello's that I last experienced 18 years ago when I was here for a wedding of a friend and went out for Pizza during that visit.\n\nI'm pretty sure the location has changed.  And sadly so has the pizza.  I ordered a 10\" Pan crust with Sausage, smoked bacon, feta and Onions (non-red kind).  The crust was okay, tender and yeasty I would say.  The feta cheese could not be tasted it was so sparse on the pie. I actually only saw one crumb of feta!  The smoked bacon was minced very fine (finer than war rations bacon), it was also twice the price of the other toppings and twice as limited in appearing on my pie! The Sausage made a decent appearance on the pie. It's flavor was over powering in it's nickle size lumps.  Sorta tasted like an old man germy wool muffler, probably the ones recipe they have fucked with. The onions could be tasted in a few bites. The regular cheers topping was in good standing and had a pleasant stringy pull while hot.   \n\nA 10\" Pizza ($13.50), a not so chilled 4 Peaks Heffie pint of beer ($3.50) and a $2 tip and the city's cut in tax made for a $20 disappointing meal for one!  I felt completely ripped off by the lack of toppings I paid for.  I should have complained but what good would have done? So I just ate and left.\n\nDoubt if I'll suggest the place or even return again unless I'm not buying!  How they maintain such esteemed ratings is a mystery to me.
4 ||| As we often go to Vegas, we wanted to try a sushi place that out of the strip that the locals go. We yelped it and found Tokyo. We had great time and the price is not over priced like all the places on the strip. The sushi chef, it's a she, pretty good and very friendly. They gave us two complimentary, which are pretty yummy. The fishes are fresh and they have good selection of foods not just straight sushi. Definitely will come back if we're in Sin City!
3 ||| They raised their prices again bah hah.  And when they send coupons out now they are only for 6\" inch sandwich and still give less meat then port of subs.
2 ||| So after hearing about all the raves and reviews about Primanti Bros, I had to try it for myself. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit disappointed. I think it is more of a novelty thing than anything. I would say yes, you should try it if you happen to come to Pittsburgh, but try not to expect a lot because that might have killed the sandwich for me.\n\nThe sandwich is packed with great meat, but the fries were pretty soggy and coleslaw that day was a bit too much pepper for my liking. I thought the fries might have been soggy because of the coleslaw so I ordered another order of fries (since I'm generally a fries fiend), but even those were soft and not up to par. I was pretty disappointed at that. However, the meat was pretty delicious. I got corned beef and it was delicious slices and it was cooked well.\n\nI would say overall verdict: try the place but try with an open mind.
0 ||| 1 Star for Komol? Absolutely. Komol's food is usually really good, so much so that it's been on my weekly lunch rotation for almost 2 years. But no matter how good their food is, if you can't get service nothing else matters. Less than an hour ago as I write this and for the 2nd time recently I've walked out without getting my food. If the parking lot is packed service always seems to suffer. Thursdays in particular seem to be the worst. \n\nWhile LOS across the parking lot is a lot more expensive and overrated in my opinion, at least I can get something to eat there. When the Komol staff knows you by name, and even knows your favorite order and they still screw it up...yeah, that's certainly 1 Star worthy.
3 ||| Harkins is still a great place to catch amovie with the reclining chairs and digital sound and screen.  Their prices have gone up at the concession stand but you can buy discounted movie tickets at Costco and still enjoy soda refills but those are now $1.50 ( instead of $1.00 ) and the souvernior cup is $5.00 ( instead of $4.50 ) that is a $1 increase.  Harkins is better than AMC although AMC has better prices especially in the afternoons but Harkins rules when it comes to comfort.
1 ||| The place has gone downhill. Smaller everything and higher prices. Service was prompt and friendly. \nWe came in on Saturday morning. Years ago you would have to wait to be seated, today we walked right in. Go next door to Babystacks.
0 ||| Terriable. They broker the shipping of books on line. I ordered 4 books, they sent one directly and it was written in, yellow, smelly and disgusting. They refunded my dollar but not the four dollar shipping. I threw that book away. The other three books came from different shippers/resourses and all claimed to ship on the same date, I received one and then another 4 days later and the last I never received, when I contacted HPB they asked me to contact the shipper. DON'T BUY BOOKS HERE!!  There are much better sites to do this from.
1 ||| I Still a great experience but had to lower my rating. I just received my bill for over $14,000!!!!!  Wow!! I am in the wrong business! Some pain medication, C.T. scan and some blood work for $14,000!!! (no ambulance ride either)  Good thing my insurance is taking care of most of the cost. Admittedly, I know very little about the cost of these services but that sure seems a bit high for only being there for 4 hours and having procedures that are done on a daily basis.
4 ||| It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy.
4 ||| Breakfast experience -- 4/5\nSo, for those that don't know, this is probably one of the best breakfast specials in town.  For $1.99 you get two eggs however you want, two slices of toast (or an English muffin), two slices of bacon (or sausage) and home fries.\n\nAnd it is ALL delicious.  I've ordered a couple of different combinations and I have some custom requests (eggs fried over hard, bacon extra crispy, home fries extra crispy) and it always comes out correct.\n\nSo, why 4 out of 5?  Sometimes the service can be godawful slow in the mornings... and I don't mean the chef.  When you're trying to get in and get out, that can prove to be a challenge.\n\nLunch experience -- 5/5\n5 for $5.95 deal offers a 1/3 lb burger+fries, chicken Caesar salad, a mini pizza and two other things that I can't remember.  I got the burger and honestly, from the other reviews, I didn't really expect too much.\n\nIt's really, really tasty.  Beats going to any fast food joint, and it's a good price point.  Also, great service during lunch.  I guess people working in a bar at 8am simply don't want to be there... go figure.  -:P\n\nI've also tried their spinach & artichoke dip here -- absolutely fabulous, and I am SO picky about my spinach & artichoke dip.  My friend raves about the macaroni and cheese but I have yet to try that one out.  -:)
4 ||| We have been using A&P nurseries over the last 25 years and have had great service with lawn mower repairs and plant selection. I was particularly impressed with their service today. There were no less than 4 people that offered to help me with my plant selection. It is nice to go to a nursery that carries plants that grow in our harsh climate. I never trust the \"big box\" nurseries as many of their plants come from California and are not always adapted to this area. Always glad to give my business to a locally-owned nursery too.
4 ||| Clean, great atmosphere, great service and techs take their time for a good job! I had Mary and she was great. They currently offer 20% off all services... Made a great deal!
0 ||| Rolls. That is my primary reason for going to a place like this more than once. Texas Roadhouse has the best dinner rolls when they are served hot. Throw in the cinnamon butter and it's a little oral fiesta. I am NOT someone who likes going to Outback Steakhouse-type chains. I only set foot in Texas Roadhouse because I won a gift certificate. But considering the prices, the quality is more than decent. Their ribs are truly fall-off-the-bone. I had their country fried chicken which wasn't very greasy--points for that. They also serve really tasty catfish fillets that aren't dry and are flavorful. I also like how one of their many sides offerings includes sweet potatoes. And they are big potatoes. You can easily come away with leftovers which means, two meals for the price of one. \n\nIf you are not in the mood to be in a place where the wait staff highlights birthdays very loudly, then skip Roadhouse. When it's someone's b-day, they actually have the person sit on a saddle and get everyone to sort of \"yeehaw\" along. It's like a bad commercial. Anyway, I can see myself going into one if I'm in the neighborhood and want to splurge on food that isn't the healthiest.
4 ||| My mom's long-time manicurist, Mary, just bought this salon. The former owner didn't take care of the building or the supplies inside so it's been quite an uphill battle to get this business back on its feet. The spa pedicure is wonderful-- the nice warm water treated with moisturizers, the massage chairs, and the foot/calf rub you get will be so relaxing, you'll be snoring in no time. Mary is the sweetest lady in the enTIRE world and she does everything in her power to make sure you are happy with the service(s) you receive. She accomodated the french tips that I wanted-- a thicker white band than usual since my nails grow super fast. Many manicurists will look at you cock-eyed or flat out agree to do what you ask but do what *they* want anyway. Not Mary, she's a super star!\n\nThe shop is still \"up and coming\" as the owners are working on improving the aesthetics of the shop and the quality of materials left behind by former management, so give it the benefit of the doubt and feel good about supporting a business that's well on it's way to fabulous. \n\nIf you're a friendly, experienced, and reliable manicurist looking for a new salon, call and talk to Mary. Get in on this special salon before it's full.\n\nHighly recommended!
0 ||| It's hard to believe this is a Marriott property.  I've logged over 50 nights at this hotel so I think I'm decently qualified to offer a balanced review.  This last stay will be my last overall.  Although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.  This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason.  I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work.  I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.  The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  I then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.  Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.  During a single stay, I have never heard so many staff say, \"I apologize for that\".  Sorry isn't enough, I'll be trying the Hilton Garden Inn next time.  Good service speaks for itself and does not require apologies.
0 ||| I would only come back here to play their $100 slot promotion,(they give you $100 to play at their special slot machines) but other than that.. this place is trash! This was the old Hotel San Remo and I personally liked that better than Hooters! I only saw ONE cute girl that worked there who gave me a drink and said,\"Thanks baby!\" LOL!... Wouldn't they hire cuter girls?!?? Not impressed. Plus, it's far from the strip. (Didn't stay here, just gambled)
1 ||| They do NOT give sauce, double check your bag! Asked for a handful, got 1 per sandwich! Dorkwipes.
0 ||| Too oily , i felt like im eating pure fat , even the bread is covered with oil ! I suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option, grape leaves are very dry and tasteless. Oh and their fries are terrible
2 ||| The Portugese sausage fried rice omelette was delicious!\nI can't say enough good things about it so I won't say anything else at all and just let you yelpers try it for yourselves.  The lumpia was just so so.  Spam musubi is normal. Better than L&L but not by much.  When i was here I saw a homeless lady with her 3 kids walk in to use the bathroom and drink water that is provided out in the open for apparently anyone.  A little disturbing but it was 115 degrees outside and I don't want to see anybody die from the heat so I was like whatever.  If the owner or employees want to allow this that's there choice.
3 ||| BEWARE of the hidden amenity fee. At first look, the rooms seem so cheap, but then also add onto that price an addiitonal $16 for an amenity fee that they automatically charge you even if you don't want to use their internet. \n\nThat's the only reason why Sunset Station gets 4 stars. Other than that, the rooms are very clean, new looking, and nice. The casino tables have low minimums which is nice.\n\nAlso, the hotel is huge! It has a movie theater, starbucks, and tons of restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a quieter place to stay away from the strip
1 ||| This store has cleaned up a lot since the last time I was here.  I have been trying really hard to stay away from Walmarts, and going here today reminded me why.  They rearranged some of the store to make more sense.  The pet food is near the people food and it seems the toy area has increased in size.  Over all the store seems cleaner and brighter, which is nice.\n\nThe non existence customer service is still rampant though as it is with most Walmart locations.  I looked for something online, the site said it was in stock here.  It was not on the shelve, so I went to the site to store area and it was deserted. I wondered off to the electronics area since it was the only place with workers and computers.  I asked someone there to see if it was in stock but they refused to help me.  They pointed to some other worker who was walking away and told me to chase her down.  I followed her all the way to the break room area but just couldn't catch her in time.  \n\nThat's when I realized how silly that all seemed.  Chasing someone down for help.  I shouldn't have to chase anyone down when I have a real live person right in front of me whom I'm already talking to.  Just help me instead of passing the buck.  I guess I needed a reminder of why I've been avoiding this store.
4 ||| When a place is famous for something (ie having the best burgers in Pittsburgh) thats what you should order.  Theres a reason it has that distinction.   \n\nBut in an effort to keep my waistline from increasing, i decided NOT to get a burger at Tessaros.  Instead i got the chili and the side grilled veggie kabob.   To this day i can not tell you why the side of grilled vegetables cost me $5 but it did.   It wasn't bad, it just was not a lot and nothing special.\n\nAnd the chili... there was something weird about it that i couldn't put my finger on.  Until i realized what it was.... KETChUP!  There was a distinct ketchup taste to it.  Which was actually good!  I actually did enjoy the chili because it was very unique... and i also love ketchup. \n\nOverall it wasn't bad.. prices were decent, staff friendly and the table cloths made of jeans!  But definitely next time i will forget about my waistline and go ahead and get the darn burger!
4 ||| AMAZING! The staff was so friendly, welcoming and the food was superb! The sangria is a must try and their vegetarian dishes are amazing!
0 ||| What a cute place!!\nThat is about the only positive thing about Aunt Chilada's, unfortunately.  The food is not even mediocre IT SUCKS!!  Started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery!  And the service sucks too :(
4 ||| Small. Bad parking. The sort of service you'd expect in a country known for... well, being Jamaica. The food is great. Lunch buffet is the perfect blend of meat and spiced meat and BBQ meat. Pig and Chicken deluxe. I don't know about Vegan/Veggie options. Price isn't bad. Can get crowded. I like it very much. Recommend for lunchtime.
3 ||| Fun place to go and see some Packers take em down!
4 ||| I have been bringing both my vehicles here regular ever since they opened years ago...always fast, friendly and they do great work...would recommend to everyone.
0 ||| I used to shop at Officemax often, but no more.\n\nI got a card in the mail good for $10 off a purchase of $50 or more.\nI needed a new router and they had them on sale. I went in bought the router on sale for $48 and I bought some ink for my printer. They rang me up took the card and gave me the discount no problem. \n\nThen I got home and the router didn't work. I called the manufacture's tech support and after about 30 minutes they told me the router itself was bad and gave me a return code to take it back to OfficeMax.\n\nI returned the router, they were out of the one I purchased so I bought a different one that was the EXACT SAME Price.\n\nWhen I went to the register to pay for it the cashier told me the total came to $11 and some change. \nI asked how can that be? I bought a router, it didn't work, I returned it and got a different router that was the exact same price. \n\nThey told me I used a coupon the first time and unless I had another coupon I needed to pay the difference.\n\nI asked for the manager and he said the same thing so I walked out to my truck and grabbed the ink I purchased then returned it too, got my money back and drove across the street to a different store and bought the router there.\n\nThey obviously need to learn about customer service.
4 ||| The best best pizza I've had in the Vegas area so far its in Henderson I suggest to anyone to make a detour to this place this pizza is the bomb salads are the bomb service is the bomb go for it will not be disappointed
1 ||| Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally.  Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since i love BBQ.  No such luck.  Nothing seemed like real BBq  just over cooked and tasteless.  Very Chain resturant-y,  Cool memorabilia abut that's about it.  They only give a small cup of BBQ sauce for your meal.  I don't reccommend.
2 ||| As I grew up in the Metrocenter area I've been going to AJ's for years, since it was YC's. It's pretty good. It's inexpensive, they offer turkey, beef, pork, and chicken, lots of veggies, and sauces for a myriad of flavors, fast service, and plenty of food, even for the lunchtime deal of one bowl per customer (dinner is all you can eat). I've had other Mongolian BBQ around town and AJs is the best. Since it gets 3 stars, I suppose that means PHX isn't exactly the place to be if you want amazing Mongolian BBQ, but there it is.
0 ||| This place is a dump .... mold everywhere toilets.sinks.showers in cabinets would not deem reasonable for a prison let alone an apartment complex
4 ||| Hello Chuck, We just wanted to say \"thank you\" again for all you did to make our \"kids\" Mike and Stephanies wedding so lovely and enjoyable. The setting was just out of this world and the pampering was great. I would recommend the Morning Glory to anyone who would want an intimate outdoor wedding.\n\nThanks again.
0 ||| Second time i ordered Chicago style pizza thought i would give them a fair chance.\nI lived in Cicago for 35 years i love Chicago pizza THEIRS IS NO CHICAGO PIZZA.\nI don't know about the rest of the menu but you will be disappointed if you know pizza and expect a real Chicago experience. The dough is not right the ingredients are not seasoned enough. \nSo stay away from ordering Chicago Style unless you have money to waste
1 ||| This place has ok thai food.  I recently had lunch here with my boss on her suggestion that we should try this restaurant.  I ordered the chicken basil and it was ok.  I probably won't be back unless my boss really wants to go here again.
0 ||| I hate to rain on the love parade for this place, but my husband and I went last night for pedicures.  I called earlier in the day and MADE APPOINTMENTS.  When we got there we waited 20 minutes to even get to the pedi chairs.  My husband waited another 10 minutes before a technician even started with him.  During the service she cut his toe!  The upside of his service was that she gave an amazing leg and foot massage.  \n\nNow back to my experience.....basically my service didn't begin until 25 minutes AFTER I got seated in the pedi chair (did I mention we had appt. for 5pm)!  45 minutes after our stated appointment time, I finally saw my technician.  Unfortunely we had dinner reservations and had to leave in a limited time, so I basically got shafted on the massage!\n\nThe staff was apologetic about the timing, but first impressions are a killer.  I really don't think we will be going back.\n\nSorry Biagio:(
2 ||| When I had mentioned to my girlfriend I had never been to Postino's she said, REALLY???  Well then you are in for a treat.  She wasn't kidding!  Who said a wine bar won't get crowded in late June during 109 degree temperature???  And this was at their new location on Central (just north of Camelback). The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4, so we all got to pick and share...  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and Warm Artichoke Spread.  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself.  Anyone who knows me well, knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4...easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a week...yay!!!
2 ||| Dear Brunchies,\n\nThanks for forgetting the salsa with my enormously over sized, yet surprisingly tasty bacon and egg burro. I am unable to walk back over to your establishment to get salsa, therefore I am using ketchup. This is your fault. \n\nThe burrito is decent. It is huge and I got a lot of food for the amount of money I paid this morning. The tortilla has a really good flavor and I can't pinpoint what makes it so unique. I was also excited that the re-fried beans weren't salty! I would rather have bland re-fried beans and add salt to my preference. \n\nNot sure any of that helps, but if you order to go, make sure you double check for condiments!
4 ||| My favorite sushi spot ever!!!! Like I've mentioned in other sushi reviews, I love when they have a huge sushi menu and this place has MANY different rolls to try, it's fun!! I Love Sushi has at least 90!!! My husband and I's favorite is the Jackpot Special and we get it every single time we have dinner there. My friend was right about this place, the food and fish is very fresh!! If you're thinking about trying this place out, don't think twice, just go - you won't be disappointed. Get a good buzz going too, try their cold Raspberry sake. Btw, the service is good too!! They get pretty busy and packed during dinner time but it's usually not that long of a wait and it's always worth it to me.. The waitresses are very nice and the chefs are fun!\n\nUpdate (I've tried and graded these rolls/dishes to my liking):\n*Jackpot - A+\n*Boom Boom Nipple - A+\n*Franky Special - A+\n*Screaming Orgasm - A+\n*Monkey Roll - A+\n*Kiss of Fire - A+\n*Bam Bam - A\n*Tastes Like My Ex-GF - A\n*John Homes - A\n*Double D - A\n*Japanese Lasagna - A\n*I Love Sushi - A\n*Something Wrong #69 - B+\n*90% Special - B+\n*Sun Devil - B+\n*Sean's Special - B\n*Crazy Horse - B\n*Happy Ending - B-\n*Burning Your Stomach - B-\n*Garlic Butter Special - B-
4 ||| Cool Irish spot with a new outdoor patio. No food and a limited draft and bottled beer selection.  Free WiFi.  The hostess is gorgeous so I would drink there anytime.
3 ||| I really like the pizza and they deliver! It's a nice thin greasy style pizza. The toppings are a little scarce, but the price is good. Don't order sausage.
2 ||| The massage was good.  But if you're looking for a \"full service\" feeling this is mediocre at best.  The perfect word to describe it, is \"decent.\"  I'm on the phone with my sister talking about our experiences here (we both went at different times) and we're talking about how it's not bad, but when you want to spend money to relax and feel good about yourself, this doesn't accomplish the goal.  So... if you want a good/decent priced massage go.  If you want a \"spa day\" keep looking.  I know I have to do better research and pay a whole lot extra for Camelback Inn or something like that.  They really need to clean it up, make it not look so old/dirty.  :( I hate saying that, but it's the truth.  Too much competition to look like that these days.
4 ||| My favorite steakhouse in Madison. Consistently above average food and service meshed with a classic steakhouse atmosphere make it a top spot in town. \n\nWant a good drink and a great steak? Go. Now.
0 ||| Worst Italian food ever. Rude waiter. Decore very lame. Room full because of coupon customers. I don't know where other reviewers have gone but don't listen to them! Stay away.
1 ||| Guys it's Cracker Barrel - if you're not having a good time you either didn't know what Cracker Barrel is, or you're ordering the wrong stuff.\n\nIt's a breakfast place, so as soon as you sit down just give them the lunch menu back, because you don't want anything on it.  Then, open up the breakfast menu and find 'Uncle Hershels Breakfast' and order that.  Then eat it.  That's pretty much all you have to do.\n\nIf you actually haven't been to a Cracker Barrel before, then know this: There are about 1000 of them, and they're a country restaurant and a store that sells candy and beanie babies and a whole bunch of garbage that only an old person would want, but nobody's forcing you to buy the stuff, so just eat the breakfast and get over it.
3 ||| Yummy pho, Vegas price, of course, why wouldn't it be? Still, the pho broth was delicious, fresh noodles, perfect in every way. I randomly stopped by the right pho joint! There were so many along Spring Mountain.\n\nOh, my friend ordered roasted duck. As great as it looked, it was obviously previously frozen for some time. Tasted that way.
4 ||| Very well lit and clean.  I feel safe going to this gas station at any time, even in the middle of the night.  I have never been bothered by panhandlers or solictors like at the other gas stations in the area.
1 ||| Been here a couple times. The quality of the food seems to be going down, fast. The service is ok, but definitely not great. The wait for food in the drive through is pretty bad, for fast food drive thru. Won't be going here very often. Too bad, cause I used to like their breakfast.
1 ||| This place is not good. Unfortunately it is one of the only all ages venues for bands to play at in the metro area, so good bands get stuck here.\n\nThe stage area is awkwardly sanctioned off with caution tape separating the under/over 21 crowd. \n\nThe bar service in The band area is really awful. I had to wait ten minutes to get some waters. Bear in mind that there was nobody at the bar, so it wasn't because I was waiting in a huge line. The guy had major attitude too.\n\nThe sound guy is NOT good. The lighting in the main bar/pool table area is WAY too bright. \n\nPeople are going to get stuck going here to see local bands they like, but just know, the place is not a good venue so don't expect much.
2 ||| Tasty beef you cook yourself at a large open vented indoor grill. Chef will grill your steak for your for an additional charge of $2.79. Salad bar respectably populated with the usual fare, e.g., red beets, shredded cheese, broccoli, cottage cheese, etc.  Former site of the Round Barn Restaurant.  Overall good dependable and tasty. Not fancy. Wear comfortable shoes if you plan to cook.
1 ||| Their pizza is not awesome.  I have never lived around the corner or even relatively close for the sole reason that their pizza is so not awesome.  The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is because their bathroom makes a really nice spot to meet other men, if you know what I mean ;)  Their workers can be pretty tense and mean ;)
4 ||| There is every kind of comic book genre imaginable in this place.  Including the entire Akira series, which is amazing.  The staff is helpful, funny, and really into geek stuff.  It isn't hard for a collector to drop a hundred dollars in just one visit, because there are so many gems here.  The establishment is well organized, and I will most likely come back.
0 ||| I've tried so hard after countless opportunities that you guys had just to be an acceptable go to bike shop...you've failed just about every time.  Horrible customer service countless times, jobs not performed during the time frame they had presented, which was not much of a big issue, but the fact that they never informed me that they never started the work after leaving a bike there for over three days.  I get it, you're busy.  But if you keep telling me it will be done today, I'll assume it'll be done.  If you tell me you can work on it, I'll assume you'll work on it.  And when I call to figure out what's going on, don't cut me off and expect me not to be an angry customer.  But I'm sure I get it, you're happy with your repeat customers and don't plan on getting/keeping new ones.  Thanks anyway.
2 ||| State Street Brats was a fun stop last weekend, but the food was just mediocre. When I went to Madison many years ago & it was \"The Brat Haus,\" the food & brats were way better! I do have to admit the new version has some pluses, but the old place rocked.\n\nAs for service, it was just o.k. this weekend. I saw many lines this weekend, but none at this place & I definitely would not wait in a line to get in there.
4 ||| Awesome place.  This is a large facility that is really well maintained.  The staff members, everyone from the front counter person to the guys in the shooting range, were very nice and extremely helpful and patient with providing assistance, answering questions, and giving suggestions.
4 ||| I enjoy and occasional Starbucks Coffee and with the onset of fall, of course the Pumpkin Latte.  Recently I gave this location a couple visits and I'm not impressed.  One visit was around 8:30 a.m. on a weekday and the line was crazy long.  We turned around and left.  Good for them for being busy.\n\nOn a second visit, once again a morning, I powered through the line, waiting more than 15 minutes to order.  When ordering the staff was less than friendly.  I have been testing the new Starbucks Rewards program.  It is a bit confusing.  I have it on my smart phone and I also get offers now that I am enrolled.  I let the person know I had $2 off a sandwich.  She said \"do you have a code?\"  I said no.  She said \"well you have to have a code.  I can't redeem without a code.  Hurry up there's a line.\"  I said OK I may have deleted the email and I chalked it up to my fault.  I then went to pay with my phone app and the person said \"I'm new, I don't know how to use that.  We can't scan that.\"  Once again rushing me.  Befuttled I paid with cash and waited in line for my coffee to be served.  I do appreciate the staff might be stressed but it does not give a warm fuzzy to me when it's implied that I'm the problem.\n\nIf you are in a rush, this is not the place.  I've been to the Target and Hy-Vee locations which are rarely, busy.  Better yet, local owned places are more friendly.\n\nBased on multiple experiences I'll remember to go elsewhere.
1 ||| Overpriced and mediocre food at best.  The reason I gave this two stars  is because you can buy cool shirts.  Who doesn't want a Hard Rock Cafe Phoenix shirt? ...heh.\n\nI think the nostalgia has worn off on the Hard Rock Cafe after all these years.  It's no longer (not sure it ever has been) THE place to hang out at.  \n\nTwo stars because it's still the Hard Rock Cafe.
4 ||| This place is just plain fun. \n\nThe atmosphere is so lively and energetic, it's impossible not to have a good time. Big Dog's can't be beat on football Sundays, but be sure to stake out a table early, because the place gets packed. (I'm not even a football person, and I still enjoyed my experience at the Draft House, so that's saying something.)\n\nThe food and drinks are good, and the prices are reasonable. I've only eaten in the bar area, so I'm not sure what the restaurant part is like.
4 ||| My advice. Go with the fresh brick oven pizza, the sausage was succulent, the ricotta sweet and the crust perfect. The Sicilian style pizza I can not say the same for, it is a generic cheese thick crust already baked up an when someone orders toppings they simply slap them on and reheat the pizza with the toppings. Leaving the crust overly crisped like biting into a crouton and the toppings only slightly warmed. Anything that is made to order is a winner! Anything Pre made and waiting such as sides, sicilian, cake can be skipped without missing much.
2 ||| So we've been a couple times. It's a cute little place, reminiscent of the little corner ice cream place we went to as kids. Now this isn't Cold Stone quality stuff, but it's decent and cheap. Plus they have REAL Slush Puppies, old school style. It's a little confusing when you walk up, you can't tell whether they are taking orders at the window or inside the shop. Minor problem though.\n\nI was forced to deduct two stars, however, after I visited today. I ordered a small cookies and cream \"Flurry\" and was shocked, nay, FLABBERGASTED to learn that this place, which has the nerve to call itself a business, uses FAUX Oreo cookies. I don't even know if I can walk down the same street as this store ever again. They may as well have given me a Rocks and Gravel Flurry. A travesty, really.
4 ||| I found the reviews here surprising. The service I found to be good. The waitress we had was attentive and funny. The manager is a great guy and always comes to ask how everything is going. There side dishes are the best part. They always give you a lot of different options and are constantly refilling them. The barley tea that is free is also great with the meal. We ordered the seafood pancake and everyone absolutely loved it. Then we got galbi and bulgogi. The portions are big and everyone ended up stuffed. At the end of our meal they brought over this cold cinnamon tea that hit the spot. I will be returning here very soon.
2 ||| Every time I go into this restruant is always so busy. The food is delicious and one of a kind. But the service could use some inprovement ... When I ordered I wanted to get a gryo with fries the meal but the girl cut me off very quickly and didn't even try to up sale me to the meal so I had to go back in line to order my side. Also they call out number orders when they should give out table #s because its very hard to hear in there and I couldn't hear them yelling for any number over the crowd so having the table number would help people get there food faster. Lastly they did not quote me a time my food would be done for a Togo. I waited for 40 minutes to get my order not knowing when I  would get it. All in all good food poor service. Nice people just need to get things in order.
2 ||| SOLID 3 stars from me on my first and recent visit to Beef and Bottle. Old school, local steakhouse the sets the mood with dark lighting, carpeted floors and rat pack music in the background. We went on 1/2 price wine night, which is the way to go. Ordered the 14oz New York Strip med-rare and it came out perfect. Flavor was good, though I like a little more char on the outside. Came w/one side and the \"create your own salad\" for $34. Not bad and I appreciate the side included in the price. I ordered the button mushrooms and onion rings on the side, though the steak does come with an onion ring garnish.\n\nThe cheese & crackers are old school. Good cheese spread with crackers still in the packet. Reminds me of the supper clubs I grew up going to in the upper Midwest. I also add a chance to taste my wife's shrimp cocktail that she ordered as part of her filet combo special that night...just ok on the shrimp. They were small and had that recent defrosted taste to them, which was a downer. Service was friendly and attentive. It's a casual place where you can save some money and get a really good steak for the money.
4 ||| Agree with everybody who gave 5 stars: \"The BEST Japanese food in Arizona.\" \"It's a no nonsense ma & pa kind of place with good food.\" \n\nThey provide good size portions and are inexpensive.  I like the katsudon.
4 ||| My dad wanted to go to this place because he saw it on TV. I grew up on in dive bars plopped on stools next to my grandfather as he drank Budweisers. Thus we felt at home.\n\nThis is a dive bar. A real dive bar, not some phony hipster bar pretending to be a dive bar. Yes, its grimy, yes there will be people shaking from acute withdrawal sitting near you. If you have never been to a dive, or are not sure you have been to a dive, you might want to try somewhere else.\n\nBudweisers are 2.25, food is cheap and comes in huge portions. Pierogies are gargantuan, the fish sandwich is even bigger. Standard bar food on the menu with a few nice Polish selections. Service is nonchalant yet friendly enough. An elderly woman in the back does all the cooking by herself. She is awesome.
1 ||| Delivery was fast and the food arrived hot. The driver was polite and friendly.\n\nWe ordered Crab Puffs, Pot stickers, Spring Rolls, a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl, Shrimp and Broccoli, Chicken Chow Mien and Happy Family. Each meal came with fried rice.\n\nThe Crab puffs were ok. They were crispy and the cheese seemed in good ratio to the skin. \nSpring Rolls - Much like the crab puffs, crispy, but otherwise unremarkable.\nThe Pot stickers were terrible. Doughy with barely any filling. Huge, but what good is that if all you are eating is steamed dough?\nThe Chicken Teriyaki Bowl was mostly gristle and cartilage from the end of chicken legs. The rice in this case was mushy.\n\nThe Happy Family had plenty of nicely cooked veggies and shrimp. The sauce was very good and helped the undercooked rice soften. The other meats in the meal were shredded and barely noticeable.\n\nThe other three entrees were ok with the worse part being the rice. They don't sell fried rice on its own which disappointed us at first, but  now I'm glad they don't.\nThe amount of food was disappointing as well. The prices were similar to other places, and when we have ordered at those places, there is usually enough for lunch the next day.\n\nNot horrible, but I wouldn't go again.
1 ||| Not a very good take out experience.   We ordered a salad and 3 pasta dishes.  Salad was fine but all 3 pasta dishes disappointed\n\nPenne San remo was dry.   Spaghetti with meat sauce seemingly skipped most of the meat sauce and the Quattro al forno was a tiny portion for $21\n\nWould not suggest take out from buca.   The price/value relationship is way off
1 ||| 10/29/11 DINNER.\n\nMixed emotions on this one. Came hoping to love, left a little disappointed.\n\nME: Linguine w/ triple cream brie w/ toasted walnuts, mushrooms, prosciutto, fresh herbs & Parmesan. Added chicken for $3 more, per waiter's suggestion. There was brie, even some chunks, but it wasn't very strong, in aroma or flavor. (When I drank a sip of Point Noir with a bite, that seemed to bring out the brie.) There were absolutely no mushrooms, which were greatly missed in this dish. And there was hardly any prosciutto, again, missed. Basically I ended up with walnuts & chicken in linguine in a creamy cheese sauce. And I didn't need the chicken after all, I think the dish would've been better without it. Overall, an OK dish, but not as interesting since it didn't follow the menu description. (FOLLOWUP: I had some left over the next day, and it actually improved in brie flavor having set overnight in the fridge.)\n\nSPOUSE: Filet Oscar, which was  the classic filet of beef topped w/ king crab and Bearnaise sauce, w/ asparagus, then drizzled w/ Cabernet sauce, all on top of leek mashed potatoes. OK, there was a POOL of Cabernet sauce, and hardly any Bearnaise. The beef was good, for a filet, and exactly as ordered, rare. But for the money spent, spouse wasn't thrilled. Good, not great. His meal did come with choice of a salad or soup, he chose butternut squash soup, which was good, tasted more like pumpkin, earthy & sweet.\n\nDESSERT: We split the pear dessert, which was again good, not great. We also split a glass of Chilean dessert sauvignon blanc, which the waiter brought in separate glasses, a nice touch. The wine was recommendable: fruity, aromatic, not too sweet.\n\nWINES: All we drank were wines-by-the-glass. It was nice to find a Patricia Green Pinot Noir on a by-the-glass list. The cheaper-line-by-Schraumsberg Mirabelle sparkling rose was better than I had expected. (LONG time ago, I had tried Mirabelle Brut and thought it smelled/tasted like bug spray! Obviously Schramsberg has improved the wines on their secondary program!) And the nebbiolo was fine. But the bill for 4 glasses of wine skyrocketed the cost of our experience.\n\nSERVICE/VENUE: Attentive, nice waiter. Nice setting. (We had to sit outside, cuz it was crazy full inside, but the heater sufficed for the outdoors at night.)\n\nOVERALL: If we had not had our $50 Groupon with us, we would've paid $170+ for this meal, which I found rather crazy. I'm glad I finally tried Grape Street, but I won't go outta my way to return.\n\nPS: I wish we could have tried the food at Nora's Wine Bar, which closed recently. The only day we visited, we only got to do wines. THAT menu looked incredible, authentic Italy Italian, AND they had a fantastic selection of wines by the glass as well. Sigh.
3 ||| good staff
3 ||| Great pancakes and free refills on soda, as soon as I finished the first drink the waitress came with another drink immediately. Friendly staff and fast service (5PM).\n\n- The toilets were not clean.
4 ||| I really enjoyed the Pad Thai from this place. They can even specialize yours by making it more spicy if you want. \n\nIt always seemed like this place was dead, but their food was really good at a reasonable price and the staff was friendly and fast, so I don't know why. \nPaking was a little annoying though, but I guess all of downtown is kinda like that.
4 ||| Parthenon is great and definitely the best Gyros in Madison. You're gonna pay about $10 for a gyro with fries and a soda. My family and I came here a lot in college and would order a basket of fries (or two depending on how hungry we are) to share between the four of us. They also put a lot of onions on the gyro so be prepared to pick some off or ask for one without onions. Even my mom, who loves onions, has to take some off sometimes.
0 ||| Completely different from what I've read or expected. Experience was weird for us. Vibe was a little off, and the bar area was too crowded. The back where the lounge is was empty and creepy.
4 ||| I feel like nothing screams Charlotte as much as Lupie's cafe. Having grown up here, I cannot remember a time without Lupie's. The food is always consistent & very reasonably priced. I'll admit it is not blow your mind good, but its pretty darn tasty. The staff is always pleasant. If you're ever in the Huntersville area, they have a sister location up there.
2 ||| I think that Dr Fisher is an absolutely amazing vet.  My Lab and I have been visiting him for the last 3 years and he has always been very informed, extremely empathetic and always efficient.  I have never once felt rushed; he answers all my questions, encourages me to ask more and makes me feel welcomed and my dog feels well cared for.\n\nSo why a 2-star rating?\n\nFrom my first visit, the receptionist has always seemed cold, unconcerned and distant.  To but it bluntly, I simply don't like her and it's unpleasant dealing with her.  I have never once see her smile and that does seem to perfectly fit her personality.\n\nOn my last visit, Dr Fisher was away and I got to see a replacement vet.  She was the opposite of everything Dr Fisher has been.  I had to coax information out of her.  Even with extreme prodding, I came home with only a marginal understanding of how to administer the meds that she had prescribed (and finally had to look online to get the answers I needed).\n\nPlus, that last treatment - for an ear infection in my Lab - wound up costing me $173 which I thought was simply outrageous.  I am accustomed to paying a premium at Oasis, and so far it's felt well worth it for Dr Fisher's expertise.  This time, it felt simply over the top and I felt I received very little value for that money.\n\nSo, reluctantly, I have made my dog's next appointment with Sunridge Animal Hospital next door.  I am told that their pricing is extremely reasonable and their service is just as exceptional.  When I made my appointment, the receptionist was instantly a 100x improvement over Oasis's, so at least I have that to look forward to.  I will post a review there when I get to know them better.
2 ||| The fitting rooms looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while dirty tortillas on the ground...Ok over all, good selection but not the cleanest Target I've been to. (This was the Ahwatukee Target store)
4 ||| 9 minutes to get sitted\n1.30 minutes for service\nWaitress has provided me really good service. So far. (Waitress name carlos)\nTotal was 15.44\nReally good price\nLoved the experience
0 ||| Oye - CAH-RIST - Worst grooming department customer service EVER.\n\nI wish I could do a separate grooming review from the day staff, who are usually quite nice - one woman in particular who has worked there for years has always been a delight.  I have typically run over to this PetSmart during my lunch break, as it is close to my office.  I have literally spent THOUSANDS of dollars here on cat food/treats/litter/toys/other feline related crap, but never again after the shit goon I had to deal with in their grooming department.  And I would love to call him out specifically, but since he never bothered to get up off of his ass and chose to yell at me from around a corner, I can't even do that.\n\nNew kitteh is 2 years old and still has her claws.  And when I say claws, I mean razor sharp talons that were seemingly made for shredding curtains and skin.  I took her here on 12/23, first thing in the morning, and quickly got her checked in and I thought had her nails trimmed.  Less than 2 weeks later, they were back to talons again - what the frack?  Anywho, I raced home one evening after work, tossed her yowling butt in her carrier and raced over to PetSmart, getting there around 5:30 (the website and the person that I talked to said grooming was staffed until 9:00 - staffed and working are 2 different beasts, apparently).\n\nI opened the door to the grooming parlor and as if either Jeebus or Oz was talking at me, I heard a disembodied voice.\n\nVoice:  Can I help you?\nMe:  Hi, I need to get my cats nails trimmed, please.\nVoice: Ummmm, our cat groomers are gone for the day, you'll have to come back tomorrow.\nMe:  I just need her nails to be trimmed:\nVoice: Ummmm, our cat groomers are gone for the day, you'll have to come back tomorrow.\nMe:  I won't be back tomorrow.\nVoice:  Okay.  Whatever.\n\nSeriously?  You can't be bothered to walk 5 feet and turn a corner, but I am going to leave my beloved fur baby with you?  No ma'am!  I was annoyed that there was no one there to do her nails, contrary to what the website and the person that answered the phone had led me to believe, but the poor customer service is what did it (though, reading these reviews, I see that their grooming department isn't necessarily stellar).\n\nI went to Pet Supplies Plus on Hwy 51 at Carmel Commons - ALL FOUR PEOPLE working when I took her in could trim claws, and they charged me $7 less and did a fabulous job (I love a person who can hold them and trim their nails instead of noosing them up on the table).  It's easier to get to from where I live, plus I can stop at McD's for a milkshake (to bring the boys to my yard).\n\nDay floor staff/cashiers get a 4, night staff cashiers get a 2.5, whomever was staffing the grooming salon that night gets a punch in the junk.  FAIL!
4 ||| It's a must to stop into Osaka anytime I'm in Vegas! \n\nService is great, food's yummy and there's many options, and I love the vibe in the restaurant! I can lounge and sip on sake or do sake bombs with help from the chefs!
1 ||| We ordered a Bobbie and a Turkey sandwich. The place was dirty and the bread was dry and old. The Bobbie is the sandwich I really wanted to try, and it was awful. The inside of it was kinda frosty too. The turkey sandwich had dry bread too. I gave them 2 stars because the boys working there were nice. Maybe this location is different than the rest? I will never go back!
1 ||| Not sure what has happened but the prices are higher and the quality is poor (stay away from the shrimp!). \n\nNo real witty way to say it...they are off my Thai list forever. Good thing there are a plethora of uberfab places in the Chandler area!
3 ||| I've tried several of the smoothies here and they're all pretty good. Blimey Limey and Sunrise Sunset are my favorite since I don't like banana. On my most recent visit I tried the Sunrise Salsa. It's a breakfast burrito with salsa. Not bad. In the past I've had some of the chicken wraps and they've been ok. They are fresh and better than any fast food sandwiches. Also it's open 24 hours.
4 ||| We went for a family birthday party and everyone in our group really enjoyed their meals. They printed a personalized \"happy birthday\" message at the top of our menus which was a nice touch. The service took about 2.5 hours which was slow but not awful for a party of 9 people. We will definitely be back!
3 ||| I was referred by another upholstery shop because the shop did not have foam for me to purchase, they were strictly an upholstery shop. I went to the shop to purchase foam for my used sofa and chair, with measurements in hand. The staff member told me I should have bought the covers so they could put the covers on the foam for me, if would probaby be difficult for me.; this was on Saturday. On Monday morning at 8:00am, I took in the covers of the sofa and chair, for 3 seats and 3 pillows, dropped them off and they were ready for me by 12:00 noon.  Excellent, excellent work; price was amazing.  You can't go wrong!
0 ||| The server/cashier was pleasant but had dirt under his nails.  Was very turned off when he handed me the food.  They keep slices in the back so you cant see them which with slices I like to see to know how fresh they are. The slices weren't great either.
0 ||| They refused to let me switch out fried rice for chow mein. The food was mediocre, chicken was dry and my friend got a crab puff that had absolutely nothing in it. The flavor was bland for everything too. The restaurant itself was really run down.
4 ||| Excellent place, super friendly staff. It's under construction.. remodeling it but still much better selection than \"neighborhood Wal-Mart\" for healthier organic foods.
4 ||| Best pizza and Italian food in Oakland PERIOD!!!! Nice family owned establishment . Great food, great prices.
2 ||| Reviewing just the casino. And that's quite enough. \n\nResearching my trip to death, a common theme was to check out \"the places where the locals go\". Promises of loose slots, friendlier dealers, food deals, lower table minimums, etc. \n\nMrs. H. and I were just driving around, took the left off of LVB onto Sahara, and bumped into Palace Station. \n\nMe: \"Oh yeah!....,these are the joints I've been hearing about! These are the hidden gems that the locals go to!\".\n\nMrs. H: \"ummmmm...ok\"\n\nThe breakdown: Stinky and smelly. Hard to imagine eating there, so it went no further than my imagination. There's signs everywhere for Louie Anderson. I just want to write him, give him 5 or 10 bucks, and tell him that I know things aren't great right now, but you don't need the work this bad...stay out of this place, Louie! \n\nDealers had kinda pissy attitudes, largely due to a couple of players that were probably forced to leave the shelter in the daytime because that's when you're supposed to be looking for jobs. My luck, my mood, and the dealer's moods, seemed to be affected by this. \n\nMeantime, Mrs. H. was working her slot magic and stayed sort of even, but I don't know if this means we can vouch for loose slots or not. I can, however, vouch for the odor of mildewy, paneled, shag carpeted, nicotine stained rec room, though. \n\nWe went along on our way, back onto Sahara, then further south, where we found my new love, the Silverton Lodge. That's another review. But for now, happy friggin trails, Palace Station.
3 ||| The fact that Einstein Bagels is usually massed with patrons in the morning is a sign that the Las Vegas Valley has a need for more bagel shops.\n   After living in New York, Einstein Bagels trails behind mom and pop bagel shops in value and quality. For the record Einstein Bagels attempted to go into the New York market, and failed in a couple months. A BLT special with coffee in a New York bagel shop is a great deal less expensive than Einstein Bagels.\n  At any rate, this is a good place to have breakfast. It is convenient to Henderson's Galleria Mall business district. Theirs coffee, with unlimited refills, is coffee shop quality. And there is a sufficient amount of vacant parking spaces at the adjoining vacant Borders.\n  On this visit they slightly jumped the shark by not letting customers order the $5 BLT special to noon. C'mon. Still it was not much of a jump to lower my rating.
4 ||| Dr. Dachs and everyone at Thompson Peak Family Dental rock!\n\nThey are top-notch.\n\nI give them an unconditional recommendation.
1 ||| The service part person was rude and had a bad attitude.  We will go to the Internet for parts next time rather than making the drive. The two stars was for the nice selection of things in the store.
3 ||| Pho Saigon 8 is my bf's favorite pho place. So by osmosis, I guess its mine, too. He says they have the best broth. I ... can't tell. It all tastes great to me. All pho is good. I don't know. \n\nEverything else is typical Viet joint. Tacky decor, unsanitary-looking bathrooms, curt but quick service, portions are huge (big bowls of pho for ~$8). The menu is concise, standard Viet. They actually have stuff, too. We've been to other joints and ordered menu items that are no longer available. They haven't been available. They will never be available. What, you can't change the menu or something? \n\nOne time, on a whim, we just tried the pennyworth drink. Had no idea what it was. It tasted like grass. Mental note: just stick with the coconut. \n\nAs much as I mediocre-like this place, pho is always a great solution to a hangover. Cheers. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino
2 ||| I visited Charlotte and decided to go here, cause it was crowded. The wait was 35-50 minutes. I really didn't know what to choose --- so i end up ordering Beer Battered Fish and Chips (os os) and the ribs and chicken combo w/ fries (os os). There was nothing really special about the food. Charlotte doesn't have much to offer when it comes to food =P
1 ||| This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.
3 ||| Best Vietnamese in Pittsburgh. The quality of the food in amazing. The service is, as most places with delicious food, not incredible. I don't let that bother me, as the food is worth a drive. I love the chicken pho, and also the curry vermicelli. I enjoy a Vietnamese coffee on occasion, and have sampled most everything on the relatively small menu. Many plates of spring rolls and fresh rolls have passed through my lips, and as I type this I honestly don't know why I am not there right now. In fact, I tried to go there today, but unfortunately they're closed Mondays. Bring cash!
4 ||| My husband and I recently signed up and I really like this location.  There are tons of classes that are included in the membership.  I've tried yoga, pilates, Zumba and aqua fit so far and have really enjoyed all of them.  It helps prevent me from getting bored with the gym.  I would recommend this location, but check to see if your employer has a pre-negotiated rate with them.  I was able to sign up online and  didn't have to deal with sales.  We walked in, got our key tags and were on our way.  YAY!
3 ||| Bring cash only. Good for an after dinner drink.
3 ||| This place is located in the heart of the capital city next to the Hilton hotel. \n\nThey have a somewhat limited selection, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The sides are sold separate of the entree as is the case in most Chophouse's.
3 ||| In Michigan, you can purchase beer at the grocery store. In Pennsylvania you have to visit \"beer world\". The good thing about beer world was they had Yuengling beer in 24 packs and a great selection of other beers. Now you have to purchase them in huge quantities but when you are looking to transport it back a couple states at least it makes your trip to the store worth it.
1 ||| Their buffet was horrible. I'm sitting here now writing this review on my phone because it was that bad. I tried their eggs but they tasted synthetic. They were watery and powdery tasting. Tater tots were old and stale. \n\nDon't eat the desert cake. It tasted like licking the inside of a refrigerator. Their selection of fruit was limited and possibly partially consumed. \n\nService was nice but also sketchy. We got coffee with a lipstick stain on the rim. Can you say health hazard?
3 ||| Hand Sanitizer on every table- Nice!\n\nThis place is small -I hope you enjoy rubbing elbows with the next table. Despite the close quarters, this restaurant offers quality Thai food at reasonable prices. They feature lunch specials that include a delicious soup, egg roll, white rice, and your choice of entree. I chose the chili mint with sliced chicken (Level 5). The soup was fantastic! At first glance it looked like a bunch of celery in a clear broth that I wasn't excited to try. But of nowhere, it smacks you with complex flavors that will make your head spin. Wait, was that a spicy bite I just had? Hah, what was that crunch? AMAZING!\n\nMy only small complaint was that the chicken was a little overdone, as well as the rice. Have you ever eaten burnt rice that was stuck to the bottom of the rice cooker? Yeah-- that! However, the flavor combination that the chicken chili mint had was so good and spiced perfectly. Finally -a restaurant that doesn't skimp on ingredients. I would definitely come back -at a less busy time so I don't have to have the guy next to me breathing on me. Good thing the hand sanitizer was close by.......
1 ||| Eesh. I'm going to try to avoid this place. I'll admit it's not my style at all though it suits others just fine: not veg friendly, not energetic, not worth the money. I don't have to eat like a health nut to enjoy my food, but even their french fries suck. And that's my main criteria for judging mediocre venues with limited meatless fare. You could earn an entire star with good french fries despite a crappy atmostphere. Native New Yorker? Fail.\n\nThe other food I saw wandering around looked pretty, um, bad...from what I hear the pizza is especially unappetizing. The waitstaff was average and on the slow side. The beer selection is ok and I sat contently with my Stella. But overall this is not my scene.
3 ||| Really good service and atmosphere.  Food was good, but over-spiced and definitely pricy.  I would go back, just not very often.
3 ||| I had high hopes going here since it's right next door to an awesome outdoor sporting goods store and Omega Sports did not disappoint.  Right away I found a couple pair of Nike tempo track shorts that I had to have since they actually had a wide variety of colors to choose from.  When I go to Dick's Sporting Goods they usually only have boring colors or they'll have an entire rack full of the color I want but only in size XXL.  Next I moved on to the shoe section where I found a pair of my favorite Nike Vomero running shoes on clearance for about $30 less than the going rate online.  Then I ended up sifting through the bathing suits and found a cute, good quality suit that was marked down 50%.  \n\nThe employees were all very helpful and knowledgeable.  They have a treadmill set up in the corner.  I'm assuming this is to analyze your gait and determine what type of shoe is best for you but I didn't get to see it in action.\n\nWhen I got to the counter the manager offered to give me a pretty good discount if I bought a second pair of the shoes I was already buying.  She only had one pair left in the store in the same size and she wanted to get rid of them.  I probably would've taken the bait had the shoes not already been a 1/2 size too big.  \n\nI will definitely be back to hunt for more treasures soon.
1 ||| If I were just reviewing for the food, my review would be much higher.. But, considering this was the absolute slowest service I've had in as long as I can remember, that cannot go forgotten. \n\nOur server seated us in a section with only one other group there and first made us wait about 8 minutes before even bringing us water and menus. Of course, we had to wait far longer than necessary before we could order. We decided to each get entrees and then split an appetizer. By this time, the other group in our section had already left (so in other words, this place is not busy, and in fact fairly empty) and we had  to wait over 30 or 40 minutes for our *appetizer*. The waiting's not over. Then the waitress brought out my friends' food about 10 full minutes before mine. (By this time, it had already been at least an hour from when I ordered), \n\nQ. Did I order something special or difficult? \nA. No. I ordered soup. \n\nBy the time it came for paying and getting our check, we thought our server must have gone on break or something. It was beyond ridiculous how inattentive she was.\n\nThe entire experience took about 2 hours in total in a not-busy restaurant. Good thing the food was fairly tasty, but that wasn't enough to get out the bad taste in my mouth about the service.
2 ||| I don't know why this place is called \"sky harbor.\" I imagine a high rise airport for space ships. It's alright. Not bad, not extraordinary. Lot's of walkways. If you have a connecting flight, move faster!
0 ||| I'm only leaving one star because I have to, but I have gave this store several chances and they continue to disappoint. The customer service when I come in the morning is atrocious. I ask for my egg sand which needs to be toasted because it's cold, and the woman just stares at me with a \"Are you kidding me look\" , then she just throws the veggies everywhere on my sand which and tries to rush me out of the door. Did I forget to mention that I had wait there over 5 minutes before she even came out?!?!? I will just go to another subway . Thanks!!!
3 ||| Burrito as big as your thigh! Could be thicker, but I'm spoiled because of SF's El Farolito... Definitely stop by Los Tacos if you want a good taco or burrito and are in the hood; Not really worth the trip if you're not. Veggie burrito didn't come with rice, but the beans were really good.
4 ||| A top notch Bermuda-laced track located in the golf corridor of Fountain Hills and home to the infamous Wicked Six.  The course was in excellent condition, especially the back nine.  Tee boxes were in good condition but a few needed some re-seeding.  The fairways were in excellent condition, easily delineated from the rough which was burnt-out Bermuda.  The greens, as some recent reviews have noted, were not as fast as most Phoenix-area resorts courses but they hardly turn play into a round of \"pasture golf\".  Chip and runs and long putts need to be given an extra bit of muscle but it's not like your putting on unkept muni course back East. \n\nScoring on the front nine is a must because once you make the turn, your golf game can turn ugly fast.  Whatever tees your playing, the uphill climb of the final eight holes, especially the aptly termed, Wicked Six, turns what's nominally on the scorecard to something literally 400 yards longer.  The wide open fairways are forgiving but  even the scratch golfer will be pulling out his 3 wood, 4, 5, and 6 irons on this stretch of holes.  \n\nSunRidge Canyon is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination and there are better courses in the Phoenix area but the scenery, modest green fees (by Phoenix standards) and back nine alone is worth the price of admission.
4 ||| So, clearly the musician's make the night.  Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  \n\nSome fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.\n\nThe musician's interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool.  This makes everyone involved feel like they're in the scene.
0 ||| Went here once, had some kind of chicken that I think was frozen, not fresh. The sauce tasted like something out of a can I think, it was definitely not home made. Will not return...
1 ||| Update: came here for lunch with a group of 6. Ordered and still waiting for our food after an hour. Waitress was not polite at all.
4 ||| NOTE:  2000 South Blvd., Suite 200 is the correct Address for Elder Gallery at Atherton Mill - Somehow the Address was changed to the Address for Elders other Gallery on South Blvd.  So if you want to see this Gallery in addition go to Both Addresses!  \n\nElder Gallery has had shows in this space in Atherton Mill before and Currently they have an Exhibition of works by Carl Plansky: \"A Lifetime of Painting\".  This is a large collection of mostly Large paintings.\n\nThis is a great  \"Warehouse\" look cool space, a bit rough in an old mill (Atherton Mill).  Suite 200 on the side near the Pizza place.  Limited hours, call ahead!
2 ||| I was in town for two days and our hotel recommended this place, calling it \"updated Southern.\" We were a little disappointed when we walked in, because it looked corporate and impersonal - everything that we didn't want. \n\nBut then I saw the menu.  There were so many really interesting looking things on it that I wish I was with a bigger group so there could have been more ordering and sharing. I ended up starting with a goat cheese, beet and orange salad. With those ingredients, you can't really go wrong, and they didn't. \n\nFor dinner, I had scallops that were encrusted with bacon crumbs on top of a pumpkin bread crustini. Really amazing flavors between the bacon, scallops and the pumpkin. My colleague also really enjoyed his pecan encrusted trout. \n\nBottom line: boring corporate setting, the opposite of boring food.
4 ||| This place surprised me, the food is pretty great.  I ordered takeout, and arrived to find a huge line early on a Saturday afternoon.  Once I got the food home I learned why.  This is the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix for sure.  Everything seemed quite fresh, and was closer to the type of Chinese food I am used to (coming from the Northeast).  Not bad at all.
2 ||| Decent, consistent Mexican food!
1 ||| this place is totally overpriced, and they're sloppy. i got a mani-pedi and was underwhelmed when i went home with nail polish all over my fingers *and* nails. as i was drying my nails, someone messed up the woman's nails next to me, even though she was very specific about what she wanted (and what she was asking wasn't that complicated!). also, the massage chairs suck. not that i expect a ton from a mechanical massage, but it was really annoying to have my chair out -of-control shaking for about 20 minutes as if i were sitting on a broken dryer. i finally had them just turn it off. i'm being harsh, i know, but with what they charge, ya gotta be. \n\nlet's just say i'll be searching out a new nail place.
2 ||| I usually choose this theater out of convenience alone. It is right near me and I prefer a Harkins theater over AMC for price. \n\nMy son and I go see most every new PG13 movie and under so you can imagine how expensive that can get. Especially during the summer. But we pack our dollar refill movie cups and our Harkins t-shirt that offers you a free medium popcorn or a $1 upgrade to a large. So we make out pretty cheap for a mommy son movie date!\n\nThe employees here are always really nice and usually open a new register when they see the lines getting long. It's always cool inside, sometimes too cool. I usually bring a sweater. And when we leave a movie someone always asks my little boy what he thought of the movie. It's not the nicest location, or the cleanest I've been to but it does what it is supposed to do. \n\nThe show must go on...\n\nXo,\nReesie
4 ||| It's a mall. In Madison. It's exactly what you'd expect. \n\nThe interior has been spruced up and there are some new stores, but West Towne still wins.  If you really need to shop, get outta town and head to Milwaukee or Chicago.
4 ||| Me and my friend went here for her birthday weekend and it was great. I was a little hesitant because I'm not real big on spicy/cajun food, but surprisingly I enjoyed everything about this place. The place is a house turned into a restaurant and has that cool New Orleans french quarter feel. \n\nThe fried pickles are AMAZING!! The Diamond watch out!! I had the blackened catfish with mashed potatoes and it was delicious. I was shocked that I had two pieces of fish as well which was even better. My friend had \u00e9touff\u00e9e and she enjoyed her meal as well. I will definitely be back here again for some more yummy spices!!
1 ||| Rolled Taco special was a bit disappointing. The tacos were not crunchy and were soft in the middle, leading to the ultimate rolled taco  soggy mess. It was 4 bucks for rolled tacos without carne asada, but 7 bucks with the meat and thats the only thing that is special about the special order. The Carne asada was average at best, too chewy and not all the fat trimmed away. Guacamole overwhelmed the five skinny tacos and cheese was not melted great. Horchata needed more taste, as the classic flavors of vanilla and cinnamom were tough to detect. PLace might be good for drunken students, but the experienced Mexican drive through tongue knows the truth.
2 ||| I drove through rush-hour traffic to get here.  It better be good, I'm thinking.  My dad was visiting, and by \"visiting,\" I mean he came to trade a vehicle and visit a friend of his in Chandler.  Somehow I fell into the mix because of a pull-out sofa I guess.  Being a fan of Sonoran Mexican food, rather than New Mexican, I was skeptical.  Admittedly I have limited experience with New Mexican food, but usually I find the meat to be over-seasoned and the chili to be too hot for my taste.  However, these good people in Chandler are from the same small town along the border I am,  so I trusted their taste was similar to mine, and I was not disappointed.\n\nFive stars from the top by serving four different dips with the hot, crisp tortilla chips (green, red, bean, and sour-cream based).  All were spicy, but addictive.  Only the first basket is free, but better than nuthin'  (I'm talking to you Mr. Carlsbad Tavern).  I had the flauta dinner after confirming they are made with corn, not flour tortillas.  Both the beef and the chicken were flavorful, but not overly seasoned.  I really liked the beans as well.  My husband had the chicken gorditas.  The chicken was, unfortunately, really dry.  \n\nIt was a Friday night, and in spite of being extremely busy, we had excellent service as well.  Not even knocking off for the dry chicken.  Especially since I wasn't the one eating it.  Would I drive back to Chandler just to eat here?  Probably.  Just not during rush hour.  And why do they call it \"rush-hour.\"  No one was rushing anywhere on the 101.  I am so glad I work from home.
3 ||| My SUV is 13 years old and has never had a wax job. The finish was dull and faded. Full Circle restored my vehicle's finish like new in about 3 hours.
1 ||| For about 10+ years my family has gone to macaroni grill often and for special occasions like birthdays. Over the last 2 to 3 years the restaurant has been in a steady decline in terms of quality. Our most recent and last visit included the new \"half pound meatball dishes\" which ended up absolutely nothing like the picture for the TV advertisement. First, the pound of food was about 4 ounces of meatball and 12 ounces of pasta. Second, the pasta lacked flavor and in my case only had a few pieces of sliced mushroom. Everyone at our table was not happy with their meal after having given the restaurant tour three visit chances. The bread is still good, the key on today is good and the waitstaff continue to be relatively decent. Unfortunately, this is the last time and there are other similar options whereby the food is much better and they seem to care more.
0 ||| First of all Service was Awful-   from the cranky old lady who sat us and read thru a script of stuff  while were trying to enjoy the view and start our evening. We said thank you and gave signs it was time for her to leave.         \n\nThen our waiter pushed the cocktails when we ordered a beer and martini  and then he tried again  later heard the waiters talking near our sections about some contest for drink orders.   But this place charges too much for the Applebee's style service.  \n\nAnyways the Prime Rib was good  but how do you mess that up when you have Lawry's in your name...     the fish was ewwwww and the rest was forgetable.   \n\nSave you Money and go Somewhere else.     The only thing worth a star is the View.    Staff was Awful and worthless.     Hopefully they close this place and put in a another concept, in that great location.
4 ||| Apparently all it takes is a well known name to make the crowds flock and \"ohh and ahh\" over a building. For a Frank Lloyd Wright building, the Monona Terrace is not at all spectacular. In comparison to works such as Fallingwater, the Monona Terrace is nothing more than a typical community center with awkwardly placed bathrooms and lots of escalators. The convention center relies heavily on the Wright's name to draw interest, and has dedicated large portions of the interior to pictures and plaques depicting him and his life.\n\nWhile the exterior mimics the fluidity of the two lakes between which it sits, the inside is stifling and lacks a natural feeling. There is a distinct rigidity inside, that seems unnatural when paired against the view of the lake from the big glass windows. The carpets are a burnt orange/red color, and the conference rooms are small. Once filled, the tables and bodies are akin to sardines stacked neatly on top of one another. The rooftop offers some views worth taking in, once you get away from the tables and the areas being set up for special events. \n\nThe convention center does not permit outside food, except for wedding cakes. So the food was hit or miss. Potatoes were served with just about every meal, mostly as \"salad\" (which was odd when paired with Mexican styled foods). No bottles of water were made available, the most convenient beverages were cans of soda. \n\nService as a whole was odd. Wait staff barely allowed plates to near empty before swooping in. The bartenders, however, rocked. They were friendly, chatty, and they were great with remembering faces and desired beverages. Only once during my four days in the building did I see anyone representing the building other than wait staff.\n\nAs a whole - I was not impressed with the Monona Terrace, this \"beautiful\" building that I had heard so much about... If anything, it distracts from the natural beauty of Lake Monona.
0 ||| I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factorys over the years, all over the west.  This one... never again.\n\nWe went for lunch.  Terrible service and it's just way too expensive for what you get.  It took 3 tries to get me the lunch I ordered.  The first try was just wrong, the second try was closer but still wrong, finally the third try was right... she kept bringing someone else's burger.  And what a disappointment it was.  The burger could not have been more than a 1/3 lb with 2 pieces of thin bacon, cheese and 2 onion strings for $11.50.  It was a $7 or $8 burger at best.\n\nAfter the DOUBLE mistake, the waitress was flustered and pathetic.  And of course, offered nothing for the trouble.  At the very least a manager could have stopped by to apologize.  \n\nCF used to be know for their creativity, portion size, and great service.  Well things have definitely changed.  Now you get small to average sized portions and terrible service.  I guess that may be why you don't have to wait an hour for a table anymore.  Sad
4 ||| This is a beautiful restaurant! It has beautiful high ceilings and is very well kept. Went there for dinner with my boyfriend and the food was delicious! Our waiter was very polite and attentive. We will definitely be back!
0 ||| No internet, still.  No hot water, unless you let it run for 30 minutes to get to a luke warm temp.  Weird sandy/gritty residue on sheets.  Hard beds....the pillow top doesnt help much.  All of this combined means I didnt get any work done and I slept pretty crappy, with no nice hot shower to wash it all away.
0 ||| This place sucks. Came for their roast duck and roast pork--supposed specialties. Saw a new roast pig hanging already chopped 1/3 in and new ducks hanging. What came out was a different animal altogether. Old pork reheated and the bony part/ lower segment of a drumstick and a neck piece--a neck piece, WTF!!!  Perhaps they realized we were not locals, but money is money...it should buy the same food. Their vegetables were so old--and it was what they recommended. So disappointed in their food quality and dishonesty. We used to come here years back. However, need only to be duped once. We will never return here--not worth my time or energy to step foot into this place again!!! No stars if possible, but min. 1 per yelp rules.
0 ||| The term \"you get what you pay for\" wouldn't even apply to this Energy Tanning. In other words, it sucks and it's still expensive. When I was looking around for a place to tan a few months ago, I had stopped by this one just because I happened to drive by. \n\nI would feel bad for writing such a bad review for their facility if the staff was nice to me, but they were anything but nice. The place wasn't busy at all and still treated me like he was too busy for me. The guy didn't even know anything about the beds/lotion, or he didn't care.\n\nI defiantly did not sign up here and I wouldn't recommend it to others.
4 ||| Hands down a great thai restaurant.   I ordered the Tom Yum Veggie Soup because of all the yelper's great experience, however, I thought the soup had a bit too much lemon juice.  Aside from that, my husband and I enjoyed a great meal.  We ordered the Fresh Tofu Roll, Spicy Beef Basils and Chicken Pad Thai.  It seems that no one talks about this number system of how spicey they should make your food.  The waiter asks if how spicey it should be from 1 to 10 (being the hottest).  We picked a number 4 and the Spicy Beef Basils was still very spicy.  The Pad Thai was delicious and amazing.  All together our bill came out to be $32.  We will definitely go here again very soon!
4 ||| One nice thing about living back in the Las Vegas area is knowing I have the BEST Vet for my cat.  Dr. Terry Muratore is the most honest, compassionate vet that there is!  He has the same GREAT staff that stay there!  Why?  He's that damn good!  Terry's son Anthony works there as well.  It's a GREAT feeling to support a family run business.  Terry's honesty and integrity are an example for all to follow.  Today, I thought it was something MAJOR!  Terry took me back to show me my cat's X ray and explain everything to me!  In more than 35 years of dealing with vets, he is the ONLY one to do so!  How many vets make you wait, then just tell you what is wrong?  How do you really know?  Take your cat or dog to a vet you can TRUST!  They love your pets almost as much as you do!   It seems like they always have strays there to get adopted.  Do they have to do this?  No.  It's not a money thing where they try ripping you off.  They have pride in what they do!  Go to Legacy if you want the best.  If you try the rest, I wish you luck, you will need it!
4 ||| BEST Chinese!  I've been a customer for almost twenty years & they are amazing.  Restaurant is comfortable with nice atmosphere & the food is perfection!  Great prices, too.  SUPER nice staff.  NEVER had a bad meal there in nearly 20 years and Chinese is my favorite!
1 ||| i'm confused.  i tried this place without looking at a review and i give it a 2 star.  but honey bears has a 4 star rating.  that's why i'm confused.  not sure if it was a bad day or what is going on.\n\nthe food was average to below average.  i did finish my food but that was about it.  my family was not to impressed either.\n\nthe inside experience was okay too.  after we left this restaurant we decided to never come back again.  but after reading so many positive reviews i'm may give it a second chance.
1 ||| Quick, standard take-out pretty much sums this place up. I got the chicken broccoli and the bf got General's chicken, both with white rice. Sadly, the rice was a little overcooked, but not inedible. My chicken and broccoli (my standard take out request) was really good. The broccoli was cooked nicely, as was the chicken, and the sauce was great! Not too thick, not too thin and had a nice sweet and salty taste. I sampled the General's chicken and thought it had the perfect amount of sweet vs. spicy; however the bf thought the chicken wasn't crunchy enough. Overall, the food was pretty good and, since it's close to where we live, we'll probably go back. Nothing fancy, but worth a shot if you live in the area and are looking for decent Chinese food.\n\nIMPORTANT SIDE NOTE: They do NOT deliver! Carry-out or Eat-in only!!! We asked for delivery on the phone and were told they do not deliver and promptly hung up on.
2 ||| I think I went there at the wrong time.  They didn't take our order until 15 minutes later when we asked for it, the lady who served us seemed so nervous and careless.  She didn't know where to sit us, she dropped a cup of water and put the rolling trash can right in front on my face.  She might be a hostess and forced to wait because they seemed very busy even though there were not that many people in the restaurant.  Side orders were good but the bulgogi and galbi were not that great.  Price is good though, cheap.
1 ||| Two issues: The El Machino tortilla station was devoid of people and the salsa was way spicier than I recall in any CA Chevy's. It was so spicy that this white boy was sweating through the cheap paper napkins (5) that this place provides. Another free birthday meal and chicken fajitas were the choice. Chicken was sliced too thin,  but had no trace of the promised spices and chilies. It was just grilled chicken with plenty of onions and peppers and the usual condiments. Still, a solid safe choice for a chain, but not sure why every waiter in the bar was gay. Nothing wrong with that, but both my waiter and my chip and salsa guy were on the other team and that was a bit unusual. Also, I know it's a Mexican chain, but we are in America and nobody really needs to listen to full-on Mexican tunes during dinner. IF i want the full experience, I will just go the east side of Vegas and find some taco joint with bars on the windows.
0 ||| Found small leak in tire (nail) and wanted to get fixed on wife's car. Pull in at 10:20 and am told it will be 40-45 minutes. After an hour car has not moved and no update from horrible front staff. Went to counter and they said it was next to be in.after another hour it was done. I'm guessing they forgot about it till I started asking what's going on. Horrible service for what could have been a 10-20 min job. Will NEVER go back here. Waste of a day because of a nail in tire.\n\nUPDATE! \nDay after the above review was done took car out on freeway to find the tire they fixed was out of balance now. They did not put the tire back on the rim at the same location or balance the tire. Had to stop at another place and get tire balanced. Wow, total failure on the most basic stuff.
1 ||| I'm with others here - not a lover of Primanti Bros.  Sandwiches are fine (I have ordered the turkey and cheese) but the service is horrible.  Rude, arrogant, and just nasty.  Plus when is the last time a broom has been taken to the floors?  (I'm reviewing the Monroeville one here).
0 ||| I have eaten at this restaurant a few times before and liked it. A nice neighborhood place. So, we thought to go here to celebrate my niece's graduation. We had a party of 10 and the service was terrible.  The servers didn't bring drinks or ask if we wanted anything other than our order. They were all in a back room doing something. And the food was not good, either. I had chicken piccata - yuck. It had a thickish cream sauce - like creamy soup. Not light and lemony like it should be. I do not think I would go back.
3 ||| Was in the area and hit this place for lunch today. Every thing was very good, especially the nan which was brought to my table fresh and hot.  I have eaten here many times before but not lately. Some days they have stuff I like better than other days but it is always pretty good.
0 ||| The service was not good. We had to search out our own soy sauce (the one on our table was empty). Our drinks were left empty for most of the meal. This was despite the fact that we were there on a Saturday afternoon and there were very few other patrons there.\n\nWe ordered two rolls, an appetizer and a bowl of steamed rice for the baby to snack on. The food was just ok. I would have liked more wasabi, but I never had a chance to ask because our server just didn't come around.\n\nI had not been to Ra in years and I would say that the quality has declined. I don't plan on returning.
3 ||| We received some mini bundt cakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes as a gift. The small size made them very cute, and the cake was moist, rich, and indulgent.
4 ||| The best - period. Everything is charcoal broiled and the selection is ample, including jumbo beef dogs, bratwurst, \"white hots\", foot longs, etc.  Excellent fries, loganberry shakes. There are often long lines around lunch, but they move quickly. Ted's originated in Buffalo and is a legend there, along with wings (invented at the Anchor Bar) and Schwabl's.
2 ||| Ok, ok, ok, y'all need to calm down.  Quit with the 'it's too small,' 'it's a Pittsburgh thing,' and 'it's so greasy' statements.  That's what Primanti's IS.  It's a compact, greasy Pittsburgh right.  \n\nYes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted Primanti's and no more Market Square location?  I know I would.  If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite of that Pittsburgh goodness.  \n\nThe 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  I mean that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.\n\nAnd 'it's so greasy?'  Did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.  \n\nBetter yet, move out of my way, I'm about to chow down on that Pittsburgh grease fest awaiting my attention.
0 ||| How do you have a bad experience at a Nordy's? I thought that this was impossible. Let me preface this by saying that it wasn't really the Nordy's that bothered me so much but the MAC counter at Nordy's. \n\nI'll just sum it up in three sentences:\n\nOne....Absolutely could not keep their scheduling on point and caused my friend and I to be late to a wedding. Two....Rude and oblivious associates that would rather have you wait because they couldn't possibly take more than two appointments an hour even though they had a total of count them with me....eight people just standing around doing NOTHING. Three....Its quite apparent they have no appreciation or respect for their customers as I saw them make snide faces at their customers and rudely gossip about customers once they left. \n\nAwful and Absurd. Get a new set of associates for this location. \n\nI'm SOOO glad this is NOT my Nordy's. I'll never come to this location ever again.
3 ||| Addictive like water.\n\nMeat flavored water nothing could be more exciting! Top it with pink meat and make the experience ride down your palate a hot, steamy affair.  Generously portioned & the perfect solution to end world hunger! A complete meal of  breakfast, lunch & dinner in a soup bowl with a hint warmth & tlc.\n\nEnergizer bunny prompt service. SIT - SERVE - EAT in under two minutes (don't take my word for this I may have just gotten lucky)\n\nWhile lemongrass has recently suffered a stint of poor service, its satisfying to find the better alternative during a rare chilly night.
4 ||| My husband come here every week.... the staff is friendly and always on point. Miranda and the other bartender girl are amazing. I would suggest you give them a try. I'm so in love with the 9oz  steak...
4 ||| Almost become my first choice of shopping as it have a lots of Asian food. I really enjoy the complex cultures and the variety but it's really hard to look for a specific items cause sometimes they don't carry it anymore. But I still gonna come by here everytime I do my monthly shopping cause this place is near my house. Stat!
0 ||| I bought a high dollar mountain bike at this shop over a year ago, assured that, although I was paying a premium price, I was getting \"the best\".  The build took longer than promised, and I had to return several times for mechanical adjustments.  Each time I returned, the staff was so indifferent, they would feign not recognizing me - weird.  For a customer who spent thousands.  \n\nNot that I would want to be accused of using this review to advertise another shop, but it's important, so follow along.  I found another shop, Airpark Bikes.  They are a high end shop that sells many of the same brands as the slippery pigs.  The point is, that when I went there, they started from scratch.  It turns out that the bike I purchased originally was the wrong size frame for me.  All of my attempts to move the seat further back and the handlebars forward were simply because my frame was too small for me.  The new shop used several instruments to determine my right size.  The pigs never even used a tape measure on me.  And \"the best\" components I paid dearly for - Truativ noir and Shimano XT - I learned that these components were mediocre at best.\n\nIn the end, I bought an entire new bike at Airpark.  My size, with all XX and carbon components - truly \"the best\" - and the irony is that I paid the same amount for first bike I bought from the pigs.\n\nI had a very expensive and painful lesson in buying mountain bikes.  Don't go to the slippery pigs, or you too will pay more and get less.
4 ||| Stopped by this Sunday morning at around 11AM.  There was a decent crowd but they seated the 5 of us in about 5 minutes.  Service was average - he got the job done.  But the food was good, and I am happy to announce that their servings are big enough for a brunch (it's a pet peeve of mine when places serve minute portions).  Two of us got the Euro Crepe Breakfast, which was a little on the smaller side but pretty damn good.  The Country Fried Steak was a Country Fried Steak, nothing out of the ordinary but came in a pretty decent sized serving, and extremely filling, so perfect if you're hungry.  I got the November special - Bandito Omelet.  It was delicious, and packed with flavors.  I highly suggest you switch out the toast for pancakes (which is what I did), and you will be stuffed.  Or have leftovers. Whatever works for you.  Definitely a must-try if you haven't stopped by yet - I'll definitely be back.
0 ||| After moving here from Los Angeles, I have to say that I was really expecting more from the Whole Foods in Madison, especially in the produce department.  I have been nothing but disappointed with this Whole Foods, but I guess that's why this one is so much cheaper than any other one I've ever been to.  The store is the same size as the one I used to shop at, however, the layout is so terrible that you can hardly push a cart through.  And when it comes to vegan/vegetarian food, there is literally one tiny little cold case.  That's it.  I have been to WF in Los Angeles, Burbank, Sherman Oaks, Chicago, Fairfax, and even in hillbilly Columbia, SC and every single one has at least three cold aisles of vegetarian and vegan foods.  Then, every time I go in, the selection is smaller and smaller, and when I ask about products that have been carried there for months that suddenly disappear, I get looked at like I'm crazy, as if those products never existed in the first place.  Their basics are awful, the deli and food bars are gross and loaded with unnecessary fillers that are usually contradictory to Whole Foods in general, but I suppose when you're the only one in a very large area, you can get away with most anything.  I find more vegan options at Woodmans, suprisingly enough.  Definitely not impressed.
2 ||| Can't have a party without a tray of baby banditos. Everything thing else I've tried was just ok. Tonight they were a little extra greasy with my tacos.
2 ||| Long time planned girls weekend with last minute spa services found at Spa Lamar. Jeanie at the front desk helped book us and was nothing short of flawless in in interactions, grace and insights. We only walked a couple blocks to get there and loved the ambiance and joy that exudes from the staff and surroundings. It wasn't the fanciest place but it had all the ammenities and really hit the key things just right. I was mischarged for my service which I just realized as I reviewed my weekend spend and will call to request an adjustment which should go smooth as I'm sure it was just an oversight. Go and enjoy yourself! I will go back and will have more services done.
4 ||| The pizza was hand tossed but the crust was perfectly crispy! The flavors were perfect too. I had the small which fed me (Im a big guy) but could have fed 2 people. I also had a 6 piece of hot wings which were very good! I would deffinately go back here again.
2 ||| Starbucks - meh.  I've definitely had better. I prefer local, unique coffee shops instead of the chains any day of the week. However, I recently drove from Raleigh to Charlotte and had to have *something* before meetings...I couldn't wait until I got back to my hotel for room service. So this worked in a pinch. Not something I'd regularly do.
2 ||| I have never eaten inside this place and I probably never will... but call ahead and order your food and make sure they make it fresh... you will not be disappointed. \n\nBest deal in town or anywhere I've actual ever ordered from for shumai (large pork/shrimp balls wrapped and steamed commonly seen served at dim sum dining. The owner makes them himself fresh, and order from them... they sell 62 pieces for $30. thats a deal! We tend to order from here whenever we have to go to potlucks or we need to cater an event. \n\nTheir cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don't just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it's the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain't stingy with servings here. \n\nThey have awesome fried cream cheese wontons... and they're cheap!!! 12pieces for $6.95 you can't beat that price, coz you order from Rice N Noodle (not to bash on them) but you get 4 pieces for $5 something I think... just saying. \n\nHonestly I would give this place a 1 or 2 star just based on the place and display of the place... but they really are a \"Rice To-Go\" establishment... order your shit TO-GO or by the trays so your food is bomb bomb and fresh!! and you'll save money than ordering anywhere else. So rightfully I have to give 3 stars for awesome affordable cheap pricing, good food when you order, and for the best LARGE shumai in town!
4 ||| LOVE this trader joes! Not only is it clean, stocked up, and filled with nice employees, this place just makes it enjoyable to walk in and shop! I never have had a bad experience here. I love how everything is just neat and well kept. The way that this place makes sure you are happy with your products. Love the variety of foods they have in stock. LOVE LOVE LOVE This trader joes!
4 ||| I've tried many different salons throughout the city since moving here 6 years ago, and once I found Tim at Denham & Co, I haven't gone anywhere else! My hair is crazy thick and I always have troubles coloring it but Tim always gets the perfect shade and cuts it in the best way. I get so many compliments on the color anywhere I go. The price is definitely worth it, plus you'll have a great time while you're there - staff is super friendly and talkative. If you're looking for stylish look, need help with color, suggestions for a overall new look - go here! 2 of my best friends already have gone here after I did.
0 ||| NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it, I don't know why we didn't leave... maybe because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get a table (this was during the summer). We ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something I would recommend. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating)... thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40. Yes, I remember exactly how much I spent even though it was months ago because I kept thinking how I could have spent that money in a better place! I could have got a mani & pedi... had some great sushi... the list goes on. lol
1 ||| This location is on the second floor of the Galleria Mall.  \n\nI've been to many locations of Victorias Secret and this one didn't measure up to the others.  Several different styles I was shopping for were out of stock.  It's kind of frustrating when I would find a style I liked but they were out of my size.   \n\nService here wasn't any better.   The girl who initially was helping me didn't show me all of the sale items but led me directly to the most expensive items in the store.  I had to find those on my own.  The gentlemen cashier was also unpleasant.  He asked who helped me on the sales floor.  I couldn't remember her name as she really didn't help anyway.  He proceeded to ask several times more.  If I can't tell you the first time, then the next three times aren't going to be any different.  \n\nIt wasn't a great experience and would recommend a different location.
1 ||| I was excited to come here on a semi-recent trip to Pittsburgh visiting sister and brother-in-law. I'm sorry to say, I was let down.\n\nWe came for brunch. We each opted for the pasta trio. Sounded like a good deal, so why not?\n\nThe sangria was good. The little buffet of sorts was a total let down. Bread and flavored butters on the table were pretty good.\n\nAs for the pasta...\nMore landed on my fianc\u00e9 and sisters clothes than did land on their plates. 2/3 were complete duds. The pesto was pretty good. \n\nService was okay at best. Nothing was done about the spillage, so I wonder if this a regular occurrence. If so, find better servers because if you don't, you'll be losing a lot of business.\n\nI'd consider coming for dinner, maybe, next time I'm in town.
1 ||| Its this one Sunday where i over slept and wake up feeling i have lost the whole day.... Had a quick bite and drove around and stumble upon Ahwatukee CC. As i remember one of my colleague told me a must play course. So without checking the web, i went in pay for twilight and start my round. Overall is a public/municipal course and its old and abused without much care. Flat and pretty much surrounded my houses. If i had to force it i would say its the longer PAR 3 where there is water hazard on the left that i could remember (maybe). That day the pin was tug left and i usually draw my shot so its a little intimidating to attack, plus the sun setting in the horizon is right in the middle of my face when teeing off. Very cheap but i won't go back unless i am given a free round with my buddy while i don't have other priority.
0 ||| This is a place to stay away from.  Because they have been in business so long they think they can do what they want to the customers.  Despite the staff recommending a shoe as a good tap shoe, and despite the owner putting taps on the shoe, when it didn't work for the dancer as a tap shoe, the owner not only refused to stand behind the sale of the shoe and his workmanship, but he was rude about not making things right.  In a day in age when online shopping is quick and convenient, retail stores should be bending over backwards to be helpful to their customers.  Barry is not.  Stay away from Dee's Dancewear.  Poor Dee would be sick to see her sons doing such a lousy job with her namesake.  Shame on them!
2 ||| No this place is not aesthetically pleasing, but the food is tasty, pretty cheap and the service is friendly. The lamb souvlaki is good but the lamb seems to be more gristly than others I've had. The rolls are amazing! I gave it 3 stars because there is better Greek food out there, but this quite good for how cheap it is.
1 ||| So good they don't need your business. They must be. I'm afraid I couldn't tell you. I looked them up Sunday evening and called to see when they closed. After being told 9pm, my girlfriend and I drove 8 miles just to walk in and be told they were closed. It was 7:45! Sorry, but that bears repeating. It was 7:45! The open sign was still on and the sign on the door clearly stated that they close at 10pm el Domingo. So unless Domingo has come to mean something other than Sunday since I studied Spanish, their open sign lacks an off switch or the restaurant exists in some Einsteinian time warp, they turned down paying customers hours before closing time. I'll leave it to you to decide which is more likely. I for one, will take my money somewhere it's actually appreciated.
3 ||| The food is very good. The building is old
1 ||| This was my third choice after Lotus had an hour wait and Chada is closed for the week. \n\nI ordered the vegetable panang curry and chicken mint noodles. I asked the waitress how much it would be to substitute the brown rice for the white rice that comes with the panang curry and she said it was the same price as the side order. This made no sense so I asked the \"manager\" about the policy and all she said was yes brown rice 3 dollars. If you are a manager of a establishment where your customers are primarily American you need to know how to communicate in English. After having my first bite of the panang curry I could tell Pin Kaow serves Americanized Thai food. I should have known when I walked in and did not see once person of Asian decent. Back to the panang curry; it tasted like I was having straight up butter with minimal spice on top of my rice. The mint noodles tasted good but also overly sweet to appeal to the American customer. The noodles sat on a bed of wilted romaine lettuce which made the dish unappealing. The only plus is that they serve brown rice but I will not be back because the manager cannot explain the policies and the food is one dimensional and completely Americanized.
3 ||| Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\n\nNOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.
4 ||| We ordered take-out from here. I always have great things to say about their customer service. They are the nicest, most accommodating people, but I don't have such great things to say about their food. Here are the things I've had from there in the past month and how I feel:\n\nChicken Parm - Don't do it. You're better off making it at home. The sauce is bland and the chicken is dry.\n\nMargherita Pizza - It's doesn't taste bad! It definitely doesn't taste like a margherita pizza though. \n\nWings - Their honey hot sauce is a favorite among my friends. I enjoy their suicide sauce. It's called \"suicide\" sauce for a reason, so if you're not a spicy food eater, don't do it. Order boneless because their bone-in wings are soggy.\n\nGarlic cheese bread - Again, you can literally through cheese and garlic on toast and make this at home. \n\nOverall, their pizza does its job! I guess I don't really discriminate when it comes to pizzas. All sizes, toppings and types work for me.
4 ||| Yelpers, once again you all came through!  Being fairly new to the city, the only real breakfast place I have found is Pamela's.  After reading Yelp this morning my friend and I went to Dor-Stop.  You guys rocked!  We had to wait 20 minutes but walked around the neighborhood (really should do a huge workout before AND after eating here!) then it was time for us to be seated.  The waitress was excellent!  They were packed so it took about 30 minutes to get our food but she kept our glasses of iced tea filled the whole time (and brought out a new glass of ice for each of us to refill).  I ordered the pancakes while my friend ordered a vegetarian omelet.  We ordered one order of potato pancakes to share.  \n\nBoth us really enjoyed our meals a lot!  Thanks again Yelpers, now I have a new favorite breakfast place!
4 ||| The food here is decent. It's a big place with great service that gives you the Italian family-style atmosphere you would desire. However, the food is not very good. The only awesome thing is that they have two different choices of gluten free pasta, which is awesome if you can't have gluten!
4 ||| This is our go-to for take out mexican food.\nGreat prices and really good food.\nI order my son the baby plate for less than $2 and he gets a heap of rice and beans and some shredded chicken.\nI love the chicken taco with a ton of salsa.\nHubby is a green chili kind of guy and always gets a green chili burro.\nFresh chips are an added bonus even though you do have to pay extra for them.\nThe refried beans do have lard so we always order the whole beans and they are excellent.
2 ||| will be trying ths place again next  week.  look for coupons and then the prce is more than reasonable.  i have a coupon for $29.99 for 2 adults and 2 children (under 12).....that's a deal.  i'm glad someone reviewed the rest rooms.. ugh.   sam s. complained about too many slow elderly people, she should hope she reaches that stage in life.  nasty person!  next time she goes to a restaurant   call ahead to find out what the age group is that day.
4 ||| Nothing beats a bean and cheese with both red and green salsa.
4 ||| I have been a client at Studio Fx for years.  Liz does an outstanding job with weaves/cuts and Krista is amazing with shampooing and styling your hair.  I always get complimented on my hair.
1 ||| Food is good.. but SOME of staff is very very rude. When I ordered from this location the girl on the phone very rudely stated \"You know there's a location closer to your address.\" not kindly very rudely. Yea I do but the menus at each location are different. She basically said I don't want your money. Then the pizza got delivered to my OLD address she didn't even ask what address was correct just quickly hung up the phone. When I called to tell the girl its been a while since the food was ordered I figured out it was the old address and of course she was ticked off and even more rude. Thanks but no thanks wont be ordering here again. MAMA DE PALMAS is the place to go food  is better and staff cared about my business.
0 ||| I'm here for the week on business. Upon arrival I was happy with the hotel. Around 1am I was woken up by the room next to me that had an \"incident\". There was a crying infant and fighting adults who were screaming and banging on the door. I had to call the front desk to call security TWO times before anything happened. This went on for at least an hour. I'm livid about the sleep I lost and discomfort I had to experience. I didn't feel safe to even leave my room. The door was eventually broken into I'm assuming I will attach an image in another post. When I spoke to the manager this morning she offered me a free breakfast and WiFi... really? That's not customer service. I will not be staying here again and I will make sure no one from my company stays here in the future.
4 ||| Great place for casual Mexican fare.  Very flavorful and colorful.  The Chile Relleno was very different and totally enjoyable.  Friendly atmosphere and quick service.\nI have been back a few times to try other items on the menu and I have never been disappointed.
1 ||| I went here last night with a couple of friends befor watchin' the black and gold complete the almost annual boring task of wooping' on some brownie as* in Cleveland.  We were seated upstairs at a great table upstairs facing ellseworth.  The view was great watching many of my fellow burghers' imbibe on a windy Sunday afternoon.  The positive experience ended here.  Well, maybe except for the humorous menu that made me smile.  The waitress was so below average, you know the type... she is doing you a favor by taking your order.  I had the pierogies appetizer which was flavorless potato filling served in a overcooked pasta shell served in vegetable oil with maybe one or two slices of onions.  Come on!  This is Pittsburgh. You should be ashamed.  Then another server brought my burger and I made the unforgivable mistake of asking her to grab me another beer.  Sorry, I know you are not the one who took my order, but you are bringing my food.  I've made this mistake before and usually the person says \"okay, I'll let your server know\", not \"Ummmm, I'm not serving you,, you'll have to talk to your server\".  Funny, I thought you might run into each other in the back.  Anyways, the burger was close to inedible burnt to a crisp resembled a hockey puck.  We also tried the hummus which was pretty good.  I ordered a kettle one with cranberry and was brought absolut.  Friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad.  They both said they were pretty good, if not a little dry.  Then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our bill.  If they executed the food well and had at least average service I'd be back, however they don't and I won't.
4 ||| I really like Dr Wysong- his nurse practitioner could use a little help on her bedside manner. But- they were able to get my son in quickly as a new patient, and the Doc was thorough, friendly and informative. So, I will be switching my family over.
3 ||| This is a Pittsburgh/Shadyside institution.\n\nWhat can I say, this place is good-eatin' basic Italian food!  Not spectacular, but when you want a good nuthin-fancy dinner, this is the place to go.  The pizza is outstanding.
0 ||| I stood waiting behind another customer and watched a roach climb along the pass through that connects the kitchen to the ordering area.\n\nNo thanks. You can cancel my order.\n\n2013 #181 / 365
3 ||| the four stars are for their hummus, olive bar, and AMAZING peanut butter covered pretzels. i still prefer fresh and easy or whole foods..
4 ||| I've been to Zen 32 several times. It's not great, but it's consistently \"pretty decent.\"  I reserve 4 stars for really good food, and 5 stars for absolutely top notch food. Zen 32 doesn't have the goods to be that high. I don't throw my stars loosely unlike others who have reviewed Zen 32. \n\nPerhaps people give Zen 32 4 or 5 stars because they haven't been to LA, NYC, San Francisco, Chicago, or Miami. I can name about 20 restaurants that have better sushi than Zen 32. Perhaps some people compare Zen 32 to Todai or all you can eat sushi. If you do that, I can see how you can give it 5 stars. Those are the only logical reasons I can possibly assume why people gave this place 4 or 5 stars. \n\nMost of the people giving Zen 32 4 or 5 stars haven't experienced good sushi. Then again, we're in the desert, and good sushi is hard to come by. So, just quick advice for all you reviewers, some of you people need to venture out before annointing Zen as great sushi.
4 ||| This place was awesome!  The ambiance is sooo pretty (I am obsessed with the huge, lighted Eiffel Tower in the center of the room...just trying to figure out how to sneak out with it), and service was excellent.  I came with 5 other gabby girlfriends for dinner at 7:30, and we chatted our way through apps, dinner, drinks, and beyond.  When the bills came, all were separated individually for us, and the server made sure to let us know that gratuity was already included.  Even with the disclaimer,  several girls tipped more than the allotted amount, and the manager came back to the table with the bills to verify a SECOND time that we knew gratuity was already included (I was WAY impressed with this).  What stellar service!  After the bills had been paid, we continued to chat for almost an hour before realizing that they had probably closed at least 30 minutes prior, and we were the last table in the restaurant.  No one said a word, or made us feel as though we needed to leave (which we did immediatly when we realized our faux pas), and in fact gave us a friendly farewell when we left.  I will say the place is pretty spendy (try about $28-$55 for an entree, and all ala carte), but worth it for special occasions, especially when the service is so great.  The menu was interesting and enticing, and everything I tried was delicious (INCLUDING the Mac N Cheese!!)  I will definitely be saving up some money to come back soon!
4 ||| Harp & Fiddle is the gem in Pittsburgh's strip district.  They have several beers on tap, great food, and a nice, relaxed atmosphere.  The staff is especially pleasant and very friendly.  H&F is an excellent place for the end of the work week.  They have nightly specials during happy hour Which lasts from 5pm to 7pm. H&F also has live bands playing nightly.  The acts range from up tempo rock music to laid back acoustic guitar acts.  Overall, H&F has something for everyone and is an awesome place to go for good beer and good times with the people you love to be around.
3 ||| this is a good old rowdy, party, have a good time bar. it's not fancy. it's geared to a very laid back crowd, alot of bikers and alot of people who like hard rock n roll. they crowd may look a little tough, but it's really a good mix of people. don't dress up here. you will stick out like a soar thumb. there is a full menu and the food is on the cheaper side. happy hour is 10-7! they have 35 cent wings all day long, i think everyday. not sure about the every day thing. there is a live band on fridays and probably saturdays and it's hard rock. there's a dance floor. it does get really busy and is generally alot of fun. it's dark due to lack of windows. there's alot of places to sit. a good all around time. not for kids at anytime.
3 ||| I've ate at both locations, the food is usually good, some times they are bit off and the chicken seems tough. Red Velvet cake is great, sweet tea is just like down south, and the waffles are delicious!\n\nBoth locations are always crowded so get there early and come hungry!
4 ||| Until recently I would have given this place five stars. However, the last few times I've gone there they didn't have what I needed and what I ended up with wasn't that good. My last experience I needed a chocolate cake with whipped topping. Even though I ordered if four days in advance, they said they couldn't do the whipped topping. I had to have a pre-made chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. Bummer. I should have made the cake myself. It would have been better and not cost me $30.
0 ||| Please do not take your pets here. I took my puppy in because she was losing hair in spots. She was diagnosed with having ringworm so they gave me the normal stuff you give a puppy to get rid of ringworm, charged me a few hundred bucks and had me make a follow-up. I took her back a few more times because the problem wasn't going away in which they gave me more medication and charged me more money. The last visit, I was very upset and asked them if they had misdiagnose my puppy and that it reminded me of mange but they said she had ringworm. I let them know I was upset that it was costing me all this money and my puppy was getting worse. Long story short I took her to the doggie dermatologist and found out she did not have ringworm at all but dermodex. The ringworm came back negative. I was also told that dermodex is one of the first things they should have looked for because it is common in puppies so this was a complete miss on their part. The dermodex was diagnosed in less than 10 minutes at the derm office and the vet showed me under the microscope what they looked like. This experience has cost me about $1000.00 in vet bills when it should have cost me about half of that. I will never take my puppy back to Banfield again and I advise you to go someplace else.
4 ||| This was my first time at this location, which happens to be the original Macayo's, and I couldn't help, but be reminded of the Robert Frost poem, The Road Not Taken...\n\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood (because the hostess was MIA)\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\n... okay, sorry, so after entering and walking down the dimly light hallway you have the option to veer left or right. Right brings you into the bar area and left, to the dining area. In the middle is the hostess desk, (who probably took the road less traveled by) so I meandered into the dining room where I was I greeted by a friendly female waitress who helped me find my way to a table and later brought the menus.\n\nI was waiting for the other two members of the party and since it was 11:30 am and I'm inbetween classes, I figured the White Cranberry Margarita sounded reasonable (its five o'clock somewhere!). It was a little bit salty, a little bit sweet, but all so sensual  that I had to remind myself that there was alcohol in it so I could pace myself. The chips and salsa were fantastic (but really, how can anyone mess that up) to nosh on while the other party members arrived. The lunch specials here are pretty amazing and it does get crowded fast. I went for the lunch Mex and Match 1 item with 1 side for $6.99. I got a bean tostada with veggies. The veggies were a pleasant surprise, they were steamed but not doused in butter that most places seem to love to do. I just wish they would have thrown a little bit more on the plate. There were two pieces of broccoli, a few tiny pieces of carrots, and zucchini, but I get it...I'm at a Mexican joint. Everyone else loved their dishes and the service was quick, but attentive. I would definitely come back.
4 ||| For a quick, delicious, cheap (did I say delicious) chicken lunch or dinner in town, look no further than the Roasting Company. Not much decor to speak of, but when all meals come out in under 5 minutes and cost less than $10, fancy decorations are unnecessary. \n\nMy two favorite meals are the chicken and black bean con queso and the half white meat chicken breast. Both are cooked to perfection, and I can get at least two meals out of one order. The corn bread muffins are also very good (be sure to order additional because you'll want more than one - it's worth it at only $0.35 each), and if you go on Saturday, you can get the mac 'n cheese, which has a kick and is my favorite side item offered. The squash casserole and the sweet potatoes are also quite good. \n\nUltimately, I recommend the Roasting Company for a quick meal or takeout on those days where you just don't want to cook or need a quick lunch.
4 ||| This place is so cool!  I wasn't expecting there to be much of any art scene in Charlotte and then I come across the Charlotte Art League on a gallery tour and am newly inspired!  It's such a great concept where local artists can come and rent out space to display their work or practice their craft.  Each of the booths have their own little spin and it was really cool to even see some of the artists on site while they were painting, drawing, sculpting or whatever it is that they love.  It's a great place to go to just stroll around and get lost for a bit.\n\nWe came on a Friday night where they were celebrating Mardi Gras with free appetizers and the employees giving out Mardi Gras beads for fun.  I definitely enjoyed going there and would love to come back when we have guests from out of town to show them around.
1 ||| Trying a new breakfast spot we traveled over to Brunchies in downtown Chandler. The menu was full of basic breakfast staples and a surprisingly amount of Mexican dishes (actually not too surprisingly after I learned Brunchies is owned by Serrano's, next door). \n\nOk, normally I wouldn't write about this but I cant let it slide. The water was bad. Not just bad AWFUL! Some of the worst water I have ever tasted in my life, and believe me I've had some water that a dog would shy away from. The water was so bad it even tainted the coffee. Trying to look past the mauvaise eau, I decided to let the food do the talking. I was in a particularly healthy mood so I opted for the Southern Biscuits which were two biscuits topped with eggs and southern gravy. The biscuits were not to bad, a little crumbly, the eggs were fine, and the gravy was fine too, although definitely made from a mix. Overall my entire meal was...fine. Kind of a one note tune. Not good, not bad, just fine.  Another person in my group ordered an omelet, I cant remember which one but he agreed that it was just fine as well. The service was great and the food came quickly which was nice. If I was to go back I would definitely try one of the many Mexican inspired dishes. Unfortunately thanks to so-so food and the water situation (yes is was that bad) I doubt I will ever be going back.
0 ||| Took about 30 minutes for us to finally order and it took practically another 45-hour for the food which only took us 15-20 minutes to eat. Got our food before our utensils. Long story short: horrendous service.
4 ||| I stayed nearby on a business trip and was in the mood for Thai, so I called in an order for pick-up.  I ordered the Galee Gai (chicken and potatoes in yellow curry over rice) and spring rolls on the side.  Both were fantastic!  The curry is definitely spicy, but it's the good spicy you're probably looking for if you want Thai.  The spring rolls were crispy and delicious and came with a sweet-spicy dipping sauce.  The portions were great - neither too small, nor a ton of wasted leftovers.\n\nWhen I walked in to pick up the order, I was pleasantly surprised: black tables and chairs, nice table settings (complete with linen napkins and wine glasses), a very nice bar setting (great for eating alone), and plently of booths, \"typical\" tables, and high-top tables.  The kitchen is behind the bar, and you can pretty much see everything going on back there, so there's no question about cleanliness or sketchy food preparation.  I also saw one of the cooks plating some food, and it was one heck of a presentation!\n\nI'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town!
2 ||| Wait 20 mins for an elliptical. The weights are limited and they don't have a lot of machines. Oversold memberships. I just closed my over priced membership and joined fitness connection where everything is new and only 10 bucks a month. The Y is overrated.
0 ||| Driving by this place, week after week and hearing so many positive things about this place, my wife and I rolled into Big Dogs with pretty high hopes.  It just seems like the kind of place that you can roll up your sleeves and dig into some great food, maybe throw $20 into a video poker machine and relax with some friends over a few pints.\n\nHowever, the bar staff was ridiculously rude and greedy.  There was one bartender for forty or so guests around a massive bar.  Every time a manager was called to the bar to answer some complaint about service or food or both, they would ask her if she needed help.  She would look around the bar and say \"nah its not so bad\" and then continue to give terrible service.\n\nI ordered some type of brat-burger sandwich creation that I thought was going to save the experience, but it turned out to be a hotdog pretending to be a brat.  At least they did have a fresh pretzel roll to hide the hotdog.  This place seems like it could be awesome or has been awesome, but I just missed it completely.  The twice fried or twice dipped wings were incredible, by the way!
4 ||| Very close to capitol square, with a good German restaurant, the Essenhaus, next door plus a little coffee shop. Very intimate little hotel gives you a quiet hideaway from the madness of state street and capitol but close enough you can enter the fray quickly when needed.
0 ||| I need to say up front that this comment is about WS online shopping experience, not about this particular store. I've been shopping at WS both in West Towne Mall and online for many times, but a simple cake stand has totally ruined my trust with them. \n\nI ordered a domed cake stand in mid November, and after waiting for almost 2 weeks a single dome arrived at my place -- no cake stand, just the dome. I called customer service and they said they'll ship the stand to me within several days. About a week later, another box arrived and when I opened it -- it was another dome!! Where is my cake stand??? I called again and they say that the cake stand is out of stock. OK but why didn't you say so at first place? Why did you still put this item online saying it's in stock? So I selected a different cake stand, which is pricier and I had to pay MUCH MORE for this one, but they don't seem to have those good valued ones any more. It was scheduled for delivery on Christmas Eve, but not surprisingly, it never did. In fact, when we called today yet again, they say that it'll not be in stock until March, which now we'll be a giant fool to actually believe. I decided to give them one last shot and change my order to yet another cake stand, and if they fail to deliver it again, I will change my comment to one star and never shop on WS online store again.\n\nCan't believe such a company should have such lousy warehouse management. I'm soooooooooooo very disappointed by you, Williams Sonoma!!
1 ||| Thank GOD they opened a Lowe's by me.  I doubt you'll ever find me in a HD again.  \n\nI have never felt so dumb as when I was forced into Home Depot the other day.  Just because I look like I have no busines being in a hardware store, doesnt mean that I have no business being in a hardware store.  I have money to spend dammit!!  Cut me some freaking slack.  \n\nI had to search high and low for a \"friendly sales representative\" who was stick-up-their-ass crabby at best, and watch them look at me like a moron when I asked what aisle a laser level would be in.  I'm no Tim-the-Toolman-Taylor but I think thats a pretty common item.  QUIT LOOKING AT ME LIKE I SHOULD BE AT A BAR SOMEWHERE AND SHOW ME THE LEVEL AISLE.\n\nI also needed help carrying a huge ceiling fan out of the store.  This is not unreasonable but the clerk and helper-guy looked completely put out.  You work at HOME DEPOT you jerks, lend an effing hand.  \n\nThe only reason this crap shoot gets 2 stars is because its always pretty clean, its has a boat load of stuff if you know where to look, and the worker's uniforms are all a lovely matching orange.  Thats it.
1 ||| i have been there three times and never again. first two times the wait for spicy strips was more than five minutes. last  i got a food borne illness from the strips. i know it was the strips because i only eat once a day and that was it.
2 ||| You know what you're going to get when you go to a Starbucks. This is a clean location, with a drive thru window, and speedy service. To get to the drive thru you do have to drive around to the back of the building. For the most part I try to avoid Starbucks for local independent coffee shops. In a pinch though you know what they have and can get your caffeine fix.
4 ||| I had to bump this up to a 5 star rating after trying the delicious Shahi Paneer!
0 ||| Worst customer service ever.  You first have to dig thru the rack after rack of poorly organized clothes to find a hidden gem.  That part can be fun - but then you have to wait in line forever trying to cash out.  The cashiers are slow, unhelpful, and always on break.  Management never responds to line demand.  You could grow a vegetable garden with the time you waste waiting in line.\n\nGo early or don't go.
4 ||| Starbucks is Starbucks. Can't say I can review the coffee because it is pretty much the same across the company. If you like coffee at one Starbucks, you'll like it at this one too. Staff was friendly enough and got my coffee (vanilla latte) out quick. I prefer local coffee spots if I can find them, which get my four and five star ratings.
0 ||| Didn't realize how terrible this place was until I went somewhere else. Reason I went somewhere else is because they told me that I couldn't do my wellness check and std screening together- when I always have in the past. They wanted me to schedule two separate visits where I would have to pay two separate co pays.... I went to a new doctor and not only did she do it all in one visit she also gave me my birth control on the spot with no charge and without going to the pharmacy, and I also found out that the Estrella clinic had given me false information. This place treats you like a cattle not a person. I would never recommend this place
0 ||| I went to Ross to get curtains and rods. The pricing was great. Saved me a lot of money. I'd check at Ross before Anna's Linens. \n\nDownside: You can't take the cart out of the store which makes it a bit difficult to buy several big items. The cashier was a bit confused on how to package my 6 big curtain rods. I mentioned about them helping me out in which they were non-responsive. How did I get my items out? 3 trips out to the car which wasn't a big deal. Also the loss prevention guy kept staring at me which was awkward.
0 ||| This management company is just okay.  When we originally went to look at the property, the key did not work, so they had to get a locksmith to fix that problem.  The house is definitely out of the way from their location, but luckily our realtor was able to get the new keys for us to come back another day to check it out.\n\nI like that they took no time to approve us when we applied.  \n\nWe have been at our property for over a year now.  The lease specifically states that it will end and turn into a month to month term - fantastic, I love that idea and that's how it was at my last rental.  However, Talley does not stick to their own lease agreement, but instead sent us a new lease to sign for a year with a higher rate.  You could do month to month, but that would be an even higher rate.  Hopefully next time Talley will renew it as they are supposed to, but I am not expecting them to if they did not the first time around.\n\nIt is also an annoyance that they increased our rent when we have paid ontime every month and we have only called them once about an issue.  They need to realize the rates around the area are not worth the increase as well, we are paying more than other rentals in the neighborhood.  If they increase it for the next term and do not go by the lease terms, we will be moving out.  It will be such a shame that the owner goes through this property management company.
0 ||| Believe the hype.  The first time I ever made it in to this place, the same Calexico song playing in my truck was playing on their stereo as well, so they immediately scored some brownie points.  My favorite here is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich, and I generally believe that nothing can be good without meat.  This sangwich disproves that theory, admittedly weak and simple-minded to begin with, but still... amazing, amazing place, especially when the weather's good and you can sit outside.  The staff are usually rude, but fuck it - another case of holier-than-thou hipster a**holes saved by 6-star food.  The owner seems like a good enough dude.
4 ||| Admittedly, I've never had the lunch buffet; as for the dinner menu, though? Delicious! The Boy and I eat there at least once a week, often twice. We go through withdrawals if we're away too long!\n\nSince we're both veg*n, I can only attest to the Vegetarian offerings, but between the two of us, I think we've had everything in the Veg section, and we've never had a bad meal here. Every plate has the option of mild/medium/spicy, and extra rice is always available free (even when you take half of the food home, as I usually have to do). The portions are perfect in that, if you're like him, it's a perfect stomach-stuffer -  and if you're like me, I always have leftovers for the next day! \n\nParticularly good dishes are the Baingan Bhartha, Vegetable Mango, and Bhindi Masala (The cheese-eating Boy swears by the Saag Mushroom and Paneer Jalfrazie). The Samosas are wonderful, and the onion chutney is always amazing. Be sure to add a Taj Mahal beer for the perfect meal. :)\n\nThe prices are great (two meals, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks comes to less than $30 before tipping). The service is always prompt and friendly, and while the atmosphere is casual (we often venture in in hoodies and jeans), you could easily make it a nice date outing (the lighting is soft and the decor nice enough). Taj is an all-around great establishment with a great family-owned feel that's friendly without being overbearing.
2 ||| Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.
0 ||| Leave car at 8 am for oil change. I am\nSecond in line. Technician won't be there till 9:30am. Fine, I say. I'll go have breakfast and call me when car is ready. 2 hours later, no call. I finally walk back and open the door, the lady who took my number down, looks up and says, Oh. Yeah. You're ready to go. I ask what happened to my phone call. She vacillates between \"I forgot\" and \"It was busy\". I'm so tired after getting off work at 5 am, I don't have the strength to argue. Now I have less than 4 hrs to nap before my next shift at 3:30 pm. Hendertucky is lucky today, because properly rested, I'd have been on the midday news dragging her through the parking lot. Oh, and the car was done by 9:16, from the paperwork. Very disappointing. I will not be back since they think so little over their customers.
1 ||| Apparently Bruce does good work for reasonable rates, but please do not attempt to patronize this business unless you are fond of being verbally abused and talked down to in the worst possible way. I had heard that he was rude, but I let it slide, thinking maybe people were too sensitive. I should have heeded the warnings, as I have never before wanted to punch a grown man in the face as I the one time I visited his shop. Plus, we didn't even get any help with the bike... Bruce just made insinuations about the shop where we had purchased the bike and wanted us to try to get information from the shop and then bring it back to him. It was all kinds of creepy and unhelpful.
3 ||| My wife and I had lunch here, and we were both very impressed. She had a frozen strawberry margarita that she said was one of the best she ever had; I'm not a margarita guy, but I tried it and was blown away.\n\nThe service was solid, and the food was pretty good. It's a little strange that fries aren't an advertised side with burgers (and therefore cost extra), but it wasn't a huge jump in price so I didn't think of it as a huge deal.\n\nAll in all, a solid place to get a quick, informal bite to eat.
4 ||| The food was absolutely amazing and the live band was the cherry on top!! What a great date place. This restaurant has such a nice ambience and we could not have asked for any more. And a special thank you to  Bridget L. for making our experience that much better!!
4 ||| Fun fact: all of the tiger decor is DONATED! \n\nMy husband and I have been wanting to go here for a long time, mostly because of the camp factor. It seemed really cheesy and fun. Turns out, it is AMAZING. Here is the low-down of why I love this place. \n\nAtmosphere - Outside of the very obvious and corny tiger decor, this is the kind of place you could come to in a cocktail dress or jeans and a t-shirt and fit in (I know because we saw that exact combination while we were there). If you stay for more than a few drinks, you might forget where you are or what time of day it is because it is quite dark inside. Other than than, it is a standard townie bar dressed to the nines, complete with obligatory free, stale popcorn. There is ample parking, but you might not want to drive (see Drinks)\n\nDrinks - I got a Tom Collins. My husband got a Manhattan. These are the types of drinks you should order at this place. They make a fabulous, no frills, strong mixed drink. As it should be. This is Wisconsin, after all.\n\nStaff - I've only ever been there when a younger man was bartending, but he was fabulous. He was chatty and friendly without being annoying. And he had a sense of humor about his white shirt and bow tie. \n\nTake home - Le Tigre is not only special because of it's camp and decor. It is fabulous because they put some crimson lipsick on tired, old hole in the wall and made her look like Scarlet Johansson.
4 ||| Stopped in to this BIG restaurant for lunch today, & ordered their \"Hot Roasted Turkey Sandwich with all the Trimmings\"; the trimmings being mashed potatoes & turkey gravy, dressing, & a side cup of cold, full-fruit style cranberry sauce.\n\nHere's how it was for me:\n\n*  A friendly greeting from the manager (owner?) when I entered!\n\n*  Fast, friendly service on the cafeteria style food serving line!\n\n*  A generous plate of food...  really piled up!\n\nNow this was not quite as amazing as the same order at My Mother's Restaurant, where you get an even bigger hot turkey sandwich PLUS a trip to the salad bar, for only 29 cents more!  With that said, this meal here at Park Central Deli was delicious, & an excellent value at $7.99.  I'm very likely to return!    :-))
1 ||| My wife and I came back to this place from a long vacation, we just wanted to stop by and have a couple drinks and the bartender tells me you been 86 I can't serve you and they don't want your business!  I said excuse me? I asked for a manager there no managers so I've asked for a security person and I explain to him what just happened and he asked me have we ever said to you you been 86? I said no, have we ever taken you're photo? I said absolutely not, he said then he's fine\" he said to the bartender,  so the bartender apologizes and give us 2 drinks on the house. We just got up and left from then on they don't deserve our business. The bartender \"Primo\" should gets his facts right before saying I've never felt so humiliated I was going to report him to his cooperate office which I doubt they would do anything this will satisfy me.
0 ||| Can I give no stars.  What a horrible place to get service work done. got an estimate for tune up on a hedge trimmer and a weed eater.   So the hedge trimmer they gave me a horrible estimate that was more than double what it should have been when I said no they told me I owed a 18 dollar fee for the estimate and said I should just leave the trimmer since it is not worth any thing.  I ended up selling for 150 on craigs list FYI with out the tune up.   they even charged to add string to test the weed eater.  Place is a total rip off I will never go again.
4 ||| Very friendly staff. Nice selection and food was good. Great for a casual lunch or dinner!
2 ||| Fun little hole in the wall. Back behind the Starbucks at 16th and Bethany Home Rd.
0 ||| This company is brutal!  Brutal service, and products relative to the competition. \n\nDo not sign a contract with these guys it is a nightmare to get out of and it is super long term.
2 ||| I normally am very picky about Chinese restaurants and this is not one I would have tried on my own volition.  However, my neighbors love it and suggested we get take-out from here one night.   I  personally found the quality of the food to be lacking...my cashew chicken was sort of greasy and the chicken had a chewy-icky consistency..... but what can you expect when you are paying $7.95 for a dinner entree?   Also, they serve their entrees with fried rice and an egg roll but  I really prefer brown rice and a spring roll.  Next time I am in the mood for Chinese food,  I'll stick to Wan Fu or Jo-Jo China Bistro.
2 ||| 3.5 Stars!\n\nI have always liked P.F. Chang's. \n\nThe food is delicious.  The appetizers from their famous lettuce wraps to their salt & pepper calamari.\n\nNicely lit - dim yet, easy on the eyes - brings comfort to a very loud place.  Not a romantic place.  More on a good place to eat out once in a while with a fun group of friends and family - and I now have my parents doing take out on occasion.\n\nThey are good to hook you in and make you want to go back.\n\nThey should think about opening up one in SOMA here in SF.  They would have my business.  Otherwise, trekking out to the one in Emeryville isn't so bad - but, it seems so far across the bay bridge... hehehe (san francisco joke).
0 ||| First, my friend bought a Groupon and asked me to give Super Mex a try.  Mexican food isn't my favorite and when I go I tend to split my visits between Coyote's or Lindo Michoacan.\nOur waitress was rude and neglectful.  I don't know if it's because my friend and I are white, that we had a Groupon, or if she was having a bad night.\nShe never brought refills, never checked the table between the time she brought our order and when she put the check down, it took her 10 minutes after running the check to come back and let my friend know the Groupon covered the tab (it was NOT busy last night at 5:30).  \nI won't be going back because service that bad doesn't deserve a second chance.
1 ||| I had eaten at this same restaurant in San Diego, so when I came across one in Vegas, I got pretty excited. Unfortunately, this location wasn't as good. It might be because it's open 24 hours and it's in the worst city to live in, but the service was pretty bad. The pizza we ordered was also more greasy than what I had remembered, and it took forever to get everything. We ordered hummus as an appetizer and they gave us a huge serving of it, with very little pita bread which was annoying. The price and portions aren't bad and I liked that I was just the right amount of full after my meal vs. the usual stuff-your-face buffets scattered throughout Vegas.
0 ||| This place is easy on the eyes...it's actually quite lovely.\n\nFrom a functionality standpoint, I've seen better, however.\n\nI come here every year for the expo for the marathon and it's decent for that.  However, the bathrooms are way too small and for some reason, the sink in the men's room throws water everywhere so the floor is wet.\n\nWet bathroom floors are not my bag, baby.  You never know if it's water or something more sinister.\n\nNicer cans would net this place another star.
0 ||| I tried to eat here tonight using a $25 gift certificate purchased from Restaurant.com.  After waiting over 15 minutes for my server to stop by for my order, I showed her my gift certificate.  She told me they stopped taking them, however I had just purchased it 15 minutes earlier.  \n\nI spoke to the manager and he wasn't the least bit interested.  He told me Restaurant.com was a scam (I have used it before with no problems) and he hasn't been able to get in touch with them to cancel.  While I was still talking to him, he answered a call on his cell phone without even saying excuse me.  He obviously didn't care at all.\n\nI called Restaurant.com for a refund, and told them what he said.  They told me that they have actually been trying to get in touch with the restaurant for weeks.  I can only assume he owes them money or something.  Either way, it is outrageous that he will not honor a gift certificate for a program he agreed to sign up for.\n\nBeyond this problem, I can't recommend this place simply based on how awfully they dealt with this issue.  I didn't get a chance to try any food and I never will.
0 ||| Horrible parking.  If you take the parallel spaces, look out for people backing out.  If you take the regular space, look out for the parallel cars.  The best place to park is on the south side of their lot, or just past the drive thru area.\nI got a little ticked off today.  I dont have a BofA checking account so I had to see a human to make a payment.  The lines were long.  Only one designated merchant teller with a lot of merchant activity, so the lines moved really slow.\nThen the teller that took my payment saw that I was paying with a check from a Credit Union, so she looked up my other services and started to ask me questions about my CU checking account.  She was trying to cross-sell me.  If you want to have your employees cross sell, at least train them to what kind of products you are trying to steer your clients off of.  She could not comprehend that my CU pays me to use my checking account.  2.25% int on balances under 1,000 and rebates all atm fees up to $20.  Nothing BofA would ever offer
4 ||| I'm very picky about my eyebrows it has taken me years to find someone that Keeps them nice and arch and thick . In desperate need I thought id give them a try and best decision ever made! Jennifer is amazing at eyebrows I can't express that enough. She is the only one I trust with them and I've been going to her for over a year.
4 ||| I had a date with Mama Jo last night and she chose Abuelo's. Though she pronounced it Aruba's. And the Ablegos. We finallly figured it out and arrived to a very bustling restaurant.\n\nIt definitely has the look of a medium end Vegas casino restaurant meets Macayo's...but all in all, I liked the decor, very bright and \"atrium\" like. We were greeted & seated, immediately and with kindness and professionalism. As we were being escorted to our table, I'm taking in the ambience, VERY busy and a HUGE crowd of SMALL little girls, half dressed in tu tu's. I kid you not. I thought it was teen drag night at a gay bar for a moment. \n\nAs we nestled into our booth away from the screaming tweens, our delightful, delightful server, Ashley, informed us they were on the way to the Justin Beiber concert. How cute is that? Cuter that they were finished and leaving, but I digress.\n\nI have to say, I truly appreciate a lot of chain restaurant requirements of the service staff. I like being asked if I've been in before. The specials. Soups of the day. Etc., etc. As long as they are not robotic and comfortable and smiling, I'm all ears. Five stars for Ashley.\n\nMom & I hadn't been out in awhile as we've (aka, ME) have been busy packing up for our move to Minneapolis. But she is as charming as she is lovely and it was nice to spend time with her outside of the house. We started with chips, three kinds of salsa (all explained, which I really appreciated) and an order of guacamole. I loved the THIN, crispy and fresh chips though they struggled to pick up the yummy, chunky guacamole without breaking. Oh, the problems we have!!!\n\nWe both ordered enchiladas, mom had ground beef and I went for cheese and a carnitas. Carnitas was sad and dry. Much like my Aunt Helen towards her final years. But the sauce was pretty flavorful. A big plus for the frijoles which had a great pork flavor infused and Papas Chiles...amazing, mashed taters with cheese. Carb city!\n\nWe finished with the obligatory chain chocolate lava cake. All in all for a chain restaurant, it was dang good. Ashley checked in when appropriate. I noticed two other nearby servers and their demeanor with guests and was most impressed.\n\nSo, Aruba's, er um Ablegos or wait Abuelo's, I might see ya before I move!
4 ||| I always get the same thing at Mexican restaurants, a green chili burro enchilada style - boring, I know but tonight it was different. The meat was tender and choice cuts, the sauce smooth and spiced exactly like I like it. Beans and rice on the plate were also excellent. I am always looking for the \"old school\" Mexican food that I knew as a kid. Well this is the place! \n\nMe dinner companion had fajitas, a combo of steak and chicken, which were the best that I had tried anywhere  in the Valley. I was surprised because the old style restaurants usually don't do fajitas well, because they are not traditional.\n\nWe both had margaritas, very good, and also traditional. Meal topped off with ice cream with cinnamon, pastry, whipped cream - what could be bad about that?\n\nOur service was outstanding by all employees, fast water, chips and salsa, drinks, and dinner. Friendly, professional staff added to an experience that I hope to repeat again and again.
4 ||| Not a fan of chains but I had been wanting to go here for a while to try the steak.  The food is good but the service you get here is top notch. Great place to celebrate an event such as a birthday or promotion - just make sure someone else picks up the tab...wink wink.
1 ||| As we walked in the door we noticed it was hot & stuffy. \n\nOf the 15 or so tables/booths, only about six were occupied, so they were not crowded for breakfast at 9:30 Sunday (10/24/10.)\n\nAfter being seated the girl who brings coffee brought us ours and then the wait began.  \n\nAfter around 5 minutes, I decided to start my watch timer. It showed 12 minutes plus the 5 before for a total wait--for-the-waitress time of about 17 minutes, to take our order. I have had to wait like this just about every time I have come to this restaurant. \n\nThen the time dragged on as we waited for our breakfast.  I didn't check my watch this time but I had plenty of time to drink all my coffee without a refill before our bacon and eggs arrived.\n\nThe food was good & the cost is one of the lowest in Wickenburg. The decor (old West) is fun & interesting! The service is mediocre - IMHO!
0 ||| Most of the reviewers must have been high or drunk when they gave this place such high praise.  Went here with a friend for lunch today.  First off, there was no ac.  No ac in the middle of the summer?  Hopefully it was just broken.  The food was very subpar compared to any bertos out there.  My friend got a regular beef enchilada and it was stuffed with onions and green peppers.  Wtf?  I ordered the California burrito and it was very bland and not very tasty.  I had to dump salsa on every bite to liven it up a bit.  Finally when we left, my friend had filled up her drink and accidentally left it near the soda dispenser.  She walked me to my car and remembered, so she went back in.  They had already thrown it away and refused to give her another cup.  I will never come back to this dump again.  If you're looking for an amazing taco shop at 3:30 in the morning, head to Taco Migo near the intersection of I-10 and baseline.  I've never been disappointed with the food or service there.
1 ||| This place is overrated. The food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown. I guess the private ownership and legacy reputation leads people to give it more credit than it deserves. You also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit.
4 ||| If you like Hawaiian food this is one of the best places in town.  Large portions, great price, Fridays they have specials - Lau Lau!!!!  \nThe Spicy Korean is another must try - dont forget the punch.
4 ||| Its a good deal for lunch. If you're downtown & need a quick bite, I'd stop in. The service is fast & pretty friendly. The sushi is nothing to write home about, but its worth the price.
0 ||| Total RIP OFF. I went into the store for a price quote on a new motor and some replacement cartridges and they gave me a reasonable price but when I called them to come out to do the work they charged me an extra  15% on the cartridges then what they had quoted they would cost. The repair man also did not bring the replacement motor that was ordered so he could charge me for an extra 45 minutes while he drove back to the store to get the motor he had forgotten. I was also told that the new motor would come with a new pump housing in the original quote which it did not. When I called to ask the manager about the pricing he was immediately standoffish and hostile. I couldn't believe that they treat their customers this poorly. The repairman had done about  25 minutes  of work and they charged me 210.00 dollars in labor alone not to mention a price increase of about 15% for all the parts quoted. For about 50 more bucks I could have replaced the entire system. I would advise anyone looking to have their pool serviced to go else where and avoid this dishonest company.
4 ||| We were looking for a sea food restaurant off the Vegas strip, when we found the Landrys sea food . The ambience is great, the food is awesome and prices are reasonable. I have not seen any sea food places where the food is great, the quantity of food is right and the price is reasonable. It is a place that will be the top of my list when I visit LV next time, should be yours too.
4 ||| This is the ONLY place I will go to for my hair.  Samantha has been doing my hair now for the last 12 years and I've followed her around from different salons and finally to here.  She does an awesome job and I always gets tons of compliments.
1 ||| Oh Charlotte, I fly you once a year, during Thanksgiving and I'm the one who gets in before all the amateurs (or that's what I try to do at least).  I love you more now that you have SWA flying through you.  I just hate trying to have to eyeball which security gate to go through because certain checkpoints are always busy as all heck.\n\nHaving the food court right outside security is kind of awkward and gets crowded.  I appreciate the free wifi and the fact that it's not insane to try and navigate.  Rocking chairs for those who like them.  In terms of drop off/ pick up, during high flight arrivals, it's insanely busy traffic wise....that needs fixed
3 ||| good place to go out for late dinner.  Open till 3:00 AM.  Price little bit expensive than what I usually pay for Com thit nuong.
0 ||| Please don't stay here.  We've paid $300.00 a night and thought this was great for the whole family to enjoy the water park.  The water slide and lazy river is not working !!!!\nThe room here is old and not worth the money.  Our keys doesn't work when we checked in. Had to get a second set and still doesn't work.  I hate this place.  I wish I went to a real hotel and a real water park.
4 ||| *****THIS RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED***** (We were there on closing night, by chance, and heard it from the owners' daughter's mouth- it was time for them to retire). \n\nIt's hard to choose between Silver Dragon and Gourmet House of Hong Kong. Hubby and I live mere blocks from GHoHK, and have had many excellent meals there. We'd read some reviews of SD in New Times, and decided to give it a try. Unlike the previous reviewer's experience, the place was full of Asians at dinner time. The \"regular\" menu had all the Americanized standards, but GHoHK had already trained us to be more adventurous with the second menu, written mostly in Chinese. Hubby and I agreed that the soups and the mixed appetizer plates are better at GHoHK, but that our entrees had better flavor at SD (although GHoHK's are prettier). Hubby had a mixed meat Singapore flat noodle with a curry sauce that, when we heated up the left-overs for dinner tonight, said was even better the second time. I had the beef chow fun, dry sauteed. Delicious. Both places are decor-dives, but clean, with fast and friendly service.
4 ||| Love this theater!  Probably my favorite in the Valley.  The location is great, none of my East Valley friends have a problem meeting here, since it's right off the 60.\n\nThe staff is always friendly, the theaters and restrooms are clean.  The sounds is awesome, and the stadium style seating means that I never have to worry about who is sitting in front of me.  With plenty of theaters, there's always a good selection, if there's nothing good playing, it's Hollywood's fault.\n\nI love the shopping center it's in too, lots of great stores and restaurants near by.\n\nNow if they could just invent a laser that zaps those annoying plot talkers - you know the ones who sit there and say stuff like \"Oooohh, is he gonna open the door?  Oh, he opened the door! Why did he open the door?  What do you think he's going to do now that the door is open?  Do you think he'll go through the door?\"
4 ||| Great breakfast place!  Yummy homemade pumpkin bread and awesome selection on omelette's.  Very generous portions! Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Vegas!
0 ||| First of all I saw this resturaurant on diners drive ins and dives. I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the hard shell carne Asada tacos, they were awful. They tasted like rubber just very bland. I think the meat might have been over cooked. Needless to say I will not be returning
3 ||| What a nice little co-op market! It's small but it has all the basics and a great meat market in back. All local sourced, if possible, otherwise what you'd expect from a good co-op. They even carried a few varieties of Theo Chocolate. If you're a member of Willy Street Co-op, your card is good here so, check it out!
3 ||| This is a good location, in terms of freshness. Always a good selection of salad junk, and the soups are good. Avoid their pre-compiled salads, as they basically negate any healthy benefit you might get from eating there. I don't know what's up with the pasta, though -- they've got the worse pasta I've ever tasted. They would do better just to open some cans of Franco-American.\n\nOn another downside, this place is kind of ludicrously priced when you think about it. $3 for a drink? It's not a movie theater, man. They do have a discount if you have a Phoenix Zoo membership, so bring your card.
0 ||| First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.\n\nIts always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. \n\nWe actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. \n\nJust go anywhere else, it can't be worse!
0 ||| One star up!\n\nAfter my most recent visit to Sammy's, I believe they are deserving of a better rating. \n\nAs far as the food, we ordered the Kobe Beef chili, the kids' pepperoni pizza, LaDou's BBQ Chicken Pizza, & the Brie & Truffle Oil pizza on gluten-free crust. My boyfriend said the chili was tasty, but thought there wasn't much beef. All three pizzas were great. The Brie & Truffle Oil pizza is a new addition to their menu, and it was DELICIOUS! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...\n\nI still don't care for the location, I wish they had more visual marketing to show they're back there with all the offices. I still think that the tapas are pretty pricey (unless you get there for half-off happy hour). Regardless, we loved the new revamped menu (labeling all vegetarian, vegan, & gluten-free items), and service was awesome! \n\nThank you for replying to my previous review. We'll be back. Hopefully during happy hour!
0 ||| I got a pedicure from here yesterday. I was not happy. Jeannie didn't cut my cuticles very well so I could see there was a space between the polish and my toenail. I told her about it and she argued with me. I will not return. This place was completely empty the whole time I was there and now I know why.
4 ||| The dancing upstairs is pretty awesome if you are in college, if not I wouldn't recommend it.  Downstairs is a good place to chill for a drink or two, but idk about a whole night there.
4 ||| Tons of cute Hooter's girls, but I've been there twice since moving to Champaign and it seems like their wings consistently lack any crunch, even soggy. Everything tastes fine, just missing some texture.
4 ||| Awesome! I came here to get name tags for my nursing program. They offered five for $27 plus tax, which made it under $30. The woman who helped me was very nice and asked me when I wanted them ready. I said, whenever, As I wasn't in too much of a rush. She called me in an hour to let me know they were ready. GREAT service! I will go nowhere else for my name tag needs.
2 ||| This place has an awesome location and view, but the food needs major improvement. The omelette and homefries I had were way underseasoned and overcooked. The food here is cheap and quick to come out to the table, but there are better breakfast places out there.\n\nFor a quick breakfast venue, I'd have to give this place 3/5 stars. I know that this place caters to many undergraduates, but they don't have to sacrifice on quality and taste just to be attractive to poor undergraduates.
0 ||| Not really for females under 45.
0 ||| OK! I will never order anything else from this place it will always be known to me as:\n\nTHE BEST GARLIC CHICKEN I'VE EVER HAD!\n\nThat's all......!
0 ||| Took my dog here. It was the only place that doesn't require proof of shots. Pretty decent for my poor side. I can't cut my dogs nails cause they are black and I clip them too close and make him bleed every time I try. They gave him back to me and all seemed okay. Got him in the truck and he starts bleeding everywhere. Really I could have done that myself and save the gas and the cost of it. I won't be going back here. They get 1 star just because you don't need proof of shots to bring your animal there
0 ||| I driven by this place a few times, saying to myself, I gotta try it!\nI finally had the opportunity to & i was brutally disappointed!  \n\nI went during the lunch hour. Had an OK crowd inside. On the menu Board, it says \"try it, you'll love it\" So i did. I paid almost $7.00 for my steak sandwich. It didn't take that long to cook. (that part I was impressed.) When I got my sandwich, it was a skinny little thing. I took my first bite & the sweet peppers were cold. I usually like to eat the whole sandwich, but I had to leave pieces of bread behind because they were, just that, bread!\n\nI've had steak sandwiches before (in philly) & they are soooo good. Nothing compares to it! but if your craving one, don't come here. Go to the other place that starts with a \"C\"
4 ||| Loving this downtown Phoenix hotel! Views are wonderful and the hotel is beautiful inside. Bed is comfy and the room is nicely decorated with every convenience. I like that there is a bar on the main floor - a great restaurant on the top floor and an Einsteins bagels attached if you need a quick nosh. The location is the perfect place for exploring everything phoenix has to offer - close to baseball and basketball and all the downtown nightlife. A great hotel and worth the money.
4 ||| This is a great place for a staycation!!!  It really feels like you are at a Mexican resort.  We went in July and got good use of the pool.  It is smaller, but served it's purpose of relaxation and had really attentive service.  The rooms are very nice and romantic.   They have a great lounge with live music and excellent mixologists.  I didn't get a chance to try the  restaurant, so I will definitely return for that, as I have read and heard great things.  If I remember correctly, all tips are included so no need to worry about awkwardly pulling out your wallet.  Highly recommend!
4 ||| Quickly sat at table 3:45pm on Tuesday. It happened to be happy hour. Half off on Kirin beer. I had a bottle of blueberry sake and hot green tea.  The blueberry sake is sparkling and sweet.  The ramen had balanced flavor.  The black cod was a good firm texture a little fishier than I prefer. Mini corn dogs have a curry batter that is very light.  There is a juicy crunch to them. I dipped it in spicy mayo. The yellowtail sashimi mixed with avocado was served over rice/tomato/onion sandwiched between what looked similar to fried wonton. This was nice and fresh tasting the crispy part was flaky and not hard. Nicely put together.  I REALLY wanted the honey toast.  I only had a little more room left in my and my boyfriend didn't want any. I didn't think it would be worth spending almost $8 for dessert that I could not finish alone. Our service was quick and attentive.  I'm happy with the food here. Total before tax $61.13.
2 ||| I'd say 3 stars is pretty accurate. The 1/4 chicken and Mac n Cheese I had were decent.  Its average food.  The cashier needs to be nicer to customers. Overall, its alright, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.
3 ||| Came here for lunch on a business trip out to Charlotte, NC.  I'm from California, so I had no idea what to expect when we went here for a quick bite to eat.  \n\nThis place is situated in the middle of a shopping plaza-like setting.  We were seated promptly, however, there were 6 people in our party and we had to squeeze in to a table that normally fits 4 comfortably.  They do have a decent menu with normal lunch items you would find at any chain restaurant.  Wait staff was polite. Food on the other hand was mediocre and a bit on the greasy side.  \n\nOverall it was a fast lunch, nothing really special but also nothing really awful.  I'd suggest though that if you're looking for a nice lunch worth talking about then you should find somewhere else to go.
0 ||| If I could give this store negative stars, I would.  I went in there on Sunday to shop for some pants for my daughter.  She is short and wide (she has down syndrome) and there are some pull on pants with pockets that she loves there, deep pockets for her cell phone.  We find 4 pair of pants in her size (amazing in itself), I got an article of clothing , and I got a printer cable.  As usual, there were only 3 cash registers open (on a sunday at noon)  so we go through the help yourself aisle.  Line moves fast and I notice that that there is a person standing right in the middle of the do it yourself lines ringing people up also, so as it's my turn, I can either pick a do it yourself or go to her, so I go to her (don't like the do it yourself).  I have 6 items, 4 exactly the same.  She tell me \"you have too many items, I can't help  you.\"  Really, 6 items is too many for you?  So as usual, poor customer service in this store.  So I turn around, and of course every one of the do it yourself registers are now full.  So not only can she not help me, because I have 6 items (too many for her little Walmart brain to handle) but I now get to stand in line again.  I walked.  I have had very poor customer service in this store again and again, and I keep coming back.  This was the last straw.  I  have also written Walmart, and I bet you money that I will never hear from them.  It's all about volume for this company, they could really give a shit about customer service.  As long as all the people come to their stores and spend money, that's all this corporation cares about.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from Walmart.  I know they are less expensive that Safeway, but not at the expense of your sanity, and if you expect anything resembling customer service, you won't get it here.  STAY AWAY!
0 ||| I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!
1 ||| Another lunch outing with the fiance.\n\nThis time at Coffee Pub Restaurant. We ate outside because it was a nice day and the atmosphere was nice. The restaurant seemed clean and had its own style. \n\nI ordered the Pub Dip (French Dip basically). It came with roast beef, sauteed mushrooms and onions, with melted mozzarella cheese. It was excellent! The au jus was flavorful and the sandwich itself was too. I was definitely wanting more afterward. \n\nThe fiance got breakfast croissant and it came with diced potatoes. I didn't have a chance to try the sandwich but I did try the potatoes because they looked awesome. They were just ok unfortunately. The were cooked perfectly but had zero seasoning. The fiance said the same of the sandwich. Having not tried it, I can't really make an accurate assessment of it. \n\nAll in all, I would like to come back to try other things. She would too, but didn't have a great first impression. I'm still wanting more of the Pub Dip.
0 ||| We're used to the great service from the Arizona Rubio's that this Rubio's doesn't compare.  Only my husband was eating and it was 3 fish tacos.  It took SOOOO long for them to make these, it wasn't funny.  I saw other people get their food and leave and still he hadn't gotten his tacos.  He finally got his tacos.\n\nAnyway, thankfully the Rubio's we go to all have better service.  This wasn't the worst, and we had had bad service at a McDonald's the day before, so the fact we didn't get great service was a bit of a shock as well as a disappointment.
0 ||| Although this retail location appears to be stocked with merchandise, the staff seems disinterested in helping. They would prefer to assist clientele who are on the thinner / fitter/ younger side of life. Anything else they really don't have the attention span for.\n\nAs witnessed on multiple visits.\n\n[Head Shake]\n\nBefore I dropped a chunk of mass I ventured into this store. I would have spent the world and the moon that day. (The mgr of sales in training at my gym had sent me over to \"invest\" in protein what not.) I had a very specific product to purchase and a list of other \"maybes\".\n\nYeah, this is before I started eating clean. Anyway, I had some questions. But the same very tall, dark haired lad, had to help a gal. With her cell phone. And then with mints. And some other critical stuff.\n\nI get it. Flirting. Sure, on the job. Go forth, do that.\n\nBut when I finally had his attention, he had the audacity to be annoyed. At the actual paying customer. (vs. the gal that works next door and pops in all the time.)\n\nHoy Vey. Kids. I get 'ya. \nBut help the old ones with their wallets wide open next time.\n\nPeriodically I would stop in there on my way to Sports Authority. To buy some energy bars. SAME THING.\n\nThen I changed my food vocabulary and never, ever, needed to go in there.\n\nDON'T GO.
3 ||| Went here because I wanted authentic greasy stick to your ribs Mexican food. Unfortunately all I got was the greasy part. \n\nI ordered a combo enchilada and taco platter. The shredded beef was dry and the whole plate was just too salty. It came with an ample helping of beans and rice, which were tasty but nothing special.\n\nHowever I do have to agree that this place has great chips and salsa. And the wait staff is very generous with them. \n\nI just wish the rest of the meal had lived up to the chips.
0 ||| I will admit, I made fun of the boyfriend when he wanted to go to 5 & Diner for dinner last night. I made even more fun of him when he showed me $80 worth of vouchers he'd bought on Amazon Local. Who goes to the 5 & Diner? Apparently he does. \n\nSo we went to the 5 & Diner.\nAnd it was really good.\n\nPickle chips! A whole star just for having these! They were delicious.\n\nI had the \"Diner Dip\"; the meat was nothing special but the bun was soft (I can't count how many places give me a hard-as-a-rock bun on French dips) and the horseradish sour cream was yummy. Boyfriend had some kind of burger, and it was one hell of a burger for under $10; this thing was literally 6 inches tall and densely packed with meat, jalapenos, cheese, and onion rings between Texas toast. He lapsed into a happy food coma quite quickly. French fries were perfectly cooked and tasted fresh. \n\nThe shakes... oh, the shakes. We had the Reeses Peanut Butter Cup as a malt. It was amazing. Chunks of peanut butter cups at the bottom even!  I loved that they had about 20 flavors, ranging from butterscotch to raspberry to chocolate cherry, and all could be done as malts, soda floats, or just regular shakes. So many options!\n\nEverything came out super fast; 5 minutes on the pickle chips and another 5 for our sandwiches. I was astounded to find it had come out like lightning without being held under lamps; they literally cook that quickly. \n\nOh, and now I have to rave about our server: She was the sweetest girl I've ever seen in food service. She was genuinely so nice, not the fake front most servers (including myself) put on, that I was incredibly impressed. She had to take my iPhone to do our voucher and it was crazy to see how carefully she handled it and presented it back to me. I enjoyed her pleasant demeanor so much that I left 40% for tip (and even perfect service will rarely warrant more than a 20% tip from me, because most of them have the aforementioned sickeningly sweet fake front).\nI didn't catch her name, but she had black hair and a nose stud, and worked on Tuesday night, so management please give kudos to her :)
0 ||| Never coming back here. Came In for a dry trim. This is when they do not wash your hair, they just dust off some uneven ends usually $5-15. The entire time this Asian lady just kept insulting my hair, from my color to the cut to some damage (my hair is not that bad at all). She kept pushing for a million little things as I kept repeating I just want a dry trim please. She wouldn't stop! Then insisted on cutting it shorter than I wanted. I said no and she did it anyway and said it would look better. It doesn't. Then she charged me $35 for a $5 service. Ridiculous, I will never return.
0 ||| This place has ruin its reputation faster than Tiger Woods. When I came here a while back, I remember reviews being positive but I had my doubts. \n\nAfter tasting the pho, I knew I had good reasons to be doubtful. The broth and noodles were flavorless. The only saving grace was the rest of the ingredients were acceptable and my Pho did come out hot.\n\nThe only way you can have worse service than an Asian restaurant is not even executing the simplest request. I asked the water 3 times till I finally got my first cup of water. Water or some other drink should be given when  you sit down with your menu. The waiter just couldn't remember a cup of water, and there was only 2 other small groups in the restaurant. I'm surprised he actually got the right order.\n\nThere are a bunch of other places on Spring Mountain, try one of those instead.
4 ||| Susan's is a great local shop that I enjoy visiting whenever I'm back seeing my family. \n\nNestled a little bit in the middle-of-nowhere and yet pretty easy to find, the shop sits happily amongst the working outbuildings of a beautiful sheep farm. Lots of happy wool inside and out!\n\nSusan is a gracious host and shop owner and was brilliant in helping me with a unique special order a while back (all via email). She's always up for a chat and is an interesting lady.  The shop is well-stocked with a variety of yarns that I've not found at other yarn shops in Wisconsin. This shop is definitely worth a short drive to the country!
0 ||| Shady pricing!!! I took my 12 year old nephew there and they charged me $17.00 for a fade. The price chart say that children under 13 are $14.00. When I questioned the inaccurate fee I was told that it's an extra $3.00 to get \"lined up\" which wasn't even given to us as an option nor was it on the price chart. We will never go back and we will continue to spread the word about their shady prices and hidden fees.
3 ||| Yum!  I just moved to Charlotte recently and am slowly working my way through the food options.  I've known of Dish from the rave reviews of friends since long before I moved here.  Once I finally got to try it, I wasn't disappointed.  Went with a friend on a Saturday evening and had no problem getting a table even though it was definitely crowded.  The atmosphere is unassuming and homey and the food is delicious!  I had a mahi special with mac & cheese while my friend had chicken & dumplings and declared them better than her grandmother's.  We both had the strawberry/peach pie...also fabulous.  The only very minor thing I'd say is that it isn't a good place to go if you're looking for a quiet atmosphere.  It was a bit on the noisy side which didn't detract in any way from my experience.  Looking forward to future visits.
3 ||| First time in a Waffle house and I liked it, pretty busy place. My boyfriend told me there's better waffle houses and he was disappointed because it was my first time in a waffle house and claimed that they're mediocre. So if you're a waffle house junky this place might not be for you. But what do I  know lol.
4 ||| UPDATE:  Forgot to mention-- for $40, you can get a discount card which gets you 20% off any regular purchase for 1 year.  This means if you buy more than $200 in merch, it'll pay for itself.  With one bra being about $40 to $60, it's worth it for me. \n\nInspired by previous reviewer Rachel B, I gotta agree.  Victoria's Secret may have big time busty supermodels, and leopard prints, but ain't got nothing on I C London fitting and customer service. I'm a totally different size than previously thought. \n\nWhen you're 100 pounds, even a 32 band is too big.  I C London is one of the few places where you can get a 30 band-- or have your current bras altered.  Who knew this service even existed!?\n\nWhen you get fitted here-- you will be adjusted, and re-adjusted and try on tons of bras until the SA or owner is satisfied with the determined size.  Over at VS, you're told what will fit you for the sizes they carry in store.  The fitters there are all given a formula for their pink tape measure, and once they determine what size you are-- eyeballs the fit.  \n\nTrust me.  The difference between wearing an ill fitting bra versus one built for your body is incredible.  Your posture will be different, the girls will be perkier and overall better shaped. \n\nNo, there is no funkified feathered stuff or neon colors-- primarily nude, white, black and neutrals.  Practical pieces that wear well under clothes.  (Need something for that strapless dress or one-shouldered tank, you'll find it here.)\n\nKeep in mind, the designers who make special sizes aren't cheap, but you'll be taught how to care for your bras correctly, and be shown special detergents to use while washing.  \n\nPS:  There's a nice section for super-comfy sleepwear too!
0 ||| Terrible quality work and ruined my repair work prior to painting. Left lights loose, ruined my lock. Rip off don't go here.
0 ||| I liked the Tea Station near where I used to live in Fremont, CA.  And was glad to find another one out here in Las Vegas.  Their menu is pretty much the same as the one I remembered from California.\n\nThe drinks are good (but again made from powders like most other boba tea places), and the bobas are cooked well.  It is a pretty relaxed and chill place to hang out, get some snacks, play some cards or surf the web while you kill some time.\n\nService is usually good, but can sometimes be rather poor if you end up with a rude server that is most likely a mainland China transplant.\n\nWhat I like about this place:\nthe snacks I have tried have mostly been good (Sweet butter toast, tea boiled eggs, Tea flavored fried spicy chicken-can also be prepared non-spicy).\n\nDislikes:\n2 waitresses that can be rather rude.\nCost less to order the drinks to go, but these orders do not count towards their Buy 10 Get 1 Free promo card.\n\nAnd prepared to pay in cash, or they will charge a small fee for paying with credit cards.
4 ||| I have such a love/hate thing going on when I eat at Lo-Lo's. I love eating there then I immediately hate myself for doing it. The waffles slathered in butter are so damn good with my drumstick coated in hot sauce. Man, I could really go for some this weekend. Too bad I'm out of town :-/ To top it off, it's only $20 for two people!
2 ||| Good food weak service.
3 ||| Raven and the entire staff are amazing. The best readings, the best products, and so very helpful in putting together potions or small things to carry to help produce the results you want in your life. The products I purchased were of the FINEST quality.  The reading by Raven was spot on. Imagine a sanctuary of positive energy, light, and acceptance. Just wish I could go more often. But, I got the job Raven predicted I would get. :-)
4 ||| Great place for a simple bagel and cream cheese or yummy lunch sandwich! Great food!
4 ||| I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.
2 ||| Good atmosphere but very bad quality of food.. price is ok but I guess you can't ask for more when it has a poor flavor. I would comeback for the atmosphere but not so much for the food
2 ||| Seems like a typical chain restaurant but not the authentic or tex-mex I was hoping for and the chips were so stale we left it untouched. The food was just as expected, and tasted like everything was just heated in a microwave or something you'd get from the frozen food section. \n\nOur waitor was amazing and even offered info on where we can find what we're looking for since we're new in town.
0 ||| Let me start off by saying that I love Taco Bell! This particular one, however, is at the bottom of my list. I've been back a few times, but it's always bad. The order is always wrong, usually due to the person taking the order.  This last time I got sooo sick after being the only one in my family to eat the chicken. This was my only meal of the day and about 5 hours later, I was stuck in the bathroom for 4 hours. I have no doubts it was Taco Bell as I hadn't eaten anything else that day... I won't be back for sure.
2 ||| I knew my friends & I would be starving after an evening of stress relief at Shooter's World so I Yelped some restaurants nearby. My friends shot down (pun intended.. har har har) Phx Ranch Market and pho joints off of Camelback so I led them to A&J's for some pizza. We missed the first turn because I was on the look out a sign that said \"Angie & Jimmie's Pizza\", but only saw \"PIZZA\" on the window of a shack. We made a u-ey to get a closer look and thinking the parking lots connected with the porno shop, we pulled in too soon. Lo & behold, the parking lots did not connect so we slinkied into the restaurant, hoping no one passing by would recognize our cars parked at the XXX lot. \n\nAnyhow, we took a seat in the dining area and cracked jokes about the lame interior-- empty (clean) pizza boxes stacked against the wall, old arcades in the corner and crappy plastic patio furniture.. Even though I don't drink soda, the free soda fountain was a nice option. It even dispenses horchata! \n\nWe ordered a deluxe large pizza, 26 BBQ wings and an order of fries. The pizza was pretty good, but the folded over crust was kind of weird, wings were meaty (albeit a bit too saucy) and the fries were OK-- nicely seasoned w/ spices, but too greasy and not crispy. \n\nI'd give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up because the service was friendly. $36 pre-tax for 3 people w/ leftovers.
3 ||| This is my 2nd time here at this great revitalized old building. The food is good.\n\nBUT I'm disappointed with the seating manager literally arguing with us on wanting a 4 top when there was literally no line & 6 tables available. He made my hubby so mad he won't ever want to come back. \nWay to go \"Seating Manager\". What happen to pleasing the customer. We saw 4 other 4 tops with only 2 people at it.  You should never argue with a customer. The only table for 2 was crammed at the end of a bench, seating far too close to complete strangers.\n\nThe food was good as before, although I feel there has been serious biscuit  shrinkage. The vegetable egg scramble is delicious and the cinnamon roll was fab!\n\n\nClearly a long line next door, maybe they had similar issue and don't care to take one of the many empty tables.
0 ||| The male bathroom was very dirty. There were crap stains on the back toilet and urine on the floor and foot prints in it. They are not keeping the bathrooms cleans at this QT
4 ||| OMG!  This is the place I go to for Chinese when I visit my family in Vegas. This place is so damn good my mouth waters while writing this.  \nLike I've said before I always judge a Chinese food restaurant based off there Beef Lo Mien, (or Chow Mien, depending on what part of the country you're from)  Which is a soft long fat round noodle, with no vegetables and extra spicy, and cream cheese wantons.\nFor Chinese there customer service is top notch, it's cheap, and there establishments always seem very clean.  This particular location I come to because it's close to my parents house.  They also have fountain soda which is kinda important to me. I hate places that charge by the can, and a lot of Chinese places charge by the can.  That's kind of an immediate turn off.  This place is great!\nYou gotta try them out!
4 ||| If you are looking for evidence that Las Vegas has a soul, this isn't it. The art is vacuous and unchallenging, not even kitschy enough to be ironically good. Mostly just little cubicles of uninspired junk-- poorly executed nudes, \"gothic art\" -- not to be confused with outsider art (or something actually worth seeing), walls lined with flaccid still lifes and hand blown glass figures that appear to be from the indoor swapmeet. Apparently, this place was voted the best art gallery in Vegas by locals, which I suppose says a lot about the locals.
4 ||| Common Market is a hip, cool urban market that makes fantastic sandwiches, sells delicious beer wine and other beverages and offers all kinds of snacks and treats and toys. There are great options for vegetarians (but the chicken salad is a standout if that's your thing). It is one of the very few places in Charlotte that has real authentic character. I love the folks that work there and you can tell that they love working there, too. South End location is awesome too.
4 ||| I'm a Carolina native, born and raised, but you can't get a better hot dog than a Chicago dog.  \n\nMatt's Chicago Dog is serving up authentic ingredient Chicago Dogs to the uptown area is mass quantity!  Quality is supreme and the taste does not disappoint!  \n\nThe staff is friendly and professional and the establishment is always extremely clean, even during busy service.  it's somewhat of a hike for me to do for lunch (from far east Charlotte) but it's certainly worth the time!
0 ||| DO NOT order from here!! This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced!! When I called, the guy didn't even say hello or introduce himself and just kept yelling \"phone number!!\" at me when I tried to ask a question about the service.  When I asked him why the charge was so expensive (because I thought it was 15%), he didn't explain that it was either 6$ or 15%, whichever is more, he just snipped, \"because we don't deliver for free!\"  He was so rude I cancelled my order altogether.  His response \"Good! Bye!\" Wow.....
0 ||| Just because you might not speak English they talk crap about you behind your back. ..nada Buenos!
4 ||| they are less than a minute from home..\nthey have everything basically..\nno complaints :)
0 ||| Terrible service at a recent visit.  It was a Monday around 7ish and my co-worker and I walked in to this place.  We didn't have a reservation as we just flew in to town.  But we saw all the empty tables so we thought were good.  Asked the hostess for a table for 2.  She said the wait time will be about 30 minutes.  And we're like OK no problem.  Then we saw the empty tables outside as well.  So I asked her again if the wait time is still 30 minutes if we are to sit outside?  Surprisingly she still said yes.  So we're out there sitting and after about 30 minutes she comes out and asks \"oh did you want to just eat out here?\".  And we're like - uhmmm yeah???  Unless I was speaking Martian, I swear I remember telling her that some 30 mins earlier.  I decided to skip the steak and instead got the salmon.  My buddy got the steak.  He said the steak was disappointingly dry.  The salmon I had was too greasy.  Very lousy food.  In my opinion I can maybe cut them some slack on the lousy food if their service wasn't terrible.  Why the F would they let us sit outside for 30 mins with 10s of empty tables?  Is it because we're too casual for their \"crowd\"?  Maybe because were not wearing suits?  Or maybe they just don't give a F*** about people who just walk in without a reservation?  This used to be a must-stop for me whenever I go to Madison.  This is now on my must-avoid and do-not-recommend list.
4 ||| Went with a friend for an early lunch before heading back to Raleigh.  \n\nThe business has three levels, with pool tables and a bar on level one, more seating, bars, and larger private spaces on the other two.  \n\nLiked the overall look of the facility and all of the large hdtvs that were \"everywhere.\"\n\nI ordered from the lunch menu - the beer battered chicken tenders with a side order of fries.  Food was quickly served,  Chicken tenders were meaty and the batter was crispy.  The honey mustard dipping sauce was also a good choice.
3 ||| The boy and I spent most of a day here.  In the morning, we and his sister-in-law and 18-month nephew went through the Natural History museum.  The dinosaur exhibit was, of course, the highlight.  I was also impressed by the bird collection.  We were both a little disappointed at the botany display, which was only one smallish room.  I noticed that in a few of the displays, cards indicated that a certain number of artifacts were supposed to be on display, but some had been removed with no explanation or updating to the information.  Or maybe someone stole them and the museum hasn't noticed yet!!\n\nIn terms of natural history museums, I think we have been spoiled for all others by the Field Museum in Chicago.\n\nWe spent the afternoon on the art side, and only managed to get through a couple of the modern art displays before becoming overwhelmed.  There was one film about migration in the modern art room which we both really enjoyed.  I found the art involving the venetian blinds and various types of light bulbs to be fascinating.  We spent the last hour of our time upstairs in the Ancient Egypt exhibit.  Unfortunately, there seemed to be a corporate event happening that afternoon which involved a scavenger hunt; if you think that children's field trips and scavenger hunts are annoying, imagine a whole herd of businessmen and women on a scavenger hunt, and not using their indoor voices, either.\n\nOther than that, the museums were both quite pleasant and not too crowded.  Well worth the student price of $11.
4 ||| Cuisine Malaya offers a great lunch menu.  My first experience was very good.  The Roti with curry sauce was very flavorful.   The Malaysian fried rice with chicken was very good.   It was prepared with a little spice...but I added some wonderful roasted chili pepper sauce to bring it up a little.  simply wonderful.  The service was good and delivery was quick.  No waiting!  Parking was very adequate on both sides of the restaurant.  I will be returning to try other Indo-Asian dishes!!!!
2 ||| Really cool place to have brunch, but the food wasn't much more then par.\nVery cool decorations and the feel is very relaxed and comfortable to hang out on a Sunday morning with friends. When u pay $14 for a buffet, I would think it would be continually stocked, but they couldn't keep up with the demand. If I went on Sunday in the future, I would go before 10:00 so I could get the cheaper price. My wife ordered off the menu and I think I would do the same next time if I didn't do the buffet.  One of the biggest pluses...if you like potatoe casserole, this I'd the place for you...awesome cheese covered potatoes...Yum!\nAll in all... So-So
2 ||| Recommended by fellow yelper, i was still somewhat skeptical in taking Nissan altima in for front brakes but since there was great yelp reviews I would follow though. \n\nCalled and scheduled my appt 8am. Arrived and quickly was taken care of with a short amt of paper work/contact info and history of the cars issue. I was told they would contact me after initial diagnosis and estimated cost. About 2 hours later I was calked and spoke with shop mechanic, nice guy, seemed young but knew his stuff. Quickly informed me of 3 things in order of their priority. 1) front brakes needed replacement (which is why I took it in), 2) oil leak from gasket needed to be replaced with oil change, 3) the burning smell was from plastic bag on exhaust. 4) option: rear brakes have 30% left could be replaced now or wait till next oil change. \nAfter reviewing all the options I took the first 3 and estimated cost was $330 and would be completed by 6pm. All was great and vehicle was finished by 4:30pm. \nBrakes work great, no oil leak, and I'm not Skeptical and will return for future mechanical work! I will also look to bring my pathfinder in for some suspension work. Stay tuned..!
0 ||| Worst service i have ever gotten! They have truly screwed me over. Switching lines all wrong, once I got Verizon to fix it... The attorney sends me a letter saying I owe $400. DO NOT GO THERE!!!... also- the guy helping me named Jose, had no idea what he was doing and had the worst customer service and had no remorse for how much he screwed up my account! They don't even deserve one star.
4 ||| I was so in the mood for a really good cheeseburger today, so I had to go ahead and have one.  This was my day off, but unfortunately not for my friends, relatives or my husband.  Well, maybe fortunately 'cos sometimes I do like to go out for lunch by myself.\n\nAnyway, that cheeseburger craving need satisfying and fast!  And nothing from McD's or BK would do either!  I wanted a real burger!  And let me tell you, they have great burgers here!  And the choices of cheese here!  American, Swiss, Provolone, Colby, Jack, Gouda, or Mozzerella!  I went for the Gouda on mine.  They even have sauces, which I didn't try, including an apricot salsa for your burger.\n\nThe only drawback is the size of their burgers  These bad boys are nine ounces, more than half a pound!  If I'm with a friend, I'll share my burger, but not today!  That's okay.  I saved my fries for my husband Rick.  I think my tummy is going to be digesting that burger until Christmas!
3 ||| Sure the idea of bbq from a chain restaurant is a turn-off but Famous Dave's really is a good place.  The ribs are good the sauce is good, the brisket is good. $3 margaritas every day.  Tonight our ribs were just a little tough and our server could have done a touch better, but we are fans and always like our dinner here.
3 ||| Welp Yelp ! This was an ok tasting Pizza but Ive had better. Maybe since Im from up North I really know what a good New York tasting Pizza taste like so maybe Im being a little harsh. The atmosphere was cool and Im not too excited on returning but its worth a try at the least.
0 ||| We have been there many times I from 8pm to 11 pm. This is the worst I have ever seen for a restaurant ( Sonic ). SLOW, the girl at the window needed change and  the guy was busy on his iPhone  looked at her like don't bother me. Took for ever to get 2  Bergers. The owner should take a good look at who is working for him. If this is the best he can do he better look at himself SAD.
0 ||| For some reason, sushi brings out the snob in Americans. Unfortunately, it has been less of an opportunity to dine on high quality uncooked seafood, and more of a showcasing of who can look trendiest or appear to have the best taste.\n\nWhen I'm done making fun of newbies who prefer California rolls, and tired of gaudy decorations, I need a place that gets down to business. A place where you can chill out and and stuff some salmon in peace.\n\nTokyo Lobby is that place.\n\nThe traditional rolls are always tasty, and I don't recall any individual item being more than about $10. What really shines here are the specialty rolls. I tried the 'Orgasm' and the flavor blew my mind. I really wanted the Sex on the Beach, but to my dismay the chef was out of the bananas for the tempura. Curses, but you knew I'd be back anyway!\n\nMy only problem is that I feel the eel sauce is too sweet...reminded me of an allspice flavor as opposed to the more savory sauces I've sampled elsewhere. Also, the seating is a bit crowded and they're closed on Sunday! That alone has lost them several visits from me. STILL WORTH IT.\n\nNext time you're on Bell Road craving sushi, visit Tokyo Lobby and get a quality product without seeing swarms of snobs. You'll thank me later.
4 ||| Put some time into learning how to shop this store and you will be greatly rewarded.  Excellent values all over the place, and things you can't find anywhere else.  I especially like the produce department.  \n\nLotus is one of only 4 stores I always have to shop when I visit the strip.
0 ||| I have been coming to this Lens Crafters for years and was really disappointed today. There is a lack in customer service and the way I was treated when inquiring about retrieving my prescription after I had my eye exam there before a change from Maricopa county's insurance. It was almost like they didn't want to help me/give me my prescription because they weren't going to be making the sale with my insurance now changed and no longer accepted there ... even though I had my eye exam there before the changes, and I had called in advance to see if i could go in to retrieve my prescription to take elsewhere and they told me yes
4 ||| I love the spumoni ice cream.  tiramisu is good too.\n\nordered also the \ntortellini soup---it's ok\n\ngoat cheese salad ---decent\n\nthe daily special salmon stuffed crab is really good.
0 ||| The owner is a total b!tch.. She ordered appetizers for our large group of 17 people (at no ones request mind you) and tacked on another $400 to our bill. We were blown away.. The servers were great but we've never had a more unprofessional experience at a restaurant!!
0 ||| Terrible experience at amp performance. I spent $3,000.00 on performance parts included was a red optima battery for a $169.00 that went dead and wouldn't hold a charge after 18 months I went into there shop and was treated terrible. They started out giving me a hard time and it escalated when Tom  came in. He went into a rage and got physical to the point I called 911. The police arrived and really helped me to get him to do something. They made him send it to copper state batteries for review. Scary Very scary for anyone doing business with them What would happen with a major issue and not just a $169.00 battery .Terrible !
0 ||| the food was standard and okay. the service was mediocre. but what i really want to talk about is the menu.\n\nfirst, the entertainment book coupon is only good for about five dinner-menu items. there isn't even an alfredo option. so that was limiting and disappointing.\n\nnext, the regular menu also includes a catering menu, and there are far more enticing options on that menu. but they won't make any of them unless you are buying in large quantities. if someone could explain that logic to me, it would be helpful.\n\nwith so few choices available, i don't really see a reason to go back.
2 ||| Last year I gave it 5 stars, this year, 3.  The chef has just gotten lazy - they have gone from a full menu full of fabulous choices to 2 set menus - a 3 Course at $65 (granted, selections within this, but nothing enticed at all...) and a 7 course, all if which sounded delicious, for $125.  Since we are not allowed foie gras in California, I'm on a mission on my yearly visit to Wisconsin...  The usual plan is to sit at the bar and let the excellent and knowledgeable bartenders guide us through wine, drinks and food for dinner 2 nights in a row at L'Etoile, as their fish selections were varied and always wonderful.  Usually only one incredible foie gras starter, but the helpful Bartenders would have a word and the chef would create something new, different and exciting for our return the next night to accompany one of the other fish dishes we were dying to try...  That is no longer possible with this set menu.  I'm normally all for Prix fix, IF you have a choice of that or the usual menu.  2 Set Menus only?  Not happy, and neither are some of the other regulars we met last night.  \n\nSo, onto the menu which granted, we shared, but still incredibly puny portions.  Montauk Grilled Scallops - was one of the teensiest scallop singular I have ever seen sliced into 4 slivers.  Had to put on reading glasses to find its accompaniments and impossible to experience all together.  Foie gras 2 ways and all to myself as husband knows better... - one teensy pear \"cracker\" with buttery heaven on it - would have killed for a bowl of this, a 1\" seared piece in a duck reduction that was very interesting in a good way... Would have killed for more than 3 little bites of this too.  I was able to accompany with a lovely glass of Sauternes, but the foie was gone well before the wine.  Lobster was small but yummy.  Lamb \"Rack\" - ha... Not memorable.  Eye of Rib - again, meh.  Hooks 12 year cheddar with apple - I missed the usual calcium lactate crystals I love to find in the Hooks 12 year, so this was a letdown.  Pumpkin cheesecake was a hit.  Small, but yummy.  Scott,  the bartender, is amazing and would love to have him guide me through wine and drink menus always.  Sad as I loved this place, our yearly 2 nights in a row food feast \"pilgrimage,\" but we're looking elsewhere for tonight.  Highly recommend sitting at the bar though, totally different experience than the tables and you meet amazing people who know their food.  Met the Pleasant Ridge cheese maker last night, one of my favs.  So, after a $125 7 course menu which granted, we split, hit the Tornado and split a $9 beef tenderloin sandwich, which was incredibly satisfying.  Last night reminded me of our dinner at El Bulli, when my husband had to stop for an Iberico and cheese sandwich after 37 courses!  We really aren't that big of eaters, usually split a starter and an entree, but another amusing end to a food feast evening ;-)  L'Etoile, please go back to giving us choices!
2 ||| Not a terrible dining experience, but certainly not an upper tier establishment.
4 ||| I stayed here for about a week while waiting for my new place to be ready to move into, and I must say, it was a nice experience.\nRecently I've been staying in many inexpensive hotels, and this one was definitely a cut above the rest.\nThe room was clean, had WIFI, the basics to be able to make a meal, and had decent towels.\nThe hotel is also conveniently located for shopping, food, and access to the highway.\nThere is a $25 fee/night for pets which I thought should have been $25 per stay.
0 ||| Progressive insurance does not pay their claims.  I was rear ended by a Progressive insured driver.  I was told by a Progressive agent to get an estimate - which they OK'd - took the car in for the repair when they told me to and then refused to pay.  They are no better than the other company that advertises \"We keep you legal for less.\"  What that means is that you pay the low premiums and they refuse to pay claims!  They are not even within the Insurance Consortium.  Beware!
0 ||| I'm a big tiki culture fan. Walking in side I got stoked the place looks like a tiki bar. I approached the bar asked for my favorite tiki drink the \"painkiller\" the bar keep didn't know what it was. I asked for a drink menu.  No drink menu. I asked if he could make a tiki drink. His reply was baffling \"we're a dive bar bro\" ok. So basically it's a tiki bar that serves beer. Weird right.  If you have the theme why not make the drinks? Just saying.
1 ||| We have been to this place couple times. My wife felt is was a great place for a massage and other treatments. Unfortunately, I had the worst massage ever. This was a young man who was so weak I could not even feel barely any pressure..I said please a little harder..It as like a lite rub on oil on my back... The ..owner did email me and said it was his first day...but he had NFL football players that raved about him...but we had 3 massages & not inexpensive either. The owner did offer a $25 coupon for the next time...I may go back...but doubt it. Make sure you ask for a \"seasoned\" masseist
0 ||| Used this pharmacy on two occasions for my sons medicines since it is 24 hours . The first time they said it would be ready in 20 , went back 30 mins later and they hadnt even started my order !! Second time same thing happened except they said they didnt have the stuff to make it there and sent us to the Walgreens on 107 ave and mcdowell and when we got there the lady said I dont know why they sent you here I cant make this!! Went back to other walgreens and demanded to speak to manager and what do you know he got the pharmacist to make it he was just to lazy to make it the first time!! Never again will I use any Walgreens locations , they lost a loyal customer!!
0 ||| I don't know folks. I see a lot of good reviews of this place here on Yelp but my experience at this restaurant was just awful! This is your typical mom and pop place. Normally these types of places are great. Not so with this one. We walked in and were seated promptly. We had a couple of questions about the menu and our food server could not answer any of them. One of the questions was \"do you have margaritas\"? She was so clueless she didn't even know if they served margaritas or not!!! Every question we asked she kept having to run into the kitchen to have answered. Finally an older lady had to come out and help her. The older lady told us our food server had only been there a week. You're there a week and don't know what type of drinks you serve among other things? The items we ordered were guacamole cheese crisp, shredded beef burrito enchilada style (red sauce) and machaca burrito with green sauce. The cheese crisp was cold and the tortilla they used had the consistency of pop tarts. Hard, greasy, horrible. It was the worst cheese crisp I've ever had. The shredded beef burrito was only filled about a quarter of the way and the beef was extremely dry and flavorless.  It makes me nauseous thinking about it it was that bad.  The machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices. Not your typical machaca. We thought we were given an incorrect order but the food server advised us this is how they make their machaca. It is dried then ground. I would not visit here again. I've eaten at better Taco Bells.   Do not eat at this restaurant.
4 ||| This is a typical Sweet Tomatoes location. Not my favorite around town, but they have pretty fast and friendly service. The food line is well-maintained, which is important for a buffet. They cleared plates pretty quickly and the service was friendly. \n\nThey have all the typical salad and soup selections that you come to expect at Sweet Tomatoes. They were especially busy on the day we came here for a local fundraiser and they were really able to keep up with the barrage of people that all came in at the same time and were very accommodating. \n\nDefinitely a good option in the Henderson as far as chain restaurants go.
4 ||| This might not be the right one or this shows a wrong address because the one I went to was at 2439 South Valley View in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nWhen we went to Vegas for a wedding, I had to try this place because some friends of mine said  they're fried rice comes really close to Shirley's back on Guam which we all loved. And in my opinion...it was F&*KIN' GOOD! So good that the boyfriend and I went back 2 days later and ordered it again. Keep in mind that this is a simple island food establishment. So there are no frills and just damn good food. Obviously, I had the combo fried rice which had spam, portuguese sausage and char-sui (chinese BBQ pork). YUM. They have a huge menu so next time I'll definitely try something else.
4 ||| This place proves that the local sports bars are the best. \n\nTop Three Reasons You're Going to LOVE This Place:\n\n1. The energy in here is CRAZY!!! Everyone from the regulars to first timers are cheering and celebrating throughout the whole bar. First time? Don't worry the amazingly helpful staff will make you feel right at home. \n\n2. There are TV's everywhere!!!! They line the walls and you can watch any games you want...if there's a game playing it's going to be on here. Just come prepared to cheer on your favorite team! And if you are a die hard fan, they have dedicated fan rooms...GO STEELERS!!! \n\n3. Great drink and food specials!!! There are tons of beers on tap and on special and a great variety on the menu. My friends and I helped ourselves to some wings and fries and we were not disappointed. \n\n\nIf you haven't been here you are definitely missing out! So grab your favorite jersey and head on over to Steamers!!!
0 ||| This dealer has no intention of making good on discounts offered.  I clearly received an email offer for $50 to be used AS CASH on ANY repair, they would not let me use it to repair my key fob which broke during normal use, just like yours will someday as they don't make them to last, they know they will break, it's a well documented problem.
4 ||| I hadn't eaten here for quite a while, but I'm glad I did! The environment is louder but that's because it's mixed with restaurant and bar. The service is great and friendly. The portion sizes were large & plenty. Choices, choices, choices too....salad, pasta, pizza....so many choices in each type of food. To top it off...awesome pizza!!! Why did I stay away so long???? Be back very soon!
4 ||| Small restaurant but food is amazing. This was our second time here. The first time we had lunch and they offer lunch specials and take out. Tonight we went for dinner and it was quiet only two other tables had customers, maybe because it was late. The service is quick and excellent just like the food, we will continue to stop in every time we are in town.
0 ||| Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!
4 ||| We tried this place do to my looking up a place to eat while we were in the area, having our staycation at the Arizona Grand Resort\nHong Kong has to be the best Chinese Buffet I've ever been and I have eaten plenty. Everything was delicious.  We went for dinner so it was 15 and change for adults and our kids were 10 basically.   \n\nThe sushi bar was awesome. Instead of having a chef put out 5 or so different kinds of typical sushi. There is a chef making sushi to order. the menu to order off of is pretty extensive. \n\nMy kids and had quite a few crab legs. The crab legs were also not your typical buffet grade. They were cooked perfectly and the meat was easy to remove and there was a lot of it.\n\nwe didn't try the Mongolian BBq but, we be back.
0 ||| They were out pepperoni pizza by the slice so I had to get a more expensive one. The salad I get had rotten slimy lettuce so I had to take it back for another one. The second one also had rotten lettuce...third times the charm. And the cherry in top, the Sierra mist taste like fizz water. This meal cost me almost $10. Won't be going back.
1 ||| I feel guilty that I have never reviewed Cabo Fish Taco before because it is my favorite place! I love this place and I always take people here when they come to visit. My favorites are the BBQ mahi tacos, lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the mahi maui burrito but you really can't go wrong here. My fiance loves the rasta pasta. The guacamole is also delicious. The only thing that is sometimes a downside to this place is that it can get really loud in the restaurant which makes it hard to talk at dinner. Also, since it is so tasty, sometimes you have to wait awhile for a table. But it is SO worth it!
2 ||| I just accepted a beautiful ring from Hennes. I have had nothing but compliments and I must say that the ring was beautiful. Unfortunately within 4 days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing. I'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of. But my new fianc\u00e9 is very upset by this.
0 ||| I took my dog here to be boarded.  He came home unhappy, but I didn't think much of it (maybe he just missed us).   I used them a second time to groom my dog.  This is where the problem arose.  When I went to pick up my dog, they gave me someone elses pet.  Even though this was a chocolate lab (like mine), it was obviously not my dog.  Then they argued with me saying he was he only chocolate lab they had.  Well....one hour later and 3 other labs (I thought mine was the only one!)...they finally found my dog.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you hate your dog and want to trade him in for another model.
4 ||| This is one of those places you desperately want to love... the decor is amazing, some strange, psychedelic mixture of saloon meets slightly-cheesy italian... the waitstaff are a bunch of sweethearts, mostly old ladies...and it's been here for something like 60 years, pumping out pizzas and pasta and texas toa-er-garlic bread. \n\nBut you can't really, because its pretty pricey-- and the food is bad. The combination kills it for you. Your pizza comes out, at a whopping $12 for a smallish two topping, and the crust is Elio's, or something, a poured batter-like pie shell texture crust. The sauce is hardly there, and the cheese is so plasticized, it stretches for feet. Your \"greek salad\" is $6 and is half a head of iceburg with oddly-flavored diced beets, a small sprinkling of feta, two tomato quarters, and two small olives. \n\nI've given it two tries, maybe the third will be different... but I get the feeling the recipes and style of cooking happening here haven't changed in 20 years, and are unlikely to in the near future.
4 ||| This restaurant is in my \"hood\" and I had heard good things about the pizza muffins so I had to give it a try. \n\nIt was busy on a Friday night but we only waiting about 10 mins for our table.  The servers were on top of things as far as I could see.  Our server was at out table in two seconds taking drink orders.  Since it was our first time there I wanted to look over the menu.  He gave us sufficient time and then he was back, took our order, and salad and breadsticks for my daughter arrived in about 5 mins.  The pizza muffins were right behind........ahhhh....these are like crack to me.  I'm instantly addicted!  Little wheels of pizza dough with chesse and ham, fresh and hot and gooey.  YUM!!!!  I should have just made a meal off the pizza muffins but I had to try the pizza.  My daughter had a Jr. Pizza with her favorite topping, black olives.  She gave it a big thumbs up.\nI tried one with sausage, salami and mushrooms.  The dough was soft, cooked to perfection and has a nice flavor.  The toppings were generous.  It was good and I took the rest home.  \n\nIt seems as thought everyone there were regulars, locals.  The service was fast and friendly. I thought the prices were very resonable. When we were ready to leave my daughter needed a to go cup for the rest of her drink.  Our server kindly obliged and brought her a to go cup.....filled with more of her drink!  We will be back!  I'm sure I will be craving pizza muffins very soon!!
0 ||| We don't have Cracker Barrell in CA so we always stop in for some country cookin' while visiting AZ.  Today we learned they changed the menu and removed some of our favorite items.  They added a few menu items that do not compliment their \"country comfort food\" theme.  I guess their executives don't know who their customers are or why people choose their restaurants.
3 ||| I found myself wandering the aisles of Target yesterday to kill some time and left with many things I probably did not really need as usual.\n\nI like the layout of this store. It is easy to navigate and find what I need (or don't need) quickly. I ended up with two new CD's yesterday and I found them at great prices. I also found some really great Essie nail products that I haven't been able to find anywhere else, Target saves the day once again. I also shopped the dish detergent section, the bottled water section and randomly ended up with some mac and cheese. Target is not a good place to kill time, you will end up buying many random things - fair warning.\n\nI do find the clothes at this particular location to be a little bit lacking. The selection is very limited and a lot of sizes seem to be gone when I am looking through them. I will be back to Target many times. Hopefully next time with a clear direction of what I need but rest assured even if you don't need it Target has got it.
4 ||| Stayed here this past week on business travel. One of the reason this hotel was selected because of the outstanding gym and work out area. Guess what? Gym was closed daily during peek hours to allow Buffalo Bills  football teamwork to work out. Never the less we were still charged the $25.00 resort fee to cover the use of the gym. I complained at check out and got an Oh Well attitude from the front desk clerk along with a laugh. Front desk at check-in seemed to be either new or clueless not what you would expect from a 4 Star resort.\nBuffy in the restaurant was a great waitress, maybe you should move her to the front desk for a better customer experience.
0 ||| Please do NOT go to this place for anything. The staff is a very sad and angry. The staff was very confused walking around the business aimlessly not trying to help or guide anyone around. First the person who was performing the smog test didn't know were to find the vin number didn't smile or even acknowledge that he was suppose to be helping us just walked right passed us while we wondered if him or one of the 3 other people standing around are going to help us. Then The manager came out and tryed to help but got frustrated while trying to smog my vehicle which is understandable because its an old car however he exploded a list of vulgar language, yelling and stomping like a small child because the car was having a hard time getting a read. Needless to say im very disappointed. Please go else were if you want quality work. I support small businesses but never again will I even walk in that place.
4 ||| Great pizza and quality live music. Two of my family members are vegan and ordered the meatless sausage and meatball sandwiches. I had a bite of both and they were delicious. The owner recommended her original handmade vegan cheesecake. It was excellent. It wasn't on the menu yet so you may have to ask for it.
1 ||| Used to love this place! Tonight the food was bland lacking flavor and the servers seemed to be in such a hurry just to rush you out the door. Had the tenderfoot Cajun style which was just average for the price. The sides tastes like they were straight out of a buffet! Highlight of the meal was the apple pie.
4 ||| Delicious gourmet food, wonderful location, pleasant service and never a wait!  This is the place to go to get some delicious Chris Bianco pizza!!  \n\nWe've been here many times, so we've tried several of the pizzas, sandwiches and salads.  Everything is excellent - heavy gourmet flavor (without creating heavy food), fresh ingredients (like locally-sourced goat cheese), delicious crusts/breads...  My husband once brought home a loaf of bread and a jar of fig jam from here, and it was also delectable!\n\nThe service is really warm and the staff is knowledgeable.  The place is adorable, with a country chic decor and the nooks and crannies of a cool older building.  It's conveniently located right next to Lux coffee shop.  \n\nI should note that we've also been to another Bianco restaurant and the food and service weren't nearly as good.  This is definitely my go-to Bianco!
4 ||| Best of the Souper Salads in the valley. Gotta get dat taco bar, son! There's plenty of buffet places but they're all so expensive I couldn't eat my moneys worth if I tried. You understand what I'm saying? I love soup. There's salad. Stay black NBC. Right, Gina Marooney?
3 ||| The food has gotten better over the years, but the service remains one of the rudest in the city. For some reason, the people who work here could care less about their customers, and it shows. The food is decent, but there are other just as solid choices when it comes to Asian food not just in Pittsburgh, but in Squirrel Hill as well.
2 ||| I've been to this place a couple of times, mainly for team lunches, so I thought I'd review it this time.  When you walk in, you get that classy Asian vibe.   It's fairly upscale looking.  But the first thing I noticed was how few Chinese people there are.  I think I was the only one.  \n\nWe had the chicken lettuce wrap for the appetizer. The chicken was not as tender as some other lettuce wraps I've had, and the soysauce may have overpowered the taste of the chicken.  But it was edible.  I tried one of the lunch bowls: pepper steak.  It said it should by spicy, but I couldn't feel the spice.  The beef was cooked well, but they ODed on the sauce making it too salty.  \n\nI thought the dessert shooters were really cute.  It's a good portion for those who want to have some desserts but not overstuff ourselves after a heavy main course.  The tiramisu shooter isn't as good.  But then it's not expected to have a tiramisu flavor in a Chinese oriented place.  It tastes more like a tiramisu cake instead of the traditional soft and creamy tiramisu I'm used to at an Italian restaurant.\n\nWhat I do like about the restaurant is the different tea flavors you can choose from.  And they bring it out for you in a traditional Chinese/Japanese like teapot to set the Asian mood.  It's a good alternative for a tea house. \n\nPf Chang's is good to have food for the people who like the Chinese-American fusion.  It may be a good place to start if you're scared of \"real\" Chinese food.  It's not a good place for authentic Chinese food.  And the price is more than I would pay for average tasting lunch.
0 ||| We brought boyfriends car here based on a recommendation from a friend. Boyfriend knew immediately to check Yelp and all of the reviews are amazing. \n\nThey were so communicative it was insane. We have brought his car other places and it would take days to get a response. These guys clearly pride themselves on communication and customer service. \n\nWe dropped the car off after hours and he had it back the next day after a quick call and explanation. These guys want to give you the best deal possible. They had some coupons they offered which helped us out (even if just a bit).\n\nIf you think their service is a little more expensive, its worth it!!! Having taken the car other places and not had service like this, we would take both of our cars back here and pay far more than any other place.
1 ||| Tried the location at Hilldale awhile ago, way better than this place. Came in on a Sunday for brunch, started off ordering a bloody mary which had to be made with their garlic infused tequila because they were out of vodka (what?). The menu described the $8 drink as garnished with lots of toppings, when I got it, it had a lemon and lime. I took one sip and discovered tequila is not meant for bloodies, so I asked for a coke in return. We were told we wouldn't be charged for the bloody, but once the check came and the $8 for it was still included, our server told us it couldn't be removed from the bill because it had been made, but to take it off of his tip (again, what?).\n\nFood was decent, but my order was messed up and I was already feeling too needy to have it sent back. Also a bit pricey - chips and salsa aren't included with meals. I would not go back to this location.
0 ||| Don't really like to post bad reviews but I have been here several times and I really want to like it,  unfortunately,  the bartender george is one of the worst people I have encountered in the service industry.  If u are reading this George,  its not hard to pretend to tolerate people, try to be somewhat attentive to paying customers instead of displaying your shitty attitude. The woman...dont know her name is very sweet and good behind the bar.  Unfortunately,  when George is there,  u have to beg for a drink,  menu,  anything really because he can't be bothered. I will continue to go to this bar as it in my hood I just wish the servers were better.
4 ||| If you have a sense of humor, if you love frozen cosmopolitans or if you're just looking for a fun, casual place to get your grub on, Harris Grill is where it's at. I recommend the Henny Penny, but be adventurous; they are always changing their menu to incorporate a plethora of ingredients, so you're bound to find something you love. Plus, they've got a sweet outdoor patio for the warmer days. \n\nMake sure to spend some time with the menu. It's a riot. Brilliant!
3 ||| Food was very good and it came out quickly.  Only issue was the waitress, had to ask for two menus, then we ordered two beers but only got one, then getting enough to go boxes was challenging.
4 ||| Jasmine was extremely helpful at checkin.  She was very accomodating and friendly.  However when I called the next day to inquire if this hotel had room service, I was told flatly, \"no.\" by a woman at the desk. Room service is a must for me when I'm traveling, so a hotel that doesn't have it alone took off several stars off this review.  Because of this, I had to get in the car and drive out to get a steak dinner, then brought it back to the hotel only to see they have forgotten utensils.  The ones the front desk provided were plastic, and did not cut my steak.  They don't have silverware at this property, either. The hotel is dark and needs an update.  Won't be staying here again. The tactless woman at the front desk earned it 2 stars.  Thank you to Jasmine for her manners and hospitality, however.  If I could, I would yelp her and give her 5 stars.
3 ||| I was in desperate need of an oil change, so I headed here quickly during my lunch hoping to get it done fast. Service was efficient and they helped me as soon as I arrived. I only waited about 15 minutes for everything and I was relatively happy with the service.  A little more expensive than other places I have seen and they almost always try to sell me a new air filter, etc. At least they take no for an answer and don't push the sales pitch too much, which I appreciate. \n\nOverall, I had an A-Ok experience.
2 ||| A solid little cafeteria on the 10th floor of City hall. The good news is it's open to the public, and it's cheap. If you're looking for a decent little bite to eat downtown, and looking to keep prices low, this is as good as any fast food joint in the city. \n\nThe food mostly consists of you'd expect to find inside a cafeteria. Burgers and sandwiches make up most of what I noticed on the menu. I went in pretty early and decided to go with a breakfast burrito. It was far from the best I'd ever had, but for the low price of just $3.50, I can't complain. \n\nWhat I will complain about is that service was pretty slow. As a small line started to form, none of the employees came over to help the one who was taking orders and cooking. They also charge a convenience fee with credit cards. It's only 24 cents, but I didn't see the sign until after I handed the cashier the card, and she charged me. Not to sound cheap, but if it had been posted in a spot before the register, I would've used cash.
3 ||| Amazing. Try the 2 slice and drink meat special on Fridays
0 ||| I reserved one of their tower rooms with a king bed in LATE DECEMBER for January 18th, and 19th. They charged my card a $75.00 deposit (not an authorization, a charge, which I paid before my visit). I called a week before to confirm, which they cheerfully did. I was arriving late in the evening, so, I called on the way too, just to make sure they had late check in, I was assured that this wasn't a problem. When I arrived, I found THEY GAVE MY ROOM AWAY.  That's right. I was dumbfounded, since I had already in part paid for it weeks ago. They explained \"We don't reserve beds sir, just rooms, and we can get you 2 queens instead of a king...\" The total nonsense way they pitched this to me sounded moronic, as if they \"move beds around\" When I didn't accept this, the front desk became argumentative, and engaged in straw man arguments, twisting words, and accusing me of using the word \"you\" in the context of the guy helping me, who kept claiming \"Sir I didn't do this, so don't say you!...\" and then stated I was \"accusing him of charging my card\" of course \"you\" means palace station you moron. The manager was equally unhelpful, she refused to even give me her name. \n\nThis place values only your money, they have no eye on repeat business, and do not understand the concept of customer service, or meeting a minimum commitment. I am so glad that at 1:30am I found rooms at the MGM Grand, who actually apologized for my bad Vegas experience, and cut me a deal on a very nice room, that they really didn't have to.\n\nStay elsewhere.
4 ||| This place was awesome!! Amazing food & prices were cheap as well, happy hour choices were good too!
0 ||| **Beware** RIP OFF!! do not attemp!!  I went here years back multiple times until they tried to completely rip me off and up charge me over $1100 for stuff that wasn't even wrong or broken on my truck.. I decided to go back because of this new Groupon.. BIG MISTAKE!... after the Groupon they quoted me over $150 bucks than the price that Brakes Plus quoted me, and that was without any kind of Groupon or discount!!
3 ||| Not the newest or greatest or cheapest. But if your in the mood for roller skating, it's there.
4 ||| 04/08 Update - My wife ordered the mezzaluna pasta this time and I ordered the evening's special pasta - wild musroom ravioli.  Both were excellent.  We also shared the evening's special salad - arugula and fennel with a blood orange and lemon dressing.  \n\nThis restaurant is very much a family affair with the wife serving as maitre d, the husband reciting the night's specials and the son serving as our waiter.  We shared a Caesar salad that was disappointing, but our pasta entrees saved the evening.  Ms. Westie ordered ravioli do zucca al burro e salvia  -   homemade ravioli stuffed with roasted butternut squash, topped with brown butter and sage.  I ordered the mezzaluna di vitello con Porcini - homemade half moon pasta filled with veal, served with peas, prosciutto and porcini mushrooms in a light cream sauce. Both pasta dishes were bursting with flavor and I rated mine as the best entre of the trip. We used a coupon for 50% off a second entre that I located on the Las Vegas Review Journal's (RJ) website
3 ||| Pho is a challenge in this city. I have not found a really good place yet, but Pho Saigon 8 can make the cut of being decent.\n\nThe taste of the broth is a lot better than all the other pho restaurants in the city, as it wasn't as oily. The only bad part is that there was MSG in there, and a lot of it! I got really thirsty afterwards, and I got a headache! Ehh....I would have given it 5, but the taste just got to me afterwards...In addition, the service was just awful after our food came. Our drinks and food came right away, but when it was refill time....not a soul came by to visit! We even asked for refills when we did find someone, but we waited too long and decided to leave... BOO!\n\nIf I were to choose a place for pho, this would be it (as I have no other choice...)
2 ||| Very good experience overall.  Fast, friendly service.  Knowledgeable order taker and smoothie was good.\n\nKeeping it from a 5 star was the lack of a clear choice of a low carb or low sugar smoothie - menu nutritionals are confusing.
2 ||| Came back for the holidays, and stopped by Beto's.  The pizza hasn't changed a bit, and it remains in my top three in the town.  \n\nHowever, can someone please teach the kids working there how to keep up an establishment?  Not once did I see someone clean tables or remove the number tags from the table.  We had to clean our own table.  The floor was littered with straw wrappers and napkins, especially under our table.  The bathroom was in shambles and my friend mentioned that the ladies room was out of tp.  \n\nTherefore--three stars, with the pizza saving the review from total damnation.
3 ||| Okay a local favorite for many years. if anybody's ever eaten at the omelette house they know how good the food is. If you haven't eaten at the omelette house what a shame you missed out all these years. \n\nThey serve breakfast & lunch with lots of delicious omelettes, good sandwiches and of course the banana nut bread and the pumpkin bread is worthy of going just for that. The names for the different omelettes are pretty funny\n\nIt's tucked in the back of a shopping center. From the looks of the exterior you would never dream of all the delicious things behind the doors. Family owned and operated it has kind of a grandma's kitchen feel with wood d\u00e9cor and pictures of the family on the walls as you walk in the door.very busy around lunch time so come early. Lots of seating and they get you through during lunch pretty quick, it's just busy.\n\nI had the Californian omelette and it had sausage avocado and Jack cheese the home cut potatoes are thin cut like chips with seasoning. My wife had a omelette with peppers and cheddar make sure you order the baby omelette unless you're extremely hungry the omelettes are big! \n\nGreat for breakfast
0 ||| This is a weird complaint, but I absolutely hate when I can taste dirty tap water in food. Everything I had from this Taco Bell had a lovely City of Mesa aftertaste.
0 ||| Late afternoon dinner at the Palm... I wanted to leave when we were not received for about 10 minutes, but we gave them some time to realize there were customers up front. After someone in the kitchen finally noticed us, we were seated at a table, with no menus... Then, our waiter introduced himself, took away extra silverware, and gave us no menus. We asked... Should we get out own menus? He said he would get us some. He then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view. Since the restaurant was almost completely empty, it looked like we were interrupting a break. After several minutes of chit-chat, the waiter finally delivered some menus (how hard is that?). Perusing the menu, it was clear the Palm doesn't believe in meals, which I guess is because meals are... gauche. You can order a steak for $45, but you won't get a salad or a side unless you buy a separate $8 plate of veggies or $8 salad. I just couldn't believe a 9 oz. piece of meat would be worth that much (plus, I'd rather a 6 oz. filet). So, we ordered the Veal and Chicken Parm. (~$35), which do not come with any noodles unless you pay $4 extra (thus bringing the Parms. up to ~$40). I also ordered a coffee, which was just OK, and asked for a bread basket, which was room temperature and less enjoyable than the Mimi's bread basket. On the plus side, the entrees were excellent, and had there been half as much Chicken Parm., a vegetable, and some well-prepared noodles or potatoes, I wouldn't have felt so ripped off. As is, two chicken breasts was way too much chicken and too little fine dining. In addition, the lighting in the restaurant was not very romantic/intimate, and there was a noticeable lack of ambiance. We managed to escape from the restaurant for $110 total (no salads, no desserts, no alcohol), for a meal that was less enjoyable than many $60 meals ($30 per person) we've enjoyed at other restaurants (with at least 1 salad, 1 dessert, and 1 glass of wine). If someone else had been paying the bill, I had ordered the lacking sides, and I had never seen the price, I may have had a better experience, but the service and ambiance still were nothing to write home about. (Hi, Mom!)
4 ||| This place is amazing. You wouldn't even know it's there when you are driving by. It's in a very unassuming location, tucked back in the corner of a little strip mall. It's very small, but has huge charm. Their Pad Thai is so good. Also, though it seems like an Asian restaurant,  they also serve Italian food.  Best chicken marsala I have ever had. And they have a great happy hour. Try the potstickers, they are to die for.
0 ||| Used to be my favorite restaurant until today I found a hair in my steak I paid big bucks for low hygiene.
0 ||| This place was so disappointing.  Maybe they are known for their sushi, but since we were there for noodles, we didn't order sushi.  Unfortunately, their udon dish that they used to have in a broth was no longer on the menu.  Our server barely spoke english so we had a language barrier and she kept insisting we order their udon dish that was stir fried.  Instead I ordered their garlic chicken dish with rice.  The chicken was OLD and you could tell it had been flash fried quite a few times.  It was rough and wouldn't even tear apart when I was trying to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I couldn't even finish my dish.  The husband had these pork cutlets that he said was way too sweet and extremely dry.  He, too, had a hard time cutting his pork.  We ordered our son the udon stir fry and he ate about 4 bites and said he was \"full\".  So about $50 later, we left hungry and irritated and swearing we'd never come back here again.  So sad.
3 ||| Thomas Road & I17.  Fresh Remodel.  The Unbelievably Cool Guy in the Superbowl Video Loop running December through May finally got his volume turned down. \n\nYou know what you get when you eat at Dennys.  Moon over My Hammy, the Grand Slam, etc. decently priced, meal and drink about $10. \n\nMom likes it here a lot.  Especially the chicken noodle soup.  We eat here occasionally.  It was nice to walk in and see fresh upholstery on the seating, new carpet, and some new paint.  There were even actual pictures of notable Central Phoenix architecture hung on the wall alongside the burger and Pancake Puppy pictures.  Most hotels can't even get local pictures on their walls.  I thought that was very good.  \n\nService at this Denny's is variable.  Some meals are worth actually doubling the tax for a tip.  Other tips are for table consultation.  \n\nThis Denny's is at the crossroad of Interstate 17 and U.S. 60.  Lots of people stop in.  So of course, lots of guys want to leave their marks in the men's room.  Not missed the bulls-eye kind of marks, but 'hood, homey, personal tags and of course, the occasional misled Supremacist swastica.  Phoenix is a culturally diverse place.  Everyone seems to want to publicly express theirs.  However, not much poetry or humor here.  I cannot vouch for the Ladies Room.  This should not put off the intrepid Denny's Yelp*er or diner.  The facilities are generally clean, the paper supplies stocked, and soap is in the dispenser.  Regular mopping, cleaning, and stocking rounds are made.      \n\nSpeaking of misled supremacists, I know Denny's reputedly had a corporate culture ignoring some populations within our United States of humanity.  They took the cure.  Staff is diverse, clientele is everybody, all treated the same, no matter what the quality of service.  The Lovely D and I were once ignored for two hours in a now-defunct chain restaurant.   We could only fantacize why four rounds of guests  were served before we got a glass of water.  We have never experienced that kind of treatment in a Denny's anywhere in the U.S.A.\n\nConsistent well known product, decently priced, fresh upholstery with no cuts, burns or gluteal imprint craters, table tops a new unworn color and pattern, carpet without tracks worn into it, considerable fresh paint, and the Max Cool talking dudes turned way down.  Mom likes the chicken noodle soup, which can be very good restaurant chicken noodle soup, service and quality are decent,  I promise we will return.
4 ||| I wanted to say the staff and Dr. Martins are the top of their field!  I would trust them any day with my four legged babies!!!  Gismo and Lady love them all!
4 ||| Is an OK venue....
2 ||| Not bad at all.\n\nWe had the red chili con carne burro and mexican pizza.  The meat in the burro could have been shredded a bit more but the flavor was nice.  I also like the little bed of shredded lettuce it comes on to help with the heaviness of the plate.  The Mexi pizza could have been a little easier on cheese and sliced olives all over it would have been nice.  But it was tasty enough.\n\nThe service was very good by the helper/busboy person but the waiter was a little on the slow side.  I'd like to check out their happy hour.
4 ||| Fig and marscapone bruschetta is to die for. I crave it all the time! Vintage 95 in Chandler has attempted to copy Postino's recipe for success, but it doesn't compare to the service, atmosphere and quality that Postino is known for. Prices are completely fair, wine and beer selection is great. The Mixed Green salad was totally amazing. I drive 30 minutes from Gilbert to get there, and it is worth every minute. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open! One of the best places in Phoenix, hands down.
4 ||| Never have I been to a pizza / bar in Az better then here and I can't believe it's taken me 20 ish years to finally give this spot a whirl.\n\nPros: \n\nGreat Pizza, Cheap Beer, Waitresses that don't stank, great appetizers, decent prices, perfect ora, Great UFC bar, you can even bring your mom and dad here :)\n\nCons: I'm not there with a cold draft in my hand\n\n\nThe S. Bro's pizza combo was legit, heck everything we had tasted good and was hot.\n\nThe guy next to me smashed his king crab legs so I am sure you can find something you like here.\n\n\nIt's worth your time, see ya there!\n\n\n\n\nedit : 9/25/ 11\n\nI have been there a few times since and the service has been lacking. I wish the staff would pay more attention, especially during the lunch rush. I noticed they like to bunch up and talk and when you only have 30 minutes to eat and you can't get your check it tends to tick me off.  \n\n- asked for ranch and received a snappy response\n\n- people next to us tried to combine tables and was met by a rude waitress telling them they can't do it and almost to the point of yelling at them gave them no option except sitting in tables next to each other in a snappy fashion. \n\nmeh, I have experienced better
0 ||| I've been to quite a few amusement parks...and this was by far the worst.\n\nI purchased my tickets, dining plan and parking ticket online thinking it would be the best way to go. We had no problems using our admission ticket or parking ticket. They actually eliminated a lot of waiting time.\n\nWhen we got into the park we grabbed a park map and got moving. This park is set up so strange. The map didn't even help. There was no rhyme or reason to where things are located. The rides were decent, bring Advil and a neck brace...you will need them after going on the coasters...\n\nHere's all the negatives:\n\n- Lines: No wait times are displaced. The \"rat cages\" are not big enough to accommodate the lines, leaving people hanging out in the \"roads.\" It's just one big cluster f*ck.\n\n- Dining Plan: We purchased this for $15.99 thinking we were going to save money. We had no problem using the passes for our meal...we each got a burger or sandwich, drink and fries. The snack was another problem. Even though it says \"restriction may apply\" we were very disappointed in the signage letting us know what's allowed. You CAN get Dipping Dots...but only at a certain cart. Try finding that cart...I dare you. No one ended up with the snack they wanted, we wandered around the parking trying to find places we could use it. It turned out to be a bigger pain than anything. SKIP THIS.\n\n- Workers: Rude, rude, rude. I only encountered ONE nice worker that day. Take a hint from Disney...those people actually seem to enjoy their jobs.\n\n- 3D glasses: They make you pay for parking, food and tickets....and now they want $1 for 3D glasses. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\n\nThis was supposed to be a fun family day and it turned into a bigger headache than anything. We will not be returning.
0 ||| Beyond disappointed. I'd give this zero stars if I could. I now know why these are going out of business. Food isn't fresh at all. Especially the salad I received. There shouldn't be any rotten greens in a salad. Ever! More black leaves then green leaves. Wow this is straight up common sense. Didn't see anyone being served moldy flatbread but I would put it past this joint. Won't be back... EVER!
4 ||| About 15 years ago, the owner would sell pocket sandwiches to people sitting in traffic along 2nd ave. I tried one of these and it was excellent: a good combination of fresh baked bread, meat, spices, etc. I've stopped by a few times since, but you never really know what will be served, or if the place is even open. This is truly a one man operation, and definitely an experience in dining. So yes, make your reservation, bring a bottle of Hungarian Bull's Blood wine, and enjoy authentic Hungarian cooking and a social experience.
4 ||| Hail to the Orange,\nHail to the Blue,\nHail Alma Mater,\nEver so true!\nWe love no other\nSo let our motto be\nVictory, Illinoisssssssssssssss!

0 ||| Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well
1 ||| A no-frills, no charm grease spoon.  I felt ill after eating the hot dog here.  I hear the italian and gyro sandwiches are tasty here, but I'm too scared to go back.  It has some regulars and seems to be a popular place with the guys.  Try your luck and write a review.
3 ||| It's the place I have to go to get anywhere from Roanoke, VA it seems.  Decent enough but it seems to be starting to show the years these days.  I really have to say I just don't care for the restroom attendants.
2 ||| In my quest for the best Italian Beef sandwich in Phoenix, I took the advice of a friend from Chicago and tried Lukes.  I must say that it was very good.  The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was because of the peppers, and giardinieri.  The meat was excellent, as was the bun.  If I was rating the sandwich strictly based on that I would have give it 5 stars.  The au jus was fantastic as well.  And they dipped it perfectly.  It was soggy like it should be, but I could still pick it up and eat it.  The only issue I had was the peppers and giardinieri.  I get mine with both hot and sweet peppers.  The giardiniera lacked something.  For one thing there was not enough of it on the sandwich so it was missing that spicy kick.  The sweet peppers were not cut up, so it was just one big roasted red and green pepper.  Slicing it up smaller helps when eating the sandwich.\n\nThe only other issue I had was the price.  After adding both peppers, small fries, and a small coke, my bill came to $12.40.  That's about 4-5 dollars more than I pay for the same thing at other places.
2 ||| There are good points to this place but the management turn over is less than a year. My mom just discovered bed bugs in her room and another resident said she had them six months ago. Although they called the exterminators right away, the best they could offer my mom was to stay in a vacant room with a cot. And when I picked her up to stay with me for the night, they had no idea how long she needed to be away from her room (one day - one week).\n\nBesides that, my mom loves the food and All Care Services have been very nice and helpful with managing my mom's medications.
1 ||| It had some good reviews so i thought i would check it out.....naaaaaahhhh......wasn't good enough for me...as soon as we were ready to order( since it was 8:35 and they close at 9pm) the lady said \" we close at 9\" lol....wow.....like do you want business or not!!!! I could've went somewhere else but since i did have a four loko....i was a little not all there lol...anyway to make story short...you NEVER, NEVER TELL A CUSTOMER WHAT TIME YOU CLOSE ...I was very well aware of that...i understand chinese people have different customs but we're not in CHINA...IT'S AMERICA ( DO YOU WANT YOUR CUSTOMERS TO COME BACK...JESUS!!!!.....the orange chicken i ordered was nice and crispy but it didnt have that orange spicy kick to it, i asked for brown rice and got white.....another disappointment. I wont b back...
0 ||| The only reason I put one star is because I had to. One of the poorest managed and run motels that I have ever seen. The rooms were very sub-par with mold on the bathroom ceiling. There were crumbs in the bed and they weren't very clean.\n\nThe rooms' walls were very thin and you could hear everything that went on from people stomping around upstairs to listening to doors banging constantly. There was a ton  of noise from these places as well as the highway running parallel to the hotel as well as adjoining rooms.\n\nManagement was the worst of all. Horrible at enforcing the rules so other guests can be very discourteous as well as riff raff running around outside peeking into locked vehicles almost as if they were trying to find a way to break in. Head manager is very hard to understand as he doesn't speak English clearly with no common sense on how to run a business.\n\nOverall, one of the poorest run hotels I have seen in a long time and for the money, many other choices in the area which provide way better service and accommodations. So overall, easy to make a better choice anywhere else. Beware.
3 ||| they have the best food and the greatest mushroom soup ever. sadly, they are so damn crowded! ahahahahaha.
1 ||| Update: 4 Months later. Shortly after my review a response was posted asking me to contact them. I am not one to chase people down and my work day is incredibly busy. \nHowever, I made a couple of attempts to contact him over the first week, but he was always \"out\" or \"unavailable\". So I put my concerns in an email and sent that to him. I resent that same email 6 more times over the past 4 months, even as recently as 1 week ago. Still no response.\n\nLast Thursday I filed a complaint against this dealership for it's poor customer service and lack of any response to my complaint against them. GM told me I would receive a response from one of their customer experience managers in 24 to 48 hours. No response after 7 days,\n\n8:30 this morning. I got a call from Lonny. He told me he was contacted by GM and that he understood I needed to schedule service because I had an airbag light on and something with my brakes. His exact words. I told him if that was what he got from my complaint, then he needs to start over and I hung up the phone. I was insulted. After all this time someone actually thought I filed a complaint with GM because I needed to schedule service. There is a serious communication breakdown here and Lonny had no clue at that point who I was or that I had contacted him so many times previously or more importantly he never addressed my complaint from May!\n\nI called GM right after that and gave them a piece of my mind. They are supposedly straightening this out and my complaint should be addressed. After all the time that has passed, you would think that at least one person that I have contacted would care. GM continually apologized and told me they would address my complaint in less than 48 hours and they failed too.\n\nI have a right to have my vehicle serviced at the most convenient location to me. I deserve to be treated fairly, with respect and I expect and deserve to pay a fair price. Freeway and GM have failed me in all aspects in this area.\n\nI am in the valley working on a project and while I am out of my hometown, I deserve the same HIGH quality of service that I get at my local Chevy dealership. I would even settle for mediocre, but I will not be disrespected anywhere. I am still going to be here for a while and I need maintenance service now and I will need it again in the future. Freeway has put me in a position where it suites me best to find someone else to service my vehicle and I will have to suffer the ramifications for that.
0 ||| I would find another gym if I were you. It's always crowded so the machines are always full with the free weight section being the worst. The equiptment is old and the place is filthy! No one ever wipes down their station and I've NEVER seen anyone from mountainside do it either. The constantly run out of towels, especially if you get there after 6 and it's not a surprise to have your favorite cardio machine out of order which will remain that way for weeks before it gets fixed. If you like Yoga (no the gentle kind) then the room that they have reserved for it is the size of a bathroom so if you don't get there early you can forget about getting a spot. Spend the extra $10 a month and go to Lifetime instead.
2 ||| So the coffee is good but the staff is incredibly loud and screaming does not make for a relaxing atmosphere at all.
0 ||| TRASH. \n\nI can't tell you about the bartenders. But I can let you know the door man and some other bounces are not pleasant. \n\nI've been here a few times. It compares to Dandelion but about 10 times trashier with staff who don't really care about there customers.
2 ||| Bean Curd Sea Bass and Fried Rice from here is decent. \n\nService HELLA SUCKS here though!
2 ||| The Clock is one of those old-Charlotte Greek family owned places that has been around Charlotte for a long time.  This is not their original location, but I don't think it is too far from where they were at first.\n\nIt is located by the little strip shopping center on the corner of South Blvd & Tyvola road and can be easy to miss the first time you go. \n\nIf you have eaten at the BBQ King on Wilkinson and liked their food, you'll like this place... the food is about the same but it is a sit-down restaurant housed in a former fast-food joint. \n\nOn the menu, you will find BBQ (minced or sliced), French Fries, Onion Rings, Burgers, Fried Chicken, Fried Fish, Hamburger Steak, Coleslaw and that sort of thing. \n\nThey do have the take-out window in operation, but I think that is only for call-ahead orders. \n\nWhen I am in the mood for a good onion ring but don't have time to go all the way to BBQ King on Wilkinson, this is the place to go. \n\nPrices are cheap, but just about everything here is fried, so if you're trying to eat healthier fare, you might want to think twice before you stop in. \n\nTheir sweet tea is pretty sweet - if you are a native from NC, SC, or GA, you might like it. Otherwise, you might find it a tad too sweet.
3 ||| Villa used to be really good and reasonably priced.  Ever since their facade renovation, addition of a ice cream machine, and maybe even date a little farther back ... the overall offerings are overpriced by about $2.00 per item on average.\n\nThe pizza is good, but if you order during rush hour you're in hit-or-miss territory for quality and temperature.  Hoagies are usually good regardless of how busy they are, it's just a matter of how long it'll take between ordering the hoagie and finally getting to eat said hoagie.  I haven't tried their salads or other dishes ... but for the most part I have heard nothing but positive reviews about their food.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of thin flimsy crusted pizzas ... so while nice sometimes, I continue looking for a nice thick slice of pizza that I can adopt as my \"go-to\" quick lunch in Downtown Pittsburgh.
0 ||| Don't stay here! The rooms are old, the door was falling off the hinges, light fixtures chipped, the bathroom calling leaked right over the toilet, there are cigarette butts all over the ground, the majority of the staff could careless you are a paying guest. The wifi occasionally worked. It was a very uncomfortable experience.
3 ||| Those who read my reviews know I have A LOT to say.   But for once, I shut up and just shoveled the massive amounts of food they serve here down my gullet.  And to reflect that mood, I will keep this review as short and sweet as I am able to do.\n\n-Sub egg whites for $1 more\n-Make it a three egg omelette instead of the regular 6, -$ .95\n-Chicken fried steak is a MUST try.\n-Try the pumpkin bread. . .I'm hesitant to say this but. . .it's better than the one I make (and I make a damn good one!)\n\nEat here next time you're in Vegas. . .I sure will!
3 ||| I typically go to Nail Candy on the Southside, but they are not dependable. Meaning you never know if anyone will be there .....they close early and don't pick up their phone. So I was determined to get my nails done that day so I asked Siri \"nail salons near me\" and Nails USA came up. I'm not from around here so I never heard of them and was kinda nervous when I read some of the reviews. I went inside they took me immediately when I walked in... This really nice lady named Nancy did my gel nails and they turned out amazing!! I have to say way better than Nail Candy!!! It's so random that I found this place but I'm going to come here from now on :) I had a great experience! \n\nP.S. - I didn't rate them a 5 because you do have to wait only one person does the gel/ nail art.
3 ||| Okay, I'm so not as cool and hip as the people who regularly shop and work here are...but I feel almost as cool as them when I do shop here. \n\nHaha. \n\nThis play is pretty cool. My wife sells clothes here all the time. We went here today actually and she got about $70 in store credit. \n\nI got a couple of shirts. Nice shirts too!\n\nLast time she sold some clothes, she got about $80. \n\nShe got me some clothes then too, haha. I feel bad using her credit. :P\n\nPeople here are nice, some of the workers have that attitude thing going on. \n\nBut it's probably because they're too cool for school.
4 ||| I have had Pho and Pad Thai many different places and also in a many different cities and this place is hands down the greatest! I have introuced many friends to this place, I  would say over 20 and every single one has gone back multiple times and a few have even become regulars. When I lived in Vegas I was a regular and even now whenever I'm in town you will find me here at least a couple times during my trip. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend their Pad Thai (chicken or beef) it's the most amazing Pad Thai you will ever have. The only bad thing about this place is their service, they will take long and a lot of times they will just completely forget about you except for one of the waiters he's always on point, friendly and very helpful (I forgot his name, he's the only young guy with spikey hair.) My other recommendation is the rare steak Pho, I've had Pho so many different places and nothing will ever come close to the broth at Pho Kim Long!! Enjoy!
4 ||| I love the pho so 1
4 ||| They make a decent pizza with ample toppings and a chewy crust. Better, their sauce is sweet!
4 ||| It's like a non-country, trendier version of Cracker-Barrel. Cute, cozy, filled with nicknack's and plenty of charm. On the downside, it can get a bit crowded, and there is not much parking, but overall- it's a nice local spot  with plenty of delicious goodies to try. \n\nTip- lots of good wine to choose from!
0 ||| If I could give this place lower than one star I would!  Here's the story-I'm an out-of-towner suffer an injury and transported by ambulance to this hellhole. I wait on a board for over an hour and 45 minutes - almost peed myself waiting for a nurse to see me - waited forever for a doctor to finally see me and tell me that I had a concussion.  I'm telling you I would've called out on all fours to get out of that place. Not a lot of friendly staff I think my husband encountered two friendly people out of that whole place.  I truly hope that Las Vegas has better medical facilities in this place. Because my advice if you're injured bleeding or need a heart transplant get yourself on a plane and get the heck out of there if this hospital is your only choice.
4 ||| Best soul food in Charlotte. Other than the clogged arteries, nothing to complain about. The cornbread is amazing by the way, probably the most memorable part of my meal.
4 ||| I love chicken and waffles. That is the best idea anybody ever had. I think Lo-Lo's is the best. Even better than that famous place in California. This was my first time at the Phoenix location. I have been to the Scottsdale location a few time. I don't know which one I like better. They are both great. The Phoenix one does have a very nice outdoor seating are. They have a big green outdoor couch that is very comfy. Great to hang out on while you wait for your table.\nI was there for the 4th meeting of the UYE Breakfast Club. Always a good time with great people. I know they have other things on the menu but how do you get by the chicken and waffles. One day I might have to go twice in one day so I can try something else. I ordered the 2 drumsticks and a waffle. #10. It was awesome of course. Don't forget the jar of Kool Aid. Yum. So good. Great service too. Everyone is always really nice. This is the place where I first tried grits. I have heard people complain about grits in general but these were great. Add a little honey and they are almost perfect. Maybe some cinnamon would put them over the top. This one of those places where the food is so good you can't stop eating even though you are full.\nThe place was very clean and the pictures on the wall are great. This is one of my favorite places and I will be back to this location or the Scottsdale one over and over again.
4 ||| Food is good, if not great.  The owners are very friendly.  Portion sizes are large.  They were very accommodating of our children.
4 ||| We've been using Park Ave Cleaners now for almost 7 years. We bring in coats with belts, suits, button up shirts, etc. The belt is always with the coat and tagged separately so it has never been lost. The shirts are always laundered and pressed nicely. Staff is polite, most things are ready within a couple of days, and the price is great. What more do you want from your cleaner?
4 ||| Chicago is only minutes away from uptown Charlotte.  Didn't you know that?  Well, Matt's Chicago hot dogs were as close to authentic as you are going to get in North Carolina.  \n\nChicago Dog Ingredients: Check \nRestaurant Ambiance: Excellent (Check)\nOutdoor Seating in a Park: Check\n\nGoing back for many more hotdogs:  CHECK!!\n\nThey also offer combos so you can wash down the dog with some delicious fries and a soda.  There are several other options besides the Chicago dog if you are feeling adventurous.  They also offer burgers etc etc.  I haven't tried the burgers yet and it may be a while because I'm going to keep getting the dogs.  I love hot dogs.  Enjoy!!\n\n-Ian M.
0 ||| I am very disappointed with Ruffino. We used to come in every month or two. However, we had a bad experience on Mother's Day and I wrote a note to the management and still haven't received a response. The service was beyond terrible that day and the place was packed because of a huge first communion party. There was a table of 10 unsupervised children right by us that were loud. The adults were sitting a few tables away and basically ignored them until it came time to serve cake. We asked the manager to do something and were ignored. There were issues with our order, slow service and an unpleasant experience. This saddens me because they have great food, but the service and execution just isn't there. We haven't been back since Mother's Day, and at this point I don't know if we will return because I don't feel like a valued customer. Management should take concerns raised by customers seriously and act on them, or at the very least respond to an email.
0 ||| Stay away from this company! 60+ wait while other companies actually knew how to quickly do the job. Use any other company! Rude employees also!
4 ||| There is something for everyone, healthy, and tasty. I take my clients here often and end up eating here 2-3 times a week. I can always try something new, and be happy with it.
4 ||| This past weekend was our first family trip to Scottsdale. We arrived into AZ about 10am, I called to see if we could do early check in and unfortunately the rooms weren't ready. That was fine, when we did check in we got a nice room with a patio. The patio was a shared patio with a view the pool. The bathroom was really small but, other than that it was a fairly nice sized room. The bedding was comfortable. The furniture was not dated and I didn't hear my neighbors through the thin walls as I had previously read. There is free valet parking so on days like Saturday afternoon when the lot was completely full; you just hand your keys over to valet and walk on into the hotel.\n\nThe only true negative is the restaurant inside the hotel is really pricey. The continental breakfast was $18 pp and $9 for a 2 y/o, I mean really what 2 year old eats $9 worth of food? Certainly not mine. I'm lucky if she finishes a complete bowl of cereal so dining there was out of the question.\n\nThe pool area and lobby were my favorite part of the hotel. The lobby is beautiful and  nicely decorated. The pool has a toddler pool which more hotels should make. My little love had an great time splish splashing with the other toddlers. I felt beyond comfortable. They keep the outside pool area stocked with pool towels and plenty of water. While I'm talking about the pool there is a hostess/waitress that comes by the pool and takes food and drink orders. Very attentive, amazing! The bar prices weren't steep at all. You have an option of charging it to your room or paying.\n\nI'm definitely a fan and we will stay here again. Maybe after we stay at the Double Tree! They have a free breakfast. :)
4 ||| Hello...it's Dairy Queen!!! #TeamOreoBlizzard
0 ||| A.K.A. Dirty Harry's. The only bar at Station Square that allows smoking. Carpeted floors lock in the freshness. 70's-era wood paneling on the walls for that rec-room/bad porno vibe. Not so much a destination, but if you find yourself down at the Square it beats the crowds and meat market mentality of the other establishments.\n\nPluses for almost all the bartenders, except the one that charges the customer after the owner buys a round.
3 ||| Mon-Fri lunch hours are filled with state employees, lobbyists, senators and representatives (during the legislative session).  This is the only times I go here b/c I work down here and it's a great place to grab lunch or to eat there.  You are not there for the ambiance.  Some construction has been going on for the past year or so to add on to this place but I really have no idea if and or when the new addition will be opened up.\n\nLet me recommend a few things:\n1. The Chicken Soup-- this is white meat, rice, chicken broth and pico, with fresh avocado. It is my favorite thing on the menu.\n\n2. Tacos and Enchiladas-- you can't go wrong.\n\n3. Do not order quacomole.  It is a green avocado-ish spread with cottage cheese.  Not sure why or what this is about.\n\n4. Lock your car in the parking lot.  And then double check to make sure it is locked.  \n\n**This place is located nex to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/circle-k-stores-phoenix-137#hrid:yi7ZhqXV8hG2MwF8Tlr0gw
0 ||| Great doctor with TONS of experience. Was able to diagnose the ligament issues with my shoulder in about 5 minutes after the Navy docs sent me to physical therapy and told me I was just \"getting old\". (I was 24 at the time. That's an unacceptable answer.)\n\nDr. Kelly is absolutely worth a visit.\n\nJust as an FYI, this doctor doesn't accept Tricare insurance. Not because they haven't tried to get on it, but because Tricare are jerks about chiropractors.
0 ||| I'm never going to eat at this place again.  We usually come here every vegas trip but this last trip we found a cockroach in our calamari.  Totally disgusting.  \n\n****BEWARE****
2 ||| Like the egg noodle stir fry a lot (they get it crispy, which is rare, it's usually soaked in oil), the sweet rolls filled with the custard are soooo delicious and I can't find them anywhere in so cal it seems. It's crowded and the place to be if you're an Asian living in this area and quite a fun experience if you're not (Asian ).Otherwise, it's pretty run-of-the-mill food and kind of pricey for the quality and location.
0 ||| Horrible management 30 minute waits on each hole because they cannot hire a starter who can do a mediocre job of managing a 27 hole course.
4 ||| A local favorite.  Fresh baked bread hot out of the oven with a delicious garlic, balsamic vinegarette to start.  A crisp Caesar salad and the Penne e Broccoli(I like the wheat penne).  Dinner was delish . Love the service here.  It feels like home. I recommend this to anyone looking for a genuine Italian homemade dish.
1 ||| Ok, I get the whole glasses scam.  I've worn them my whole life and with the exception of a few good years after lasik, I've always been tied to them.  Drives me crazy to go to my optometrist and have him show me frames that \"retail\" for $250 but my insurance will cover \"most\" of it.  I can go to Costco (and I typically do) and get a complete pair of fashion frames and lens for about $150 and then I have to file the insurance paperwork-no big deal. I've even bought a couple of pair on Warby Parker.com for about $100 each-again, great glasses.  \n\nHowever, I need (want) a pair of good prescription sport (read:Oakley) sunglasses for biking and triathlons. Against my better judgement, I made a special trip to the LenCrafters only to be put off by the arrogant clerks and the OUTRAGEOUS pricing.  Lens alone for Oakleys, (please make sure you're sitting down): $390, plus $120-$250 for the frames.  Target, WarbyParker, Costco: all better options than this. True they don't carry Oakley but $500 for a pair of prescription sunglasses is crazy.\n\n2/10/2014 update. I stand corrected. Target's optical ship is owned and operated by Luxottica so they have Oakley, Ray Bans, etc. Bought a pair of $99 sport glasses and got transition lens for $200-saved over 50% by going to Target. Great selection of true name brand frames, excellent pricing, and fantastic service.
3 ||| Gino's Italian Deli on Century Avenue is my go-to option for any time I don't feel like cooking or if I'm in the mood for an excellent sandwich.  In college I worked at a similarly-themed restaurant/deli so my expectations weren't too high when after college I moved out to Middleton.  I knew of the place and had driven by it multiple times but had never stopped until a fortunate visit from my father.  After helping me move a couch, my father took a look at my spartan apartment and said, \"Well at least you're pretty close to the Middleton Gino's.\"  Upon learning that I hadn't ever been to either the deli locations or the State Street restaurant he insisted on getting subs that night.  Even four years later I can still remember how satisfying it was.  \n\nOver the years I've moved several times but I've never strayed too far from Gino's.  I enjoy the hot subs to such an extent that I haven't managed to work my way through the menu yet, but here are a few of my favorites.  My standard order is the Italian beef with giardinera peppers, provelone and a dip.  I couple this with a quarter pound of the Cajun chicken salad and I'm set.  I've gotten into a few disputes over the authenticity of the #12 Italian beef compared to the Chicago standards, but I believe you like what you were introduced to and for me this is the best it gets.  The #11 meatball sub is another favorite, so much so that I usually have a hard time deciding when I get up to the counter.  The cold subs on the menu are not to be overlooked either, although I find myself doing this all the time.  My personal favorite is the #14 artichoke & turkey.  The sweet and spicy honey mustard on this is perfect with the artichoke hearts and cucumbers, and this sandwich keeps well in the refrigerator so I like to take this in for lunch.  The #7 roast beef is great in it's simplicity - just thinly sliced beef with lettuce and horseradish sauce.  I like to pick up Gino's before heading over the Capital Bier Garten to meet up with friends and family, and the #7 tastes incredible with Capital Fest and 1900 (RIP).\n\nGino's is more than just sandwiches.  The lasagna is very well done and the fire chicken is a special treat.  When I get subs for dinner I often pick up a piece of lasagna for lunch the next day.  Just cut it in half and microwave it for three minutes.  I've also gotten a refrigerated pan of lasagna and cooked it for a big dinner before, and it turned out very well.  There is a decent selection of dry goods and sauces on the shelves, but being not so much of a cook myself I can't say I've tried any.  One thing to note - there is a cash discount so you can save a bit.  The prices are pretty cheap to begin with: my usual order of a #12 with Cajun chicken salad and lasagna for the next day comes in around $10.  There are times that I get bored with Middleton compared with downtown Madison, but having Gino's nearby makes it all worth it.
4 ||| Great service cashier very nice and polite and quick service  food was ready with 5 minutes and these are the best red chili burritos in town for sure hands down \nThe only thing is they need to do a little remodeling around the place
0 ||| This Michael's location is a disaster. \n\nAnd what's worse, all the glitter in the store and all the sparkly rhinestones still doesn't make up for the fact that customer service is dim. The fact that 5 employees can be standing in the front of the store talking about where to put the spray painted styrofoam gourds that were just marked down and not a single one is aware that customers coming in the door might want to be acknowledge and pointed in the right direction of what they seek is as crazy as buying styrofoam gourds. Why do you sell spray painted versions of something that naturally exists?! The check-out is always maddening, usually a line of 5 lovely ladies looking to scrapbook seasonal memories and me, and one person working the register who probably remembers totaling things on an abacus. \n\nI don't understand why the experience here varies so much from it's neighbor to the east where I'm greeted, helped when needed, and checked out with ease.
0 ||| Two of us ordered panini and they were very disappointing. Both were very heavy and greasy. The only non-meat option was 3 Cheese. All cheese and nothing else as far as I could tell, which made it unbelievably heavy. My husband had one of the meat options and commented it was heavy and greasy. They wrapped the panini in foil and by the time we walked 5 minutes to the park they were steamed and soggy.
1 ||| Oh, Wrigley Manson if only I had the means to fix you up and make you the amazing gem I know you could be.\nPhoenix is seriously lacking when it comes to historical buildings and homes. I have always been curious about the Wrigley Mansion so I was excited when we made plans to go here for Easter brunch. \n\nThe brunch was good. Our server was friendly and funny. There was a decent variety of food and it was tasty. My only complaint about the food would be the desserts. They were not labeled, the cakes and pies were whole so people cut their own slices and they became a mess. Overall I just wasn't impressed. I've seen better dessert spreads at casino buffets. \n\nAfter the meal we wandered around the building, exploring the rooms, peeking around corners and checking out the history. The bummer is that it's obvious that the money isn't there to keep this place looking its best. Some of the bathrooms were run down (burned out lights, doors that didn't lock), in one room the curtains were torn, walls and flooring showed signs of wear and tear, and furnishings just looked tired in places. It wouldn't take much to clean this place up and have it look amazing. I'm sure when the Wrigley family lived here it was incredible and it's sad to see such a great home being neglected. I'm sure if they fixed it up they would book more parties and weddings and it could be a prime location in town. \n\nI hope someone will take the time and money to invest in one of our rare glimpses into Phoenix's past. If it continues on this decline I don't think it will last.
4 ||| My group was drawn to the $20 a night special like, well, like thrifty Asians to a good deal I guess.  Seriously, $20 for a night plus 20 free wings, buy-one-get-one-free steak dinner for $10, and 2 free drinks at the pool bar were too good of a bargain.  My grandparents in Hong Kong would have crossed the Pacific Ocean for a Vegas deal that good.  A discount so prime that it almost masks the decrepit halls of this tacky establishment, home of daytime escorts and resting ground for strippers that just couldn't cut it.  If you came to the casino floor for pretty girls, prepare to be gravely disappointed at the selection of just grotesque herd animals you've ever seen.  They keep the prime stock in the Hooters Restaurant.\n\nBut seriously Hooters Girls, some of you are hot, but don't give my group fucking attitude while we order and act like you have so many important places to be in your empty restaurant.  Your unresolved issues of Daddy touching you inappropriately and that oh-so-interesting theory that hardcore porn is the \"gateway to Hollywood\", while amusing, should be checked at the door.  Although the blonde at the bar was especially nice to me and the gf.  You are an gentle-lady and a scholar.\n\nThe $3 Blackjack tables that they advertise like the saggy boobs of their older staff actually consist of ONE, yes ONE, table that is always full.  Comped drinks come at an excruciatingly slow pace since the table limits are so low they need to make money somehow, amiright?\n\nThe $.99 wings they advertise are also only available to hotel guests and only with the purchase of a drink.  Although you see $1.50 bud lights being hawked on the floor, the price increases in restaurants like Mad Onion where the wing deal is offered.\n\nOverall, the rooms were okay.  Not the worst that I've stayed in Vegas.  Twas fairly roomy and felt like a retired grandpa from Florida decorated everything with a tropical theme: a grandpa with debilitating Alzheimer's.  The beds were kind of musty, but sheets and room were cleaned daily.  Bathroom was kind of small and old, but what do you expect for $20.  It's a pretty alright place for being right next to the strip.\n\nTL;DR\nAt least it ain't the fucking Circus Circus
0 ||| I heard LASIK wasn't an option if you're eyes were dry, therefore I went in for a consult and dr. Schwartz told me I was a perfect candidate so I set it up.  Insurance wasn't an option so I forked out $4000.  Procedure was slightly painful and on one of my eyes it seemed like I smelled a burning smell and that eye took longer to heal.  \nVision was good for roughly a year, then my vision starting reverting.  After the procedure I was able to drive and watch tv without glasses, but know it was hard.  When I requested an enhancement I was told that now my eyes were too dry.  He gave me a bunch of drops and sent me home.  3 months later...eyes still too dry so he suggested plugs, which he was going to charge a ton for, so I had them done at nationwide for $400. I was upset.  Three months later, eyes still too dry for enhancement so he suggested restasis.  Gave me a few samples and a prescription that cost over $100 to fill.  For the next 21/2 years I was there every 3 months only to be told my eyes were too dry...no enhancement.  Why did he approve me in the beginning?  About 2 years after procedure he put me back in glasses which he was going to charge me full price for until I asked for a discount which I thought was fair.  I've been wearing them ever since.  He offers a guarantee that he will give enhancements if necessary, but apparently I was never eligible.  I actually called today to see if I could get my eyes checked to see where I stood with my vision and was informed that would be $100 for the visit.\nThis was a waste of money that I regret spending.  He doesn't want to do anything about it, he just wants my money so now I'm out over $4000.  I'm a single mom so this is a lot of money too me.  I'm actually headed to walmart vision center for a $49 exam to update glasses that I shouldn't even need...what a complete letdown
0 ||| Check all your items before you pay. I have gotten many items back with wrinkles ironed into them. \nThe only reason I take my shirts here is to have them pressed as I HATE ironing. \nIf I have to double check the work of a professional service then they are not worth my time.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Find another cleaner!!!
4 ||| Just as the one in Monona, I like La Bamba. They have very raw, \"you know what you're eating\" food. A lot of people who will probably low-rate this place prefer places like Pedros or Taco Bell with mystery sauces and fake ingredients abound. The food here is amazing with my favorite being the Veggie Nachos and Bean/avocado burrito. Hot sauce adds a lot of flavor to both and is absolutely necessary in my opinion to get the full experience.
0 ||| I'm not quite sure how it gets such good reviews. Every time I come I get bad service and bad food. I gave up but a friend wanted to go just for a margarita and queso. The queso was cold and chips were stale. Service also sucked. We got the check (finally) and left without eating to go somewhere else. No one who works here even smiles at you!  We also sat without touching our chips, queso, and guac and no one checked on us at the bar.
0 ||| I was underwhelmed by this hotel. Let's face it, it's a Sheraton so I wasn't expecting it to be the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, but at the same time I have come to expect a certain level of service and quality from the Starwood plan.  This being about my 6th Sheraton I have stayed at in the last year or so, I think I have it figured out what this hotel should be, what amenities I should come to expect, and what upgrades are usually provided with having SPG gold status.\n\nWhen I checked in on Friday night I was tired, coming down with a cold, and really just wanted to be home rather than checking into another hotel but unfortunately that wasn't an option on this particular weekend.  The check in desk girl was rude and extremely unhelpful - I get it, on a Friday night you are probably checking in a lot of people and are tired too, but it is your job to be friendly and give good information.\n\nAnyway, I was given a standard room, has to ask about parking (which the response was simply there is parking in the back or across in the garage....) and wasn't offered any info about the area, or the hotel.  The hotel room was fine - it is a little tired and could use some of the upgrades that they are starting to roll out at other Sheraton properties, but I didn't have anything to complain about at this point.\n\nOnce I got in my room I called down about dry cleaning as this is a service which most hotels do not offer on the weekend - well I was pleasantly surprised when she said they do offer in on the weekends as long as it is in before 9am.  So I packed up all my laundry, and dropped it off on my way out to dinner - things were looking up at this point.  \n\nAlso - this hotel is loud!  Between the trains rolling by, the hockey teams staying in the hotel with kids running down the halls, and the multiple wedding parties staying at the hotel this particular weekend, I was annoyed.\n\nOn Saturday morning I stopped down at the desk to ask about how the parking charges worked - it was at this point that they told me that to have the in and out privileges that I would have had to bring the garage ticket down after I checked in?  This would have been helpful to know when I checked in.  Also, I thought I would just check to make sure the laundry had got picked up - as it turns out no, they don't have weekend laundry.  Needless to say, I spent the rest of my morning on Saturday scrambling to find somewhere else to get my laundry done before Monday morning, something that would have also been easier to do the night before.\n\nI ate breakfast one morning at the hotel restaurant and it was just ok - the service was great and the girl waiting on my table was helpful and gave me lots of good tips about the area.  I also stopped in the bar on Saturday night for a glass of wine and dessert after dinner and was greeted by great service there too.  I think the front desk staff here could take some lessons from others that work at this hotel!\nOverall, I was underwhelmed by my experience here and will probably pick another hotel the next time I am in Pittsburgh.  It is unfortunate seeing that this in the only hotel in the Station Square area which is a safe area to walk around and go to some decent bars and restaurants on the weekend but the convenience just isn't worth the lack of service and quality I experienced here.
0 ||| Unfortunately being a Charlotte institution does not mean tasty food.\n\nOpen Kitchen has been around for a while, and it feels like it inside too. I have only found one thing on the menu that is actually edible (grilled chick sandwich). \n\nTheir tomato sauce is very nasty, tastes like it came straight out of a can. So stay away from anything that has sauce on it (95% of menu). \n\nMy workplace literally faces the back of OK and it sucks to smell food all day long, but know the taste will never be there.
4 ||| A few of us decided to go eat sushi after pulling a super long day at work.  I've been here before and liked the food.  It was close so we said why not?!\n\nIt's a hole in the wall type place on the corner of Pecos and Warm Springs.  Not very many seating, however, every time I've visited the location, I've always been seated right away.  Because of the small floor, they usually have only one server at a time.  If there are big parties, it can take a while before they come to your table.  \n\nWe usually get the same thing:  All you can eat for $23.95 per person.  Can I just say how wonderful of an idea that is!!  You get an entire menu, front and back to choose from.  I usually go for the side orders and if any sushi, from the Nigiri section I strongly feel getting your money's worth is important.  I don't ever want to be weighed down by lots of rice.  Here's somethings I love from the menu:\n\nShrimp Tempura:  batter is light and super crispy.  The dipping sauce is lightly salted and sweet at the same time.  Works well with the shrimp.\n\nTeriyaki chicken:  comes in a cast iron mini skillet sizzling!  It sits on a best of sliced onions and Teriyaki sauce.  Love!\n\nBacon Wrapped Scallops:  Small little bite sizes of mini scallops and salty bacon.  Yum!\n\nSweet Amaebi Shrimp nigiri sushi:  Comes with 2 per order, per customer.  The shrimp is sweet.  Works well as a bite sized sushi piece.  This dish is served with the deep fried heads as well.  That was a huge surprise, not into eating shrimp heads so I was kind of grossed out LOL.\n\nSoft Shell Crab:  The whole crab, battered, deep fried and cut into 4 huge pieces.  You can eat the whole crab.  The tangy and lightly spicy dipping sauce really works well.\n\nFried Gyoza:  Pork filled fried dumpling with a great soy dipping sauce.  \n\nHamachi Nigiri:  Love this white yellowtail sushi option.  Not too much of a fishy taste to it.  Really good!\n\nIf you're ever in the area, come down and get your sushi fix on.  Overall, this place is actually pretty good.  I would definitely come back and get the All You Can Eat option!!
0 ||| I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! \n\nEven though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\n\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \"workers\" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \"We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\n\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\n\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\n\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.
1 ||| Probably need to go back and try something else. My experience was a good one, and the service was perfect, but I normally rate on food, and it just wasn't all there for me. \n\nWe were greeted as soon as we walked through the door, placed at a table where we decided we'd take the bar seats that were open. They had no problems with this, not even a dirty look, that sometimes comes with it. You can definitely tell the staff has some bonds, not sure if it's family or just real good employer employee relationships. Needless to say, I love being lead to believe the workers actually like what their doing. The guy sitting at the bar next to me was obviously a regular, and while we didn't talk much, he was very friendly, and stated that everything was good. \n\nThe salsa was fresh, mild, but Can we say salt? Still had a good hint of lime that I enjoyed. The bright side of this was the chips needed no extra salt, it came in the salsa. The chips were deelish! Freshly made and perfect. For my meal, which came out so fast,  I chose the Carne Asada.  It was a plate of Carne Asada steaks, rice, beans, lettuce, and some pico.  Everything was real good, but the meat was too salty.  On that note, let me just tell you that I LOVE SALT, like I'm guilty of sprinkling it on my pizza (i know thats so bad), so maybe it was just my taste buds that day!  I washed this all down with an ice cold Tecate Light in a can, yup that's right!  I like cans, I'm just weird like that.  The bartender asked if I wanted a mug, so if you don't like cans, don't worry!\n\nMy BF had the frybread tostada thingy, I can't remember the name, but it was like an gigantic tostada on top of a fry bread with green chilli beef, lettuce, tons of cheese.  I tasted it and was very happy with it, it was like striped cubed beef, not shreeded.  It was good, we probably should have split it, it was huge.  \n\nI'll be back to check some other things out, I'll be sure an update accordingly.
0 ||| If I could give no starts I would. Up until this experience I have always used Sierra LLC. They initially installed my HVAC in the house when it was built. When we lived in the residence we had them out a couple times and were pleased. Not sure what changed, but our AC went out on our tenants, so we called Sierra as we had in the past. They came out a day later, charged $69 for them to even look at the system. After they trouble shot for a while I get a call telling me the estimate is $1100 to replace a control panel. This seems pretty high so I ask them to not do the repair. Boy am I glad. The next company, Legacy Air, came out and it was actually the blower motor. There were also other issued with the HVAC from previous repairs, all done by Sierra. Legacy fixed everything for under $540!  Never using Sierra again!  Scammers!
2 ||| One night during my visit to Arizona, I was extremely hungry and craving sushi. Dining at traditional sushi restaurants was not an option ($$$$). I searched all over town for AYCE sushi and Sushi Q was the only restaurant that Yelp returned within Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, Phoenix, and Scottsdale. I jumped into my car and quickly roared out to Sushi Q at around 7:00pm. Sushi Q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. When I arrived during happy hour, there were only 3 people in the restaurant! There's no need to beat the dinner rush here. \n\nI sat at the bar and designated myself as an AYCE customer. After perusing the order menu, I was upset to discover an 8 order limit on the nigiri. 8 orders = 16 pieces. When I eat AYCE sushi in California, I typically average ~50 pieces, with a personal record of 64. Nobody cares how much you order in California, as long as you don't throw up on premises. Apparently not the case in stingy Arizona.\n\nThe nigiri menu is sparse with limitations to the basic fish. Uni was not an option on the menu. Neither were any premium fish (not even off the AYCE menu). I ordered the standard choices: albacore, mackerel, red snapper, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallop, and yellowtail. The rice was served at room temperature as it should be. The fish quality of the tuna, salmon, and red snapper was acceptable, but the presentation for the other sushi was poor. Excessive ponzu sauce and green onions were applied on top of the yellowtail, mackerel, and albacore, to the point where I could not taste the distinct flavor of each fish. See photos for the sloppy preparation and the overuse of onions. The quality was disappointing even for a Korean sushi chef.\n\nFor economic purposes, Sushi Q expects AYCE customers to fill up on appetizers and rolls rather than the fish. I feared leaving with a half full stomach, so I ordered rolls and appetizers after the nigiri. Rolls do not have order limits, but premium rolls were strategically removed from the AYCE menu. I asked for the negi salmon roll, yellowtail roll, and rainboll roll. The rolls were handled by a Hispanic sushi chef. The rainbow roll was standard, although the rice was a bit stiff. Yellowtail roll was a salty disaster, with excessive garlic/chili sauce drenched over the fish that spread to the rice. Fortunately, the negi salmon roll was acceptable with minimal sauces used and generous amount of salmon in each piece.\n \nBe aware that appetizers are full orders. I ordered agedashi tofu expecting just a few pieces of hot tofu. Instead, I received a basket full of fried tofu enough to feed a family of 3. The agedashi tofu was a joke. It was supposed to be served in a broth with Katsuobushi, Japanese onions, some rice wine, and soy sauce, but all that was given was a bowl of soy sauce separated from the tofu.\n\nIn the end, I left with a full stomach but was dissatisfied with the quality of food consumed. I came to eat sushi but was instead instructed to order mediocre rolls engulfed in puddles of assorted sauces. The 16 piece limit is a severe limitation that renders the AYCE option as not cost-effective ($23.95 for dinner).
3 ||| Que Club is located in Commercial Center near Maryland and Sahara.  Commercial Center isn't the nicest area that you'll probably see, but it has gotten slightly better than what it used to be.  There's plenty of tables located inside Que Club.  A couple arcade games located near the front, and they have regulation tables, smaller tables and the extra large tables.  They also have a glow in the dark table for those who want that cosmic pool table feeling.  Prices are decent.  There's also plenty of asian food to eat around the area.
1 ||| I'm quite keen on service. Their service here was horrible. Maybe I could say bad timing for me, but regardless of time, it was still horrible service. Walking in, do find my own seat? I guess I do since there happened to be servers running to and fro and perhaps avoiding newly arrived customers. Whatever the case, I went ahead and pulled myself a chair. \n\nWaited quite a bit to finally get an order from a server, but I think at this time, I was already fed up with bad service. Fast forwarding from bad service, the drinks were all right. Tasted better. \n\nStill on the hunt on finding a nice place with decent service and serves delicious tea. If anyone else has, let me know.
4 ||| I moved away from Pittsburgh 4 years ago and still miss this place. Not the most authentic food ever, but I think it's great! Quick, easy, and conveniently located.
4 ||| Always a very good quanity of trucks to choose from. Quickly get you out and checked in.
4 ||| Definately my kind of place- Diamond in the rough... Fresh seafood... and cheap beer! The food was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try that giant seafood pot!
0 ||| HORRIBLE over fried unrecognizable meat in hard batter. Rice is reheated.
1 ||| Maybe I'm just spoiled but this place is sub par. Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is line on the weekends and a wait of anywhere from 10 -30 min. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking \"I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's\".
0 ||| Heard good things about Napoli, however our first experience was not good. The food took forever to come out...for just a Caesar salad and spaghetti. Blackened chicken Caesar was ok. Prices were high for their \"lunch specials\" and didn't even include bread. Spaghetti was horrible and served on a dirty plate. I would have gone across the street to Fazoli's next time.
4 ||| I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience.
0 ||| I am writing this review for my poor sister who ordered their delivery last night.  She ordered the spring rolls, summer rolls and mieng sabai.  She specifically asked no peanuts because she is still breastfeeding and her son is allergic.  After an hour wait, she received her food; ALL of it contained peanuts.  She called back the University location and was told that they would call her back. They did not. She then called the Odana location and was told that none of those dishes contained peanuts...hmm, funny because they did! The woman on the phone did not offer to remake the food or even offer an apology...tsk tsk. I understand that this is a family owned restaurant and inconsistency in service/food happens - but to simply not offer to remake her food was ridiculous because the order was wrong and she was unable to eat the food that she paid for.  \n\nService has always been a little iffy here, but because food continued to be yummy, we could not stop ourselves. But this time was the last straw. I hope Sa-Bai Thong can re-evaluate their customer service, or else they will continue to lose loyal customers their business is built upon.
4 ||| Food was amazing.  There was lots, but quality did not suffer.  Wait staff professional and helpful.  I can't wait to take my wife and family!
3 ||| I used them regularly when I lived in Pittsburgh, and now that I have left the area I realize how much they spoiled me.  It's rare to find a repair place with consistently great quality, reasonable prices, and pleasant service.   I only used them for minor repairs, but they seemed fully capable of major things as well.  I recommend them to anyone.
4 ||| Retta is knowledgeable, intuitive and strong.  She gives a great massage.
0 ||| This is supposed to be a place of healing & relaxation. Never in my life have I ever been MORE upset & distressed than after having to endure an office visit from so-called \"Dr.\" Pisano!!!\nThis is the \"used car salesman\" of doctors! I went for a \"free\" x-ray & consultation. By the time I left the office, I was so upset that I was physically shaking! Pisano traumatized me to the point that I STILL get upset just thinking about that awful experience! :-(\n\nI sat down in his office & he started off asking how much my wellness is worth to me. I explained I didn't make much over minimum wage & he kept pushing & pushing me into signing a contract that he knew I couldn't afford trying to make me feel like I didn't care about my health because I wouldn't sign up for his shady contract that I couldn't afford!\n\nDO NOT GO TO PISANO!!!!!\nWORST EVER!!!\n\n(The others in the office were ok, but not worth enduring his traumatic tactics! Tho, even the staff wasn't what I'd call \"good\", as I was given a complimentary massage to make up for another issue they had & when I went, they didn't even have my appt. scheduled!)\n\nGo to a better dr! I recommend Dr. Q! :-)
4 ||| I paid this place a visit after I finished my Christmas shopping in less than an hour, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The food and the service were both great. Seafood and Cajun food seems to be their thing and they do it right. Great place to go when you're in need of something different.
4 ||| So there was booze involved, this was in Vegas after all. I have been to many fat burgers in my life but this was hands down the best. \n\nSpecial ordered of course, just requesting to leave off the bun which kind of confused the cashier but the cooks were all over this request. Packed our two patties into a little fry container and then topped it with all of the traditional fat burger toppings. \n\nFantastic drunken nomz.
4 ||| Just walked in and Wendy waited on me. She gave me a very nice cut after listening to what I was asking her. She took the time to ask me what I wanted done and talked with me throughout the cut. She was very pleasant. The store was very clean. I would recommend Wend to anyone. It was a nice experience.
0 ||| AWFUL AWFUL cellular service in AZ. I mjust switched from T mobile to At &T and BOT was that a stupid move. They are most unhelpful - I have dealt with them in the store, Customer service via phone and chat online and no one will help.... lousy phones lousy service. I have no texts for hours. I mget messages after a 2 hour to 24 hour delay. Ridicu;ous. If it is was not for IPHONE thises people would not be in buisness
4 ||| Best sushi in the valley!! Been going here for at least 10 years :)
3 ||| Last night was my first time here and it was delicious!! I can't believe I didn't try this sooner. It was for a work party and boy am I glad we decided to come here! The pizza was so flavorful and simply delicious! \n\nMy only concern was the service, over all it was great but the waitress did forget my water... I asked twice, and it wasn't until our dessert that I finally got the water..
4 ||| Yum! This place has the most unique atmosphere, I love it! Went here after The Adventure Run for their special happy hour and ruly enjoyed myself. The decor is really authentic and urban and the bar area is insane with the lighting and graphics. I ordered a big burger and was pleased, not over the moon thrilled, but satisfied. \n\nI highly suggest the happy hour menu. The food is cheap and delsihcious and the drinks are a good price too. Got a very worth it, very strong Marg for $3. I was just so impresed with our waiter too. We had a large group and he was really attentive and ok with al the check spiltting and plate sharing. Good guy.
1 ||| I know the critical reviews about this place are usually positive so I tried to go in with an open mind every time. This place is loved and a quick go to when trying to pick a proper Chinese restaurant. \n\nHowever, no matter how hard I try, I don't think that it's all it has been cracked up to be. Their food is okay and sometimes too salty. I think that while the dishes are authentic, it isn't done well enough for the price you pay for it. I am usually a bit disappointed after leaving this place. The place is small and cramped and you can tell that they didn't put much effort into making it be aesthetically pleasing.
0 ||| Food - not so good.\n\nI've eaten here twice for breakfast.  The first time I got a basic eggs, potatoes, meat dish and it was okay.  The second time I got california eggs benedict - big mistake.  The Hollandaise sauce was disgusting, and did not look like Hollandaise.  It looked more like cheeze whiz.  I scraped it off.\n\nI wouldn't say run like the hills if you're hungry, but I also won't eat there again unless I have to.
2 ||| Hidden vegan item bursting with flavor that even the most zealous carnivore could endure: Whole Grain Tuscan Linguine sans cream topped with tofu. Giggity. \n\nIf you've not had the pleasure of sinking your chompers into their Ride Krispy Treat, you're not living life to the fullest. I'm convinced the generous wedge of ooey gooey marshmallowy goodness is straight out of an angelic bake sale recipe book. I don't want the secret - I just want them to never stop - ever.
0 ||| Hot damn!\n\nSushi places have always been for me a measure of better or worse of fundamentally the same tastes.  But this place... this place offered flavors that I have never experienced before, and I don't know how to describe them, but they were incredible.  And the presentations were works of art.  My wife's vegetable roll had four distinct textures.  It was outstanding because of how it felt!  \n\nI had live shrimp for the fist time.  For those of you who don't know, it's live until they fry the head in tempura batter and serve you the tail raw.  Now, I don't know what was in that dipping sauce, but when I tasted it from the serving bowl, it knocked my socks off, like sipping vinegar only smooth and addicting with a flavor that soaks the inside of your head and makes you screw your eyes up as acidic things do.  \n\nThis is a true five-star place, without reservation.
0 ||| I see now that this place is closed and for good reason. I took my son here back in September and it was an awful experience, not to mention unexpectedly expensive. I ordered an omlet with white cheese and received yellow cheddar, had them remake it and it was runny. I did not eat it. My son ordered a skillet and they forgot to add the egg on top. The waitress brought him the egg and when he poured it over the skillet it was still raw! He did not eat his either. I did have a pancake that was very fluffy and good. The service was terrible and slow; I did not leave a tip! The place was also dirty. I had to request a clean coffee cup. I was not a fan and would never return.
4 ||| This place is amazing for their lunch buffet! I love their mango chicken and banana cake! I'm not sure if it's just the food or what, but the Pepsi seems to taste different. In a good way, though. I usually hate Pepsi. The environment of the place is really relaxed. I love going here.
4 ||| I ate here with both my pregnancies because I had gestational diabetes and the frozen yogurt kept my sugars in check. It is rather expensive but they are very generous portions. Now I take my kids in for a treat! Oh, and if you have your dog in the car ask for a \"puppy cup\" of free vanilla yogurt for your dog!
0 ||| We went to Morton's tonight with the intention of having the $19.78 Make-A-Wish burger. Pricey for a burger, but it was at a steak house, and for a good cause. \n\nWith the desire to end on a good note, here's the ugly:\n1. It's in the Camelback Esplanade, easily the most screwed up yet supposedly upscale shopping center in the valley that smells like poo.\n2. If one of the things that makes you \"cool\" is a verbal menu, you might want to make sure your servers know the menu. As a teacher, I have a fair amount of patience and mercy. Had we spent $200+ on dinner, which if we had partaken of their \"normal\" menu would have easily been the case, I would have been miffed. As it was, I was amused and a little concerned for the young man's career.\n3. If Big Wong's Chinese on Indian School can consistently serve me a flawlessly cooked and completely grit-free dish of scallops for $10, why can't you manage it? \n4. You're a steak place. If you can't cook my burger correctly, do you think I'm going to risk $50 on a steak? Just sayin'... I know Ruth's Chris and Capital Grill can do it right.\n\nAlright. It wasn't a TOTAL waste of time and money:\n1. Hubby liked his 5-onion soup. I thought it was too thick and had an odd herbal or even floral bouquet. But I am not the French Onion soup connoisseur.\n2. In spite of the done-ness issue, the burger was very well seasoned and tasty overall. You had a choice of 4 cheeses, onion and mushroom saute, and a side dish (any of their potato options or their standard salads). The Lyonnaise potatoes were really good, as was my baked potato, and as large as my two fists together).\n3. The drinks were tasty and strong, but expensive. Their beer selection is crap. \n\nOoops. What happened to the positive note? Extra star for the charity tie. There you go.
4 ||| I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!
0 ||| This place was terrible! I decided to be adventurous and try a new place, big mistake. I specifically asked for Mei fun, which is like angel hair noodles, they brought me fat, wide noodles. The house special had octopus, some bone or knuckle thing in it, scary fish, scarier pork, and some sort of chicken. Disgusting. Save your money!
2 ||| I am conflicted about this zoo. On the one hand, it offers an excellent opportunity to get close to the animals. On the other hand, I think they simply do not have the funds to give the animals as much space as they deserve.\n\nThis zoo has a lot of birds and other small animals. The habitats are arranged in rows of cages about 23-30 ft square for a family or several families of smaller animals, with separate areas befitting the species of larger sizes and different needs. Some special areas of note are the Walkabout trail and the giraffe area.\n\nThe Walkabout is a circular trail of about 50-60 yards in circumference, around which families of wallabies roam free. Along the side of the trail is a fenced area for Emu. You can get pretty close to the animals and they do not seem to mind. There are great opportunities for photos. The giraffes are in a large field of about 100 yards with an elevated deck in the middle, from which guests can get a close-up view of the animals.\n\nThe cages for the leopards are interesting. The cats can go into an area that stretches above the pedestrian path, offering guests a very close view from underneath. There is a double fence separated by about a foot, so even very tall children (or childlike adults) cannot get their hands into the vicinity of the leopard unless they really are trying to become handicapped.\n\nThere are shows a few times a day put on by the zoo staff, but I did not witness one while I was there. It seemed there were very few patrons the day I went, so I am not sure the shows took place. I also hit the show areas at off times. I believe the show I missed was an opportunity to get an up-close view of wild birds.\n\nWildlife World seems to have an abundance of birds, and also many varieties of marine and amphibious life. The aquarium and reptile habitats offered an indoors break from the heat, and some fine views of amphibious and aquatic wildlife, as well as some insects. There were some nice displays of rare fish, including a ray tank where one is allowed to reach in and touch the rays. One interesting indoor area I will include here is the place where they house the baby animals. This building offers a few exhibits of animal infants, along with signs explaining their existence here.\n\nThe staff here seem to genuinely care for their animals, and the fact the treatment of the animals is so frequently addressed shows it is a concern. Unfortunately, proper treatment of wild species outside their natural habitats requires a great deal of money, and a great deal more space than they are afforded at this zoo. I am no expert, and perhaps I am wrong. In my opinion, the smaller birds perhaps have quite comfortable arrangements, however the gibbons and other small apes seemed to be too cramped. One gibbon swung hand-over-hand around the entire perimeter of the cage again and again. This behavior was entertaining to watch, and perhaps it was fun for him, but I couldn't help feeling as if it might get old for him after awhile. He did not have much vertical area in which to climb, as the roof of the cage is about 15 feet from the ground. The big cats have cages that are perhaps 20 yards square. Other animals like the warthogs, gazelle, and the like have pens of perhaps 50 yards square. Even the giraffes, while they have quite a large area, seemed restless in their environment. They were very exposed, and also their habitat bordered on a large galvanized steel warehouse building. I was disturbed to see the giraffes licking the side of this building, and wondered why they would do so. I'm sure it is quite harmless, but I could hot help feeling it indicates an unmet need that might be more naturally resolved than by licking a metal building.\n\nIn all, this zoo offers a great opportunity to get close to the animals. It is especially worth it if you like birds and fish. I would not invest the time if you are more interested in larger animals.
4 ||| LOVE THIS PLACE!! I don't even know where to start. If you have a unique gift to buy, need a funky item for your home, a gift card, a book, or simply have an hour or two to kill, you MUST check this place out. They have a large book selection on several topics, a ton of stationery, and just a large selection of randomness like naughty games and gadgets, candles, pocketbooks and wallets, funny pins and magnets, off-beat bridal gifts and the like. Great place to shop for a gift for people with a good sense of humor. Among the items in my goodybag I walked out with: 2 books by Eckheart Tolle, a set of cow kitchen magnets for my fridge, a pin that says \"Beer: it's what's for dinner\", and a card for my friend's wedding that reads on the inside: \"No matter what anyone says, I don't think either of you settled\". Awesome.
0 ||| I went here recently, and I had a spinach and cheese omelet.  A strange thing happened in the kitchen though, something kind of like the fog that turns you inside out, I suspect.  When my omelet came out it was actually a spinach omelet with a bit of egg and cheese tucked inside.  Wow, that is so crazy........oh and gross.  I am not Popeye, nor am I a rabbit, therefore playing a game of find the egg and cheese in a spinach haystack is not awesome dudes.  FAIL.
0 ||| Terrible value. This place should be like $70 a night. \nNo free breakfast, expensive wireless, pillows were either laughably huge or flat as a pancake, bad smells, no ventilation in bathroom, filthy carpet, cuddled creamer for the coffee. These are just some of the complaints that our entire group had, across over a dozen rooms.
1 ||| The technicians were friendly, however, for them not being very busy, I waited quite a long time. It was nice they did not try to up sell me on a million items. I only wish they had nitrogen for the tires rather than air. They should have referred me to a place that carries nitrogen instead of mixing both in my tires.
0 ||| This is the first time I've had sushi in Pittsburgh so I can't comment on how good the food is in comparison to other sushi bars in the city, but generally, as a sushi place, Chaya is just okay. The prices were inconsistent, with some rolls costing $4 and others $14 and nothing in between. How is it that an eel roll costs $4, while a dragon rolls costs $14 when it is defined as \"thinly sliced avocado on top of eel roll?\" Maybe the roll is 3x the size of the eel roll? I don't know. Also, the tempura udon was a rip-off at $13 a la carte. \nI guess I would've let these things slide if I weren't so dissatisfied with their service. At the end of our meal, we had a couple cookies from the bakery next door (Allegro Hearth--highly recommended) and the server told us that outside food is not allowed and that they would be charging us $2/person for bringing it in. WTF? I understand their policy on no outside food, but how about a warning? And this isn't even like we brought in our own wine or a cake that they had to slice for us. We each had half of a cookie and it ended up costing our table the amount of 2 sushi rolls. Ridiculous.
4 ||| Good fun place to watch games while drinking and eating chicken wings or sandwiches.They have a good selection of wings and decent beer. I try different kinds of wings  every time  I go in but so far spicy garlic has been my favorite. This is a typical sports bar.
2 ||| I probably would have given it a 3 star rating (very trendy and spendy not a \"bistro\" see review by TT) but my date loved it so I had better give it 4 stars. I had the lamb shank which was more than slightly over done. The scallops were however excellent. The mussel appetizers were good but pretty hard to blow that. Service was solid but a little slow. I had the house french bordeaux wine which was also good. They also have a nice Sancerre by the glass. The bar area looked \"interesting\" and was moderately crowded with elderly Manthers all hooked up with women half there age. Oh that famous Scottsdale bar scene!  I may return for a cocktail or three :-)......
3 ||| very smokey.\npretty loud\ngood country line dancing. \ncheap drinks.\n\nTake what you want out of this review.
0 ||| I heard a lot of good words about this place but I ended up having a terribly experience here so forgive me if this review sounds like more of a rant.\n\nPerhaps I just caught them on a bad day, but even still, it was quite possibly the worst Chinese dining experience I ever had.  I went on a Sunday at around 5PM. The place is really dark inside and i wish they had more lights on (Since there are lots of lights that were turned off).  It felt like a bar inside. \n\nThe hostess was very nice, but after about 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order, or heck, even bring me water or tea, I was starting to get frustrated already.  There were only about 4 other tables occupied, and I was wondering what the holdup was.  Eventually the hostess came back over to me and asked if I was still waiting to get my order taken.  I said yes, no one has come yet.  She said she would take my order and give it to my waitress. \n\nI was thinking, why can't my waitress just take it???  Regardless, I gave my order to the hostess, and she walked to the back of the room where my waitress was sitting the whole time reading a newspaper.  (Maybe she was on a break?)  She gave the order to her, and this somehow turned into the hostess screaming across the room to me.. \"What did you order again?!\" \n\nI was appalled but regardless I yelled back my order across the room.  Apparently, she couldn't hear and yelled again and asked if I said chicken or pork.  I was getting really bugged.  This is not the way ordering should work.  *facepalm.   I said chicken loudly across the room again, and finally I see the hostess go into the kitchen with my order, not my waitress! \n\nThe hostess brought out my soup, and i asked her if she was going to be my waitress and she said no, \"I'm just the hostess and your waitress is back there.\"  To make matters more confusing, a different waitress brought me my tea I have been waiting on.  I was regretting my decision to come here, but the soup was actually OK, and despite the horrible service thus far, if the rest of my food was good, I would be happy. That's all i wanted after all, just some good Chinese food.  \n\nI had ordered the Peking chicken, but I saw my waitress bring back something that definitely didn't look like Peking chicken (since its one of my favorite dishes other places) and when she set it down on my table, it looked and smelled horrible.  I asked if it was Peking chicken, and she said yes.  Anyway, the smell was really nasty.  Somewhat like a strong ketchup smell, and unfortunately, it tasted even nastier.  The chicken was extremely fatty and I couldn't even guess if it was chicken.  I really don't think it was.  The sauce it was swimming in was horrible too and like its smell, pretty much tasted like a strong concoction of ketchup and sugar.... It was the most horrible thing I tasted I couldn't finish more then half of it, and they don't give you much at all. \n\nIf I had liked the dish, I would say it was very under-portioned compared to what you are used to getting at Chinese restaurants. At the end of my meal, I had such a horrible taste in my mouth, I just wanted to leave as soon as possible, chew gum, brush my teeth, or purge myself.  It was that bad. \n\nBut I needed my bill.  Likewise, no one checked on me my whole meal, and now no one was bringing my bill.  My waitress was still sitting in the back of the room reading the newspaper, so i alerted the hostess to get my bill, and she went to the back of the room, got the bill off the waitress and the hostess brought it back to me!  What the heck!  My waitress didn't do anything. \n\nI left and slipped the hostess a few dollars, and I'll never go back again. Worst Chinese food I ever had, bad service, and under portioned. I don't say this often since people have varying opinions on what is good, but I really would say avoid this restaurant.
0 ||| Employees too concerned with chatting behind the counter other than offering to help you.
3 ||| Paper Skyscraper is almost like a sight-seeing stop. In a city with antique stores dying out, this mod collection of odds and ends gives you the same fascinating \"forrages\" without the tetanus shots.\n\nSeriously, name a category and there's a section of the store dedicated to it. There's a solid cooking section with appliances and hip cookbooks. I've never seen an architecture section bigger than a few volumes, but interior design dorks will love here. They manage to cater to every possible quirk and taste, and hanging out there is often essential to a trip uptown.\n\nMy issue with the place is some of the prices for items that look great on the shelf but might be out of place in my home. Nevertheless, it's a challenge to resist buying something. I feel like there's a magnet installed in the store that's attracted to my wallet.\n\nIf I'm by the East/West Blvd. light rail stop, I almost always swing by the store. That magnetism has a strong pull.
3 ||| Let me just get this out of the way. I grew up in Madison and for years this was my favorite Mexican place. I thought it was the best possible place...anywhere. Then I moved to Phoenix and had real Mexican food and now....\n\nI wanted to review this place because it's not as bad as some of the other reviewers are making it sound. Their salsa and chips are fresh and some of the best around. They serve you fresh warm tortillas with your meal that go well with anything. Some of the pre-meal quesadillas are fantastic. My favorite dish here is the Bean Burrito with red sauce. The way the beans and cheese are melted together just makes it so craveable. \n\nStill, a lot of this food is simply not authentic, and more than a few are on the heavy side. You will walk away feeling full and likely be on the toilet for a little while the next day. There is no way around this.\n\nThe simple truth is that there is no superb mexican food here in Madison, and Pedro's fits right in to this muddy amalgam of mediocrity. Some things it does well though, and the cheap drinks on a Thursday night usually make for a good atmosphere.
0 ||| They advertise \"you don't need no teeth to eat our meat.\" Well, yes you do! I bought a full rack of baby backs and couldn't wait to get home with them. They were VERY tough... and had very little meat on them.
4 ||| This tiny little thrift shop is not the biggest or the best, but it certainly supports a good cause.  I come here to donate my old stuff because it all goes to a good cause.  The ladies who I have met working at the shop are nice as can be and will do anything they can to help.
0 ||| First time I flew with them, and I have to say I encountered the most rude employee at the Phoenix airport. \n\nThe airport was completley dead and I wanted to see if my mileage got added to my ticket. I noticed there was a worker on the phone for 30+ minutes at an empty gate that I was waiting at, so I finally walked over. And waited. Another passenger asked me if I was waiting and that finally cued her to ask her what I wanted. I told her (while she was still on a personal call) and she quickly took care of what I needed with attitude. The customer behind me asked her \"se habla espanol?\" and she said no and told her to go to customer service next door. He asked where again, and she snapped and told her NEXT DOOR! YOURE WELCOME! Then she hung up the phone and muttered a bunch of crap and left. \n\nIf you hate your job that much then find a new one!
4 ||| Use to go here all the time for lunch. Always crowded at lunch time. Everyone that worked there was very friendly.  Had good fish sandwiches, great fried okra and fried chicken wings (big ones). And yes, it is a hole in the wall.
1 ||| Love the price of cigarettes, but as soon as I walked in the door an older women workin there stairs at me then walks up asks me for I'd so I went to hand it to her and she snatched it out of my hand. She then gave me a very dirty look because my I'd is a California I'd. I walk up to counter to tell the other girl wat I wanted, and she had an attitude as well... Prices are great, but the people that work there are extremely rude. I'd rather pay the extra 3$ and go to a gas station.
1 ||| I know that saying something negative about this place is like calling your baby ugly. With that said, I think we may have an ugly baby here. Don't get me wrong, there are some redeeming factors here, but for the most part I think that there might be a bit more hype than anything going on these days at La Grande.\n\nI went here for lunch today not recalling that 50% of their menu is not available 100% of the time and that kind of bummed me out because that means no pizza until 4 pm during the week unless it is Friday or Saturday and no burgers unless it is Friday or Saturday.  Either way, 11:15 am on Wednesday means I have a full choice of sandwiches, pastries, salads, and breakfast choices.  Many will say that those choices should be more than enough to choose from if I am willingly going to dine here.  Well...it wasn't my day to pick the lunch spot.  A work colleague actually picked it which is amusing due to my second gripe: between the loud music, gabbing hikers, lunching ladies on their way to or from the Biltmore or Fashion Square, the place doesn't necessarily lend itself to normal conversation.  That is assuming there is a place for everyone to sit. Just because you are alone, with your latte and laptop doesn't mean that you need to take up an entire 4 top to yourself.  The place itself and the atmosphere just doesn't feel as \"phoenix\" as I recall when I first went. Something has changed. I feel like all of the LA transplants come here to recharge and then go off again to do their thing. It only made me laugh harder when I was leaving the restaurant and noticed the sign on the door that read \"LGO now open in Santa Monica.\" Yahtzee! That is exactly where I thought I was anyways during lunch so I guess it makes sense that they opened another one out there.  I also think that the flow can be improved from finding parking, to the ordering, to the waiting at the end of the counter for your food, to finding a seat.  I would think for all the hassle I was going to get served a plate of food that was made from the water of the fountain of youth or at least a hint at the secret of life.  But alas my $8.00 tuna salad sandwich only came with a couple of pickles and a watermelon wedge.\n\nWhile I will say one of the redeeming is the food (although an $8.00 sandwich has to be pretty damn fantastic to be $8.00). My tuna salad on 9 grain was fresh, not too much mayo or other junk in it.. It is served with tomato, cucumber, apple and greens. I will be honest, the tuna is stacked high, but the bread is overly toasted and I hardly tasted the apple. But I repeat, the tuna salad itself was pretty good.\n\nI know when I first tried La Grande I liked it a lot. I thought the breakfast was great and I truly enjoyed the scene there. These days it just seems like it has lost a bit of it's luster for me. I am sure I will be back in the future and will give it another chance. It will probably be when I can get dropped off, have called in my order ahead of time and it is between the hours of 4 and 5 pm on a Friday so I can freely order from the entire menu.
0 ||| I had 2 options for water a tiny 6 oz cup (yeah right) or pay full price (cost of pop) for a glass of water. Customer service is lost on the managers here. These are the basics and I'm tired of it.
0 ||| First off, there were very few cars in the parking lot at dinner time on a Wednesday evening.  Red Flag.  We went in anyway to give Coco's a chance, even though I had had a bad experience the last time we went there. When my wife's soup finally arrived, it was the wrong one.  She finally got the correct flavor, but it was room temperature.  Followed by the cheeseburger and fries which were also room temperature.  When we told the waitress, she took the plates away and said \"oh\".  To her credit, she did not charge us for my wife's dinner.  Upon paying the bill, the manager asked us \" how  was everything\".  We told him our experience and he was really surprised as he had prepared our food.  Coco's has lost their spark, and we will not return there in the future.
4 ||| I was skeptical when my cousin asked me to go to pizza....at 7th St and Bell (we live in Central Phx).  I thought she was a little nuts to drive so far for pizza.  But YUM!  The place ain't fancy.  And the wine is from a really big jug.  However, the pizza was fantastic!  Excellent crispy crust but not at all burnt.  Lots of toppings!  I took some home despite my cousin's protest that the crust wouldn't be as good.  But a few moments in the toaster oven and I had a great leftover.  \n\nI will be back!
1 ||| Takara is very uneven.  Sometimes the food is very good.  Other times the service is surly and unpleasant.  At times, late in the evening, it is noisy with lots of loud drinking games.  The last time we were there we were so disappointed we have not been back.  Better sushi in other places in Madison.  And better treatment of customers (in my view)
4 ||| Stopped in for lunch on Saturday and this was the first time here. Service was excellent! Informative and helpful. We ordered the 2 specials to go and were out the door in 15 minutes.  The food was excellent. We had the lau lau and Hawaiian plates.  I was skeptical of the cabbage side dish but it was so full of flavor! Very nice surprise for a hole in the wall place inthe neighborhood.
4 ||| We have stayed at Boulder Station three times over the past couple of years.  Recommended by family that lives in Vegas.  For the most part, good value for the price, except our last stay, which was nascar weekend and prices were very inflated.   That is to be expected, but our precious stay was 3 nights free, so quite a difference, depending on when you travel.  \n\nRooms - average rooms, nicely decorated.  Nothing extraordinary.  Showers are hit and miss as far as whether you get hot water for the entire shower.  That is very frustrating.  2 out of our 3 stays, we had noisy neighbors who came in to their rooms in the middle of the night and made LOTS of noise.  First time, we called security and they quieted down for about 10 minutes before the partying/yelling/cursing continued.  Other loud neighbors were not partying, but, let's just say we could hear ALL of their private time and even talking in just conversational voices.  This lack of soundproofing between rooms is annoying.  We noticed on our last stay that the housekeeping staff was very chintzy with the toiletries.  One bar of soap that we had to share between sink and shower and they didn't replace the soap until our last night there (we stayed 5 nights). \n\nCasino - large casino with lots of variety for slot machines.  Table gaming area was great.  I didn't have any trouble finding a $5 blackjack table any of the times that I played.  Dealers were very friendly.  Cocktail service was mostly prompt and accurate.  Only downside for me was the smoke.  Even with no one at your table smoking, the casino seems to be very smokey.  Better air flow would definitely help the atmosphere. \n\nBuffet - great food, especially for the price.  Lots of variety.  Only $4.99 weekdays for breakfast buffet.  \n\nGrand Cafe - good food and great service.  Ate both breakfast and dinner here several times.  Great dinner specials and excellent food.  Also a great dessert case for the times you want to take a dessert back to upto room to enjoy later.  \n\nViva Salsa - good, inexpensive Mexican fast food.  Loved the fresh cilantro that they had in the garnishment area.  \n\nPasta Cucina - great atmosphere.  Good food and good prices. \n\nPool - we haven't used the pool but on our first visit, there were hundreds of large bugs (beetles?) in the area between the casino and the pool.  Nasty!  Did not notice any bugs on subsequent visits, so hopefully that was a one time thing. \n\nBoulder Station is conveniently located for us while visiting relatives.  Easy to get in and out of without all the traffic issues that you experience while staying on the strip.  The valet service was awesome.  We will definitely stay here again because there are so many good things going on here.
4 ||| If you want a one-liner, I had a really great time here with my friends and wife, but I do not think that Carowinds is a great theme park.\n\nTickets - Just like department stores, Carowinds largely overprices its tickets at the door ($55?) but has numerous gimmicky sales. For example, going to Bojangles can get you $15 off.  Various schools and hospitals have various discounts ranging from 50% off to only $10 off. You'll never feel like you got a good deal.\n\nParking - Preferred parking is $25 while standard parking is $15.  Preferred parking is basically designed for families that want to eat outside of the park for lunch or dinner and I would recommend it if you plan on coming in and out of the park.\n\nWeather - It rained just an hour after we arrived here. There are no rain checks or refunds. Most of the rides shut down until a good 30 minutes after the sun started shining. It can really put a damper on your day.\n\nRides - There are some pretty good rides and some really, really bad rides.  The log-ride is literally one slope.  Literally one.  If you don't know this beforehand, you might wait an hour to experience about 15 seconds of ride.  Drop-zone (I forget its new name) is literally one free fall for a couple of seconds.  Do not waste your time on these two rides. Good rides include The Intimidator and After-Burn which are both quite impressive.  You can expect to wait quite a long time for each of them but I would recommend waiting for a front-seat on each of them.  It's really a great experience to see the entire park from the top of the coaster and you really do get a great sense of flying on After-Burn. \n\nOne thing that really bothered me about some of the rides is that no one cleans the restraints, especially the overhead bars, and as a result, it's stained with the odor, oils and dirt of thousands of riders before you. As a result, my experience on Night-Hawk was not quite as pleasant as I would have liked. In addition, somebody should tell the ride operators that there is no need to speak loudly into the microphones because most of the time they're painfully loud and the speakers are distorting.\n\nFood - $10 minimum for any main entr\u00e9e, $4 for drinks, everything will gouge you. They don't allow ANY outside food or drinks. Prepare your wallets.\n\nExtras - The dinosaur park is $2.50/person for groups of 4 and it was kinda nice, but you have to really like reading (there's a LOT to read) and learning to get the most out of it.  The 3D movie about dinosaurs is included but it's kind of depressing, and doesn't have the cool gimmicks like moving seats or mist that Star Tours or Honey I Shrunk The Audience had. \n\nIn conclusion, I actually had a great time at the theme park with my friends and wife, mostly because we luckily came to the park on a Sunday that apparently wasn't very popular and thus didn't have to wait very long on any lines.  Had we come on a \"normal\" day, I probably would have been a little bit less happy.
0 ||| Upon reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to bring my parents here for lunch when we arrived in Vegas the first day - my parents are the type that only likes to eat Asian food - actually Chinese food to be exact and so I was obliged to find a good Chinese place in Vegas. It was about 2pm when I got here and they were still busy so I took it as a good sign.\n\nHowever, it didn't quite live up to what I expected.. I didn't have that high of expectations to begin with since I know we are in Vegas and it's not like they are known for Chinese food...but I didn't expect that poor of quality either.\n\nTo begin with - the service was okay - I mean I didn't expect much from an Asian place - and they only had like two waitress/waiter and it was busy - so you can imagine that they would forget to bring you things you asked for until you asked about 7-8 times. \n\nThe food was ehhh - I was kind of disappointed because on their online menu they offered Deer meat but they didn't have that on their menu when we got there - only the ordinary stuff - I really did wanted to try Deer meat with mushroom and sacha sauce but they didn't have any dish that offered deer meat so not sure what that's about.\n\nSo instead we order three dishes: Salt and pepper fried shrimp, clay pot chicken and pork crispy chow mein noodles. \n\nThe salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried. The clay pot chicken - didn't have a lot of chicken and the chicken was chopped up in very little pieces it was difficult to eat - there was more mushrooms than chicken. The only dish I thought was fairly decent was the pork crispy chow mein noodles - but then again it wasn't very crispy - they slathered the sauce all over it so it became soggy instead but at least the flavor was okay.\n\nOverall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.
4 ||| OMG! Why or why have I never been here before now. This place is awesome, in so many ways. First the atmosphere was perfect. A very casual feel. There's a bar that you can walk up to sit down order a great pint of beer. Second the waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable. Third the food all my God is so good.  The portion sizes are great. We will be going back definitely.
4 ||| Stick with things off of the grill.  Also the Pittsburgh style chili is top notch.  I nice place for lunch.
1 ||| The food is ok, but the people that work there could not give a rip. The one in Champaign is much better.
0 ||| Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced
1 ||| I'm not a big fan of Home Depot's in general and this one is no different. It's ok if you know what you want and where to find it. Customer service is almost non existent. They seem to cater more to the large volume contractor type customer than the home repair guy looking to buy a screwdriver. It has improved a little but they have a long way to go in my opinion. Their lumber selection is terrible. I could hardly find a single piece of wood that didn't look like a hockey stick. \n\nHaving said that, the prices are generally good and the selection is very good. Loews gets most of my business these days but your mileage may vary.
4 ||| Some friends and I hosted a baby shower at 300 East and had the BEST experience! We looked at having it at several places but one conversation with Mike at 300 East sealed the deal for us.  He was extremely helpful and responsive through the planning process and we were given a wonderful open area upstairs to gather.  Plus, unlike many Charlotte restaurants (read Amelie's), they did not charge us for the space! I highly recommend 300 East for a special event and will definitely host one there again.
4 ||| I needed to kill time while waiting for my car wax. Got some assorted sundries. Clean, nice staff
0 ||| Facility: 3.5 \nGroup Fitness: 0\n\nSeriously, if I could give this gym a zero, I would. Of course, my negative experience is only because of its garbage quality (yes-garbage) fitness classes. Have they ever heard of in-stru*cto/r cert#ification????? I figured out how they cut corners. it's simple. They cut all the really good instructors that take fitness seriously, and replace them with either wannabes or old retired women that are looking to fill up their time (I do not have a problem with old retired people btw but if I'm going to the gym, I better sweat! And that's not even that hard) Every class I've been to, the instructors obviously know nothing about toning, strength, or cardio. A little rhythm wouldn't be so bad either.... The instructors show up LATE.... or they don't show up at all. This gym only cares about its numbers. This goes for all locations. \n\nMy motto: G.I.G.O. Garbage in =Garbage Out.
0 ||| Don't come here for breakfast. \n\nI think we came here on an off day. Last Sunday was opening season for football, specifically this bar's affiliation - the Vikings. When we walked in, the place was full of Vikings fans getting ready to watch the game. \n\nWe ordered a breakfast burrito and two side salads. The breakfast burrito was not great. I thought it would be much bigger and the hash browns inside were undercooked, leaving it a little slimy. Salad was just salad, but their house homemade ranch dressing was amazing. \n\nI wish I could give this place more stars. Our waitress did her job, and that was it. She was unfriendly and didn't even ask how our food was. \n\nI would advise coming here unless you are drinking and watching football. Stay away from the food unless it's fried.
4 ||| This place was poppin! We had to park in the Dallas and Co. Parking lot cause the Parking Lot was full. The entire structure is pretty cool- they've been pretty successful with an attempt to 'Go Adobe'. \n\nOverall, the food though wasn't that great. I guess I might just have really high expectations for mexican food because I love it. I ordered their 'Mexican Combo Dinner' and got a beef tamale, chile con queso, chorizo enchilada and the enchilada was my fave..
3 ||| Ambiance was very nice. Service was really good. Very expensive which wasn't the worse part, the food was horrible. My husband just got chicken parmesan which so bland. The kids got basic spaghetti and hated it. They didn't like the taste.  I got some dish that had Angel Hair pasta, spinach and shrimp. Horrible!!!! The shrimp was horribly cooked and rubbery. Just not good food!!!
1 ||| Ok, first off, this place is ridiculously priced!  I know it's going to be inflated a bit, but I paid over $10 for a regular old cheeseburger combo.  I think I about fell over when my husband showed me the receipt!  As for the food, it was OK I guess, nothing worth that price to be sure.  Fair burger and pretty tasteless fries.  The service was alright, but it was almost empty to begin with.
4 ||| TJ Maxx has some great bags.. and some really nice bathroom stuff. ya know.. Soaps, lotions and bubble baths..This location is pretty nice and neat on the inside. \nI will visit again!
0 ||| DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING TO THIS PLACE TO BE REPAIRED. THEY ARE THIEVES. I took my Honda push lawnmower there because it would not start. They ended up putting a new carburetor on it and said it was fixed. I took it home it sat in the garage. I did not use it because I just moved and planted grass. I took it out of the garage to use a month later only to find out it would not start. I took it back called a few days later and they said water was in the gas but, it was fine now to come get it. I travel alot so, I had hired a landscaper to do my yard. I left the mower there for a couple of months they called, I said I would get it picked up. My son went to pick it up last week only to be told it was thrown away because it had a bad crankshaft that we must have hit a rock or something with it. So, since we took so long to get it they threw the mower away.
4 ||| Great bagels and good food! The bagels are a little small compared to true New York bagels (only reason for not getting 5 stars ) but are tasty and really good! Friendly staff and the restaurant area feels like a New York deli. I'll definitely be back for sure.
0 ||| Miss the old menu. New menu sucks. Bring back the old menu. This place is not the same anymore. Disappointed. :(
1 ||| 2 stars bcuz I like McDonald's no matter what but dang-- fast food does not equal bad customer service. We ordered big so naturally, you would think a big bag would be in order but no. carrying the bag into the house, it ripped. I ordered the #11 (Fish Filet) and it never fails that the fish is never centered on the bun. We asked for sweet & sour sauce n grabbing it out of the bag, my girlfriend found it to be open already! ick! :( bad experiences = less customers. Make sure everything is in order before you leave.
0 ||| I love a good chicken sandwich and ordered two of them for my brother and myself with a fry and a drink!  \n\nHis sandwich was fine and he ate it all!  However my other sandwich had some very nasty chicken and was extremely unappetizing for me to enjoy and I threw all of it out!  \nI was very displeased and called the new owner of the place the next day to let him know that it was a bad experience for me!  He said he would take care of it when I came in the day i called!   \nHe was extremely rude and seemed like he didn't want to refund my transaction so I just asked for another sandwich to try it again and he comped it for me.  This time it was ok and not as nasty!   \nI will never return to this place again and don't recommend it due to this experience.  \nThe fries and drinks were great though!  Horrible new owner!
4 ||| In Short: Awesome food, one of the best places for authentic mexican food in the valley.\n\nI've been going here for a while and I've never been disappointed.  It looks a bit sketchy from the outside but once you walk in, you're going to be pretty happy.  \n\nBefore you start the meal they'll bring a heap of fresh tortilla chips and two salsas.  I find the green one too sweet and the red one with pineapple lacks a real kick.  If you ask them they'll bring two other varieties one is about medium hotness and the other one is the habenero salsa.  Be careful with that one, it's really hot, but I find it if you mix that with the green salsa, it's pretty damn good.  \n\nI love their enchiladas, the monterrey enchiladas being my favorite.  They have massive burritos and chimichangas too, can't go wrong with most of the items on the menu.  It's one of the only places in the valley with a decent horchata, there's a just a hint of cinnamon, making it near perfection.  Definitely save room for some flan, it's so creamy and delicious, perfect way to cap off a spicy dinner.
4 ||| Had the stuffed cabbage. delicious!!!!!!! Side of veggies and water. Will definitely be back.
0 ||| Worst Studio in Vegas for sure.  I have been doing yoga in this town for several years now & this is the one that continues to find a way to irk me almost everytime.  It's not the instructors, they are amazing.  However, the management in these studios seems more intent on greedily making money than actually providing a quality yoga experience for their communities.  \nI wrote this studio off awhile ago, but then last year decided to give them a second chance & join a friend for a \"community\" class which was supposed to be $10.  When I went to pay with a credit card, they informed me I would have to pay $17 if I was not going to pay with cash.  So you want to penalize me for not paying in cash?  Um, a bit ridiculous don't you think?  After driving all the way to the other side of town, I paid it & enjoyed my class.  But I thought I'd never return.  \nThen this year, Groupon had an 8 class pckg available for a significant reduction in price.  One of my favorite instructors teaches there right now & so I decided to give the \"Sanctuary\" a third try.  I was not informed that I only had 30 days from redeeming the groupon with the first class to use all 8 classes, I was under the impression I had until the Groupon expiration date.  So when I showed up for my third class I was told my Groupon had already expired.  They were completely unwilling to work with me.  So I left, drove down the street to Bodyheat Yoga & Pilates (an amazing studio btw) & paid even more than $17 for one of their classes.  For a studio like Yoga Sanctuary to charge what they do when they do not provide adequate space for changing, showering, etc... is ridiculous.  \nAlso, if you work at night, you don't have much choice of day classes, they have a limited number available, & nothing in the afternoons on any day except Saturday.  \nMost importantly, the spirit of yoga is one of giving, one of a generous spirit.  I do not begrudge a studio trying to make a profit & run a business.  But if that's all you're concerned about, you will not profit for long.  And I, for one, will never go back after all this.  Strike 3, you out!
4 ||| The only good thing this restaurant has going for it, is their bar! \n\nThey have 22oz glasses!!!  and is very close to my job, which is great for an after work drink \n\nThe food is terrible I mean the worse of the worse, I am not a big fan of Italian food and it's because of restaurants like this!! \n\nOn one occasion I made the mistake of ordering food from this restaurant I had tortellini  in a tomato sauce,  I've had better Italian food from a can.\n\nMore is not always better the serving size could easily have fed six grown adults.
2 ||| I usually bring my lunch but forgot to today. Foregoing some of the places in the area I have been to more than once, I decided to give this place a shot. Ok so when I go in it is almost 2pm. I decided on the Gyro and the fries, no drink @ $7. Typical lunch prices. I ordered it to-go and ran back across the street to my office. The aroma of the fries drew in one of my cubicle neighbors. A generous serving I covered them with ketchup, salt and pepper before departing the restaurant. The tatziki looked like it had been sitting in its little container awhile, the gyro meat was dry and over cooked (sat around, rewarmed, IDK). The pita was tough like it sat, around too was microwaved and toughened up upon cooling slightly. \n\nBut I was hungry...and I ate the whole gyro and part of the fries. Now I wait...hoping that it all processes normally and not in the next 30 minutes. Wish me luck!
1 ||| Not good for vegetarians. They put meat in EVERYTHING. There is nothing like getting a \"vegetarian\" meal to find meat chucks floating in the sauce. In addition, every time I eat there I get sick. Seriously, the chain Mexican food restaurants need to be banned from Arizona. There are so many great authentic Sonoran Mexican food places around town, the chains just ruin it. Unfortunately none of them are by my house, so I am forced to try these crappy chains... When will I ever learn?
3 ||| We stopped in here late one Saturday night to grab a couple of emergency ingredients that I needed to prepare the dish that I was taking to a luncheon the next day.    \n\nAs we were walking in I noticed a young, smartly dressed Hispanic guy standing out front of the store with a gaggle of young ladies in tight dresses.  It was late at night on a Saturday and I didn't think too much about it.\n\nInside the store I noticed that it was clean and well organized.  We were able to find the ingredients that we needed right away, and at a reasonable price and checked out without any wait.  The clerk that checked us out was friendly too.  \n\nWe walked back to our car in the parking lot and after we climb in my husband says in a disgusted tone under his breath that he can't believe that the store management allows that to happen right in front of the store.  Being slightly buzzed from a few drinks earlier in the night I'm not sure I understood what he meant so I said \"huh?\" and he explains exactly what he means to me....  In incredulous shock I look back across the parking lot at where they are standing and look again.  Sure enough I now understand what he means; it was clear as day on second glance.   \n\nSo, I guess if you are shopping for more than just groceries at 11 PM on a weekend this is the place to come.  :/
0 ||| No more lettuce for my salad?  Well take your lazy butt to the back and chop up some more vegetables . What a bad customer experience. I will never go to the Chipotle ever again lazy late night crew
4 ||| This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\n\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \n\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\n\n-Fish Sandwiich\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\n-Flounder\n-Shrimp a few ways (\"Norfolk\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\n-Hawkins St Special\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\n\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.
4 ||| Phenomenal coffee and amazing people.  Coffee roasted in house and real, friendly people.
0 ||| Personally this car rental is a complete scam. From trying to con me into purchasing a car I was already being given and to also blame me for a chip in the windshield that was present when I received the car, it was a terrible experience. Also the employees are completely rude. DO NOT GO HERE
0 ||| Very little value.  We had been customers for the past 15 years.  Under it's current management it's a complete ripoff.
4 ||| Renovated with new equipment and big tv s. P25 program of 8 weeks is helping me to lose weight getting me to back to shape. It is convenient if you work in Phoenix Business Plaza and workout before or after work. The staff is knowledgeable and costumer oriented. Drew, the manager is great to work with. If you don't like crowed gyms and work around the area, this is the right gym.
0 ||| If you like dealing with people who have absolutely no personality, smack their gum, and with slower-than-necessary cadence say things like, \"...well, unfortunately...\" then this is the store for you. I needed something at the \"print center\" and they just couldn't be bothered. It was all about what they couldn't do. Believe me, I get that it's an office supply store, but come on, most of what they've got I can get someplace else and that exactly what I'll do.
0 ||| We did not have a good experience there.  Contrary to what the Saturn company is supposed to stand for, the salesman we worked with was extremely pushy (even for a used car salesman).  We won't go back.
0 ||| Very bad service. They are extremely slow. I waited 90 minutes even though there were just 2 cars in front of me. I bought the signature service which includes vacuuming which they didn't do at all. When I told them that, they just lied and said they did. Never going back here!
1 ||| Found Very Terry Contemporary Consignments over in Dilworth. Not much going on in here, a lack of great designer pieces and a small selection of handbags and jewelry. I did see a lot of items from Chico's, which I'm not into. If you are younger and looking for some great consignment pieces, head a few doors down to \"Sweet Repeats\".
0 ||| I work in the building across the street and have gone here for lunch too many times to count.  If I didn't work in the building across the street I doubt I would have ever gone into this corner building, strip mall, dive bar unless something horrific was happening in the world, such as the zombie apocalypse, one in which I'm being chased by a hoard and my only salvation is to enter a dive bar where, more than likely, the servers will also be zombies and I'll be fucked pretty bad. \n\nThat said, the place kind of smells like musk and sadness and the two or three middle aged servers look like they've lived a lot of life.  There are always a few hunched over dudes at the bar, watching sports or maybe counting their misfortunes.  One server appears to have always just had something weird or traumatic happen to her before she takes our order, like she was just bitching at SRP for shutting her power off or she just found out her teenage son got arrested on drug charges- then she comes to take our order.  While the service has never been despicable, we always have to wait an unnecessary amount of time for our tab, which sucks since we're anxious to get back to our meaningless jobs.\n\nShe also asks us \"what flavor\" of beer we want, which confused me since, like, Blue Moon is not exactly a \"flavor\" as much it is, you know, a brand.  But I can look past this.  \n\nI've eaten a few things here and the worst and most unacceptable was a simple dinner salad which was literally wilted Iceburg, bag lettuce with an obscene amount of dressing.  I can only assume that they thought if they covered the wilted lettuce with enough fatty Ranch I wouldn't notice the lettuce was bad.  I did, but I didn't send it back, instead I ate it and drank beer and talked about how much better the director's cut of Bladerunner is. \n\nThe wings are mediocre, not crispy enough for me to say they're cooked well, not thick enough to call them plump, and not tasty enough to assume that the sauce is anything more than some Frank's Red Hot concoction with some added butter or someshit.\n\nI've also had the pleasure of the chicken \"fritters\" which are, you know, frozen chicken strips deep fried.  I order these most times I come here because they can't really fuck it up and you can't exactly go wrong with chicken strips.  I've also ordered the \"fire\" fries which are just their fries with Cayenne pepper on them, and they charge another 1.50 for this. \n\nWhat IS worth the trip across the way and the shady, low brow atmosphere are the two dollar burgers on Tuesdays.  I actually never order the burgers only because I'm not much of a burger person, but my regular co-workers tell me they're tasty, a cut above a fast food burger and cheaper.  (Though, consider that you're also leaving a tip for the service, not getting fries, and paying extra for cheese, so it's not THAT much of a better deal than fast food, just sayin'.) \n\nWhat I can't look past, why Dirty Drummer is only getting two stars, is the fact that the only reason we came here; the five dollar pitchers of domestics, are now, for some reason, NINE dollar pitchers which, needles to say, is absolutely not worth it, especially considering the skimpy size of the pitchers, the depressing atmosphere and the tore up servers.  After my co-worker noticed this new four dollar addition to the pitcher price he said, rather cleverly, \"looks like this is the last time we'll be drumming.\"\n\nAnd it was.
3 ||| I've only had the Chicken Bun (pronounced boon) and the Chicken Salad. The food is consistently good and the ingredients are always fresh. My only gripe is that they are overpriced! The chicken salad is $9.78 and consists of a grilled chicken breast, shredded cabbage and carrots, cilantro, crushed peanuts and fish sauce.
4 ||| I am a real Chinese, so this flavor is all I'm being looking for in Glendale...we ordered several \"signature\" dishes for schzuan style on the menu, and there are definitely ups and downs here:\n\nThe cold dishes taste really good. We ordered beef tripes, and they're delicious.\n\nWe also tried the kidney, love it! The chicken in hot wok, love it! The steamed whole tilapia, you HAVE TO try it!!! Super delicious!!!\n\nThe water-boiled series are a little bit turned down for me. The taste is weird and there should be way more vegetables in the soup. \n\nIn general, pretty good place to have some schzhuan style food.
3 ||| The chicken Bryan is one of my favorite dishes in the whole city. I think it is absolutely incredible. The food servers are always amazing there  with a great attitude and friendly. I can't give them a 5 star because their red sauce is definitely lacking.
1 ||| Perfectly acceptable large moderately high-end supermarket. I disagree with the other posters that this store has a good selection of unique and specialty foods. Yes, they do have an olive bar and they often have produce you wont find at Wal-Mart or County Market, however, this selection is really not that great. If you have a specific need, I suggest calling around to Sunsinger, World Harvest, the Co-op, Art-Mart, or even Urbana Meijer before checking this Schnucks.  Their cheese selection is no better than County Market.\n\nOne thing I give them props for is their sushi. It is still crappy grocery store sushi, but for grocery store sushi it is as good as it gets. I suggest getting it around noon, and forget about the brown rice sushi- its terrible.\n\nThe prices are consistently higher here than County Market, Meijer, and Wal-Mart and IGA. The comparison to Dominicks of Chicago is apt in this regard, however I think that this store is not quite that high-end in overall quality. I peg Schnucks' around the neighborhood of most Jewel stores.\n\nLiquor/beer/wine selection is darn good for a grocery store, but they have a ridiculous booze policy: they card everybody you are with, so if somebody accompanying you doesn't bring their ID with them, they wont sell you alcohol. WTF?
0 ||| I agree with most of the other reviews: Skip this place. I had an issue with this location in the past (came in and waited for about ten minutes and finally left without anyone attempting to take my order). Given the location, I came back during the wee hours of the morning and received semi-decent service. However, after having a drink spilled on my by the person working the window; I have my limits. I received no apology (only a scared look in the guy's eyes) nor any napkins. Even after this, I gave the place the benefit of the doubt and returned only to receive food that has no rhyme or reason. \n\nAll-in-all: The food is never consistent and the service is so below par that it gives fast food restaurants a bad name. Skip this and hit the McDonald's down at the end of the block. Service there is what you'd expect from a fast food place and the food is generally consistent with what you are used to getting.
3 ||| Granted I don't have a need for speed, this wasn't the highlight of my day. If you're an avid go-karter then give this place a try. Just be aware that safety isn't exactly top knotch (which explains why you sign your life away).  They don't really teach you much but they do seem nice enough.
2 ||| Guess it's not my thing.\n\n\nI've  been to Mongolian barbecues in the past and the food has been okay to good , however Aj's Mongolian Grill falls short of being good or even okay.\n\nThe meats appear to be frozen and when cooked have a tendency to lack taste and are some what  grainy,  the noodles were gummy and I hate to repeat myself  but they to were flavorless.  The veggies are also frozen which causes the veggies to  lose a lot of their flavor when cooked. I realized after tasting my meal that I should have drenched my dish in sauce in order to get some semblance of flavor \n\nEven the ice cream for dessert lacks luster.  No toppings, just soft serve vanilla ice cream.  However, if you wanted crushed nuts to top your ice cream there  was a peanut dispenser that cost 25 cents. \n\nIf you decide you want to take your meal home that will cost you 75 cents for a carry out container. To be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks.   Maybe Mongolian grills are not my thing.
4 ||| My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!
1 ||| I had a craving for some Sushi and Miso Soup but when I called my usual, Ichi Ban, they said they didn't have Miso to go?  So I checked Yelp and picked  Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan.  When I called to order the guy on the the phone was a little curt with me but my wife said to chalk that up to the fact that they might be busy.  I asked for a Philly Roll and was told that they don't make those (I know, a Philly is not real sushi.  but I like it just the same) so I settled for a Salmon Roll.   I sent the other half to pick up the food and bring it home.  I have to say that it was just average and the rolls were kind of small.  We spent about $20 for 3 small rolls (6 pieces each), 2 cups of miso, and some edamame.  \n\nAll in all it was OK but in the future I'll go for good Sushi rather than OK.
4 ||| Way better than aiellos and mineos and everything else. I've lived in squirrel hill for 5 years and I can tell you that the delicious pizza smell making this neighborhood smell fantastic is coming from Napoli!
4 ||| Looooved this garden, it was very beautiful and peaceful, I couldn't stop snapping pictures. I was in luck because they had the butterfly exhibition, I felt like I was in a butterfly wonderland. :) great place to get inspired and have a peaceful walk.
0 ||| It's been a few years since I banned this place after experiencing hostile service and later found out that they fraudulently charged my credit card for an underserving tip!\n\nI wanted to give them another chance. \nAs soon as I was seated with my husband and 7wk old baby, I wanted to wipe Lysol all over the table and seats. The place is very run down. I don't think they have done any upkeep since ninteen-forgotten. \n\nThe servers were surprisingly friendly. We ordered the oxtail hot pot which was served warm in a steel bowl and the fried salted prune pork ribs which looked more appetizing than it tasted. We barely ate half of what we ordered.\n\nTo cleanse my tortured palette, I took a gulp of my hubby's Coke. Everyone knows I don't drink soda...   \n\nForgive and forget? Not!
0 ||| first off, we walked in for a bigger table (6) and watched the manager, who didn't address us at ALL, make the host who had an injured arm put together 2 tables and rearrange the chairs without any help. The manager even made eye contact and still couldn't even say hello to us or the 2 people behind us waiting as well.  The server provided great service and the beer was good. The food was another story. The burgers were over done and the personal pizza was burnt on the bottom and missing cheese from a whole slice. I made pizzas in a deli for a few years and I must say I don't know how you can do that but there's a first time for everything. The house salad was 90 % white and 10 % green, weak! All in all the pizza got replaced and taken off the bill but was that enough to entice a return visit? Maybe for a beer.....
1 ||| Another solid turkey sandwich and this places uses Boars Head and gives you three turkey flavor choices. All sandwiches include a pickle and your choice of sides. All the salads though are not homemade and come via Boars Head. Just pick the bag of chips to be safe. The signature sandwiches are about 8 bucks and those apparently include double the meat, but it really just looked like a normal sized sandwich. The make your own sandwich is a buck less. Very friendly sandwich maker and the bagels do appear to be boiled before baking, so that is a plus, except charging $1.10 for a bagel and then adding extra for a specialty bagel is a bit overpriced. All bagels should be 99 cents, crossing the dollar mark has gotten under my skin.
4 ||| Dana was fantastic.  He was informative and knowledgeable and made us feel very comfortable.
4 ||| This review is for the buffet only!   The pasta is what has kept me from  coming back every time I am in Las Vegas!  Keep up with all the good works...Chefs....
4 ||| This place has everything!  Popped in for lunch with a friend and a drink or few.  We sat at the bar in the center of the place and spoke with the very friendly bartender for suggestions.  She suggested a sushi lunch plate which we ended up sharing and the drink special.  Since the sushi chief worked right behind where we were stationed we got to watch the whole plate get created.  After a few rounds of the daily drink special we walked out tipsy and full for around $10 each, now that's a great lunch date in my book!
0 ||| \"Danny's car wash\" aka \"West Valley Auto Glass Repair\" is kind of sketchy. I called in advance the \"West Valley Auto Glass Repair\" and was told I could come in a 9 am and it would cost $40. In the morning, I called Danny's  to say I was coming in at 9 am and they said the glass man came in at 8 am so there would not be a problem. I arrived at waited for a half an hour for a manager to come to the front desk no avail. The glass man had never checked in and it was questionable if he would ever be there according to the receptionist. I went outside and asked a washer where the manager was. The manager came immediately and introduced me to none other than the glass man! He said they normally charge $60 but would fix my window as a cash job for $30 and repair any new chips...worked for me but unfortunately Danny's now has the crediblity of the old \"auto\" place across the street from my apartment in the Bronx. Best of luck!
2 ||| AWESOME!  Quickly made.. \nSuper burrito or tacos, is my menu choices.
4 ||| I just had them here to install a new fridge and take away my old fridge they were very nice and the first thing they asked is if we have any dogs or cats so he could shut the door. They came out the next day and gave a call prior to arriving. I would definatly recomend them again.
3 ||| The Inn-Termission is a total dive, but it's in the thick of the Southside insanity. Don't expect dive bar prices, or that friendly dive bar service.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of the service at the Inn-Termission. You'll often have the bartenders looking at you (or ignoring you completely) as if they're doing you a favor. Mondays are okay, as Tommy is working, and if you wander in when it's completely dead, your experience will be good. Just don't be surprised if service is a little frustrating if you're not a regular.\n\nIn the dive bar spirit, clean bathrooms (or clean anything, for that matter) don't exist, and smoking is permitted, so thumbs up if you're a smoker, but the rest of us will be thankful for the fresh air when we leave. There's often live music on hand, and certain Mondays have kung fu karaoke, where there's an old school kung fu movie playing on a projector behind you. It's supposed to be a great time, as a lot of my friends go, but I can't deal with the smokiness to start my week.\n\nIn the end, the Inn-Termission's name is pretty on-point. It's never going to be the place that you go as your primary stop for a night in Southside, but it's a decent option for a place to stop in and buy a drink on your way to your main destination or in between bar hop stops.
1 ||| Their Viva Las Vegas Roll is always good, but the service always leaves you with a bittersweet taste. \nWe don't plan on going back!!
3 ||| I tend to go for cheap when I travel alone, and don't expect much, but this stripped down stucco bunker managed to disappoint. The toilet was clogged, the ice maker didn't work and the promised free wireless is only available in the lobby.\n\nI had to wait to check in to listen to the strange and sad story of a woman who prepaid, got stranded in a snowstorm, and somehow the motel managed to both cancel her reservation and keep her money.\n\nAlso, the location is really inconvenient... in the middle of no man's land halfway between downtown and the Strip and hard to get to from anywhere else in Vegas. I'd mistakenly thought this was at the other end of the Strip, close to the airport, where there are also some budget hotels. Go there instead.\n\n(Update: I'm writing this review in the lobby, since that's where the wireless is, and somebody is on their cell phone possibly booking for an adult film shoot. I can only hear the one side of the conversation and it goes like \"we're doing a shoot tonight... internet... man/woman.\" That's Vegas, baby! )
4 ||| I will only spend my $$$ at this Lowes!!  Kristian, Julie and stefani are incredibly nice and provide great customer service!  The no hassle return policy was just that - no hassle!  Thank you - from your loyal customer!!!
2 ||| Tip: Need to be sober and coherent before eating at a late night joint such as Pho Kim Long.\n\nHad I had some reasoning and a little rationale I could have just stuck with their specialty...ie...the pho...duh...it's in their title name. But I went with a random picture in the menu, the roasted chicken with seasoned rice #38.\n\nAgain pictures do help especially if you're drunk, but the actual meal was nothing like the picture in the menu. The rice was super dry and the chicken was not good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=yBVkwiixnbBbSMCEUaHOnQ\n\nBut hey...it's in the menu and this restaurant is responsible for its contents. So just because they're specialties are pho, they should still put in some effort for the less frequented menu items including the roasted chicken and rice that I had ordered. Word!!!!\n\nNo doubt, I'll be back....and no doubt I'll be drunk again. But hopefully I should have my mental notes in place and some rationale fortitude to order the good stuff next time. Still, you can't beat the open 24 hours a day and family style dining in this Vegas off-strip restaurant.\n\nTheir name is funny too...word
2 ||| The Lupies in Huntersville is a 5-star burger joint. The one on central is a 3. Their burgers weren't as good as I've had in Huntersville and the building is a bit run down.  I know a lot of people that love this place, but I guess i'm just not a fan of seeing dust and spiderwebs everywhere.
4 ||| This place is hands down the best bagel in Tempe, AZ... Have yet to find a better place even in PHX or Scottsdale. Great choice of bagels and even better cream cheese selection. \n\nYou can't go wrong with an everything or poppy bagel with their garden veggie cream cheese. Those are my go to choices. \n\nCheap prices, bagel sandwiches and paninis for lunch as well. If you're in Tempe make sure you check this spot out!
1 ||| Ok Indian buffet. You are brought fresh naan. Ask for more fresh. Don't bother with the soggy naan at the buffet. Potatoes were hard. But lots of chutneys and chicken dishes. The carrot halwa was not so good, its better elsewhere.
1 ||| I bought the Yelp deal on the way to the Ballantyne restaurant. After I purchased it, I realized that the coupon said it was for the South Blvd location, but it was listed as South Blvd, Ballantyne. The manager went ahead and let us use our coupon, but there was some major confusion and he took my iPhone for about 10 minutes.\n\nWe ordered appetizers, soup/salad and shared an entree. Our entree was supposed to be a chicken dish and it came out as a pasta that had a similar name. It was good, but not really enough to share with 2 people like the meat dish would have been. I suspected the waiter had just heard me wrong, but the bill came out for the chicken dish. I should have objected, but I didn't because they had already let us use our coupon. \n\nWe won't be back. The food was so so and very expensive for what we got.
4 ||| I had about 45 minutes before I had to meet some friends so I decided to venture into this museum and check it out.  It was free and had A/C so those were another two pluses.  The front desk people were really nice and helpful.  Note that if you have bags/a backpack, you have to leave them upfront.  \n\nIn terms of exhibits, you can learn about Wisconsin soldiers throughout the years:  the Civil War, WW I, WWII, and up to the Persian Gulf War.  I found the Civil War section to be particularly interesting -- I learned more about Wisconsinites' stance towards slavery.  I also enjoyed the media exhibits where you could hear Wisconsin soldiers talk about their experiences -- I think that was in the Vietnam war section.
2 ||| There are plenty of vegetable only dishes at Panda Express and this is no different than any other location. Check it out in 2010.\n\nConstistently fresh and flavorful.\n\nAlso today 3-10-10 - free coupon for Honey Walnut Shrimp\nhttp://www.pandaexpress.com/px/Facebook/HoneyWalnutShrimp_Wed031010.html
0 ||| Went there to watch NFL game.   Food mediocre at best and service was awful.  The only thing that could have made our waiter less attentive was if he had the day off. Stay away.
4 ||| The best Indian food and wait service I've ever had, from the complimentary papadums to the after dinner hot towel. Classy and very reasonably priced. Two nan orders, two entrees, for less than $40. Delicious!!!!!
0 ||| This is the least well run operation in all of Sonic's stores!  they lie, they play with customers shakes they do not observe health regulations for food handling.  DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!
4 ||| Similar to the most recent review, I have to preface this with a \"I know you're reading this and thinking 'why the heck did this person give a fast food chain restaurant a good review'\"... There's always a reason behind the madness.\n\nI dined here late-night after getting into Phoenix later-than-expected, due to a flight delay. With apparently nothing else in the vicinity open after 9:50pm on a Friday night, I strutted down Central towards JITB and got there at 10:01pm... their drive through was open, but I did not have a car and the employees were in the process of locking the front doors. One woman responded to my dad's and my attempts to get the attention of the staff and was kind enough to let us in and order some much-needed artery-clogging goodness. \n\nAs if this weren't enough, 4 nights later, our post All-Star Game hunger set in. Again, we arrived at JITB as they were closing up, but upon recognizing us as those lame Californians without a car, the staff let us in once more.\n\nSUMMARY: Service was excellent, staff are all friendly and quality people. Food was typical JITB, but might I say that Sprite I had felt extra cool against that 10pm, 101 degree heat.
4 ||| This place is a fun place for Lunch or Snack sandwiches are good and have fun names. I've gone here quite a few times.
3 ||| Well if you check and read my last review, I gave Dons a 5 star rating, but now I have to edit that.  Just to refresh I have been eating there since it opened.  Of course it was closed 3 years and I was glad it reopened.  Now to be honest there are other things to be considered when you choose to spend your money so Ill get right to the heart of why Im pissed off.  I put up with the lousy decor and an occassional spring in my ass and that they have not changed anything in 30+ years,, But that was all cool cause the prices were good and so was the food, but in 9 months they have raised their price 20 percent, why?  Those booths tables and everything in there has not changed in at least 25 years.  You see they think they have got the market cornered, so plain and simple its GREED.  Part of the alure of Dons was the good deal!  Who do the think they are,  Macayos,  Manuels, Ajo Als,  These are nice place with ambiance.  Dons is a dump, (have you gone to the restroom, it smells in there cause they have done nothing in years).  The new owners just are charging what the market will bear and if your all cool with that good for you, but I'm (at my age) tired of bending over and grabbing the ankles and Those new owners can Kiss my rosy backside.  Thanks for reading and for the few real people that get where I'm comin from I appreciat the hell out of you.  And thats  \"THE TRUTH FROM THE TRUTH\"  CIAU
2 ||| I worked at the Tempe Kinko's years ago, during which time an anarchist co-worker remarked:  \"We are the factory workers of the Information Age.\"  Profound?  It sort of is if management drops you in a baby blue monkey-suit and makes you don an apron.  Think about it.  Kinko's workers essentially perform the same routine task day in and day out in their stations (on busier days) for low wages.  It's Fordism transferred to the copy shop.  Like factory workers, we also employed the \"weapons of the weak\" (work slowdowns and discounts to customers to cut into corporate profits) to covertly express our discontent with our work situation.  That was then, of course, and this is now at a different store.  But I get it...the job sucks...big time...and employees are just going through the motions to a get a paycheck.\n\nWith that said, I am still not a big fan of this Kinkos, at least not late at night.  I guess they fake it less well than employees at other stores.  I have been in twice recently at night and the service has sucked.  Coming to the counter to help a customer appeared to be a sizeable burden for any of the number of employees behind the counter (part of this is due to a company policy that says that you are not to leave your station).  When one finally did make it to the front, little attempt was made to hide his lack of enthusiasm for the job and disdain for customers.  I'm not sure, but he may be on the graveyard crew.  That may account for something, since the Kinko's graveyard workers that I have known have been a little off.\n\nThe last time I went in to get resume copies on E1 (cotton paper with a watermark).  The guy took the order and processed it quickly, but he copied it with the watermark upside down.  I can't imagine that being a deal breaker in a hiring decision, but it could be one of those attention to details things that looks a little bad.  I sort of felt like a ass asking for my order to be redone with the watermark facing the right way, but I wanted a polished looking resume (which is why I went with the cotton paper in the first place).  In any case, the guy told me \"no,\" that it would be too much trouble to go through the sheets and face them the right way.  Having worked there, I know that you are supposed to make copies with the watermark facing the right direction and that it is not a big deal to do so.  If you make a mistake, all you have to do is flip the paper and do it again.  That was too much for this guy apparently.  As much as I can empathize with the guy for having to work behind that counter, I wish he would have shown a different way to express his dissatisfaction with the job.  It would have been much cooler of him to get back at the man by hooking me up then my effing up my order.
4 ||| If you don't like this place, you don't like any place.  If you don't have 300 bucks to spend DO NOT GO.  Food-EXCELLENT.  Service- EXCELLENT drinks-EXCELLENT.  Eating there is like being on a cruise.  It is by far the best resturant in Charlotte, maybe the USA.  I have been there 10 times and will continue to go.  BTW the valet parking is a nice touch.
1 ||| Places like this seem to have a really difficult staffing problem.  They just don't hire enough people to handle situations that can come up, and with printing and shipping it can happen a lot.  When I was there one lady was having trouble tracking a package and one employee was with her for about 15 minutes.  \n\nI had a color print job that I tried on the self service machines but it was smudging, so the guy guy offered to do it for me behind the counter and it took him a few minutes.  Again, that caused a longer wait for others at the counter.\n\nThe next time I went straight to the counter to get my prints, and the lady was obviously stressed out.  She aligned my pdf then helped someone else, then started my print job then helped someone else, then answered the phone, then cut my prints in half.  We all just got lucky that someone didn't need anything time intensive or else the whole process would have broken down.
0 ||| I've unfortunately been here 3 times because I live within walking distance.  Don't remember what I got the first time but it sucked - the second time I got nachos- HOW CAN YOU MESS UP NACHOS?  I don't know, but the native New Yorker knows. This time we came for wing night.  My husband liked it which is why I gave it an extra star.  Buffalo wings were okay, honey bbq wings were okay, buffalo ranch wings were the absolute worst thing I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  Tasted like salt and nothing else. My husbands beer was flat and he ended up giving it to the people next to us. Water was warm.  Restaurant was very hot. Service was not bad.   They replaced our wings when we told them it was inedible.  The waitress said she knows they're not good but a lot of people like them.  This information would've been useful YESTERDAY!  \n\nAlso, two dozen wings come with the smallest saddest celery sticks ever and no carrots
3 ||| My husband has been wanting to eat here for months ... his colleagues at work claim that this is \"the best restaurant in Charlotte\" and yet it's never quite made it to the top of our list. Finally, the stars aligned, we got a babysitter with a limited schedule and needed to eat close by and early ... so I grabbed a same-day Friday reservation on Open Table for Toscana. I was excited. I kind of got dressed up. I even wore heels. And then ... mehhh. I'm not sure that I will rush back. The hostess was nice, the ambience was pleasant, the white bean dip was incredibly delicious. But the actual meal ... not so amazing. \n\nWe split the calamari and an arugula salad. The salad was delicious. The calamari had to be salted - it was light and crispy but no taste. My husband and I both ordered fish - I had salmon, he had a trout special. His trout was very good and well seasoned. My salmon was too thick and not well seasoned. Again with the salt shaker. Hoping to have better success with dessert we both ordered dessert. Silly, silly us. The desserts were decent but they were huge. Of all the times we decide not to split the dessert... of course. My husband ordered the tiramisu and I ordered the creme brulee. Both desserts were simply too heavy. \n\nStrangely enough, while we were there ... we see my husband's boss and he says, \"This is the best restaurant in Charlotte.\" - in kind of a secretive, hush-hush tone. As I looked around the room, I noticed that we were just about the youngest people in the restaurant by 20 years. So... if you are over 50 and have lived in Charlotte for many, many years, this might be the place for you. I, however, prefer to explore the endless array of inventive eating options that Charlotte continues to serve up and save this place for the regulars.
1 ||| You know in the past I would have raved about Sweet Tomatoes but it is fast loosing my thumbs up! This is the 3rd time I've been to it and it has not had my favorite soup, Clam Chowder.  Also, their selection for their sides has diminished as well.  Today I even had to ask for butter, they asked what kind and then brought it out from the refrigerator and let me take one then put it back! What's with that? You have to ask for the butter now? \n\nWe also tried the pineapple upside down cake, eh so, so!  I just to love this place now it's moving way down on my list!  \n\nIt's still a great value for what you get, just needs to improve their selection for the sides and PLEASE BRING BACK THE CLAM CHOWDER!
0 ||| Customer service was pretty rotten. Almost all the staff were rude and impatient and the whole experience was generally unpleasant. I won't fly this airline again-not voluntarily.
4 ||| Despite being a model or two behind the regular Nike store found on the Strip, their prices are a lot cheaper here.  Coming from Utah, their models are still ahead of the Nike stores there.  I generally go through their shoe every 1-2 years, and this seems to be the place to pick up those bright and flashy attires.\n\nI never had trouble with service here unless she was trainee.  Military personnel also gets discount here, for the travelers and Nellis folks.
0 ||| Sigh.  I know I'm about to commit Champaign-Urbana blasphemy, but...\n\nI don't get the hype.
4 ||| I cannot get enough of this place. \n\nMy mother, aunt, and I used to meet here once a month to enjoy platters of Raw Kibbie,  Sleek, and all the Hummus and Pita Bread we could eat. My Aunt passed away about 4 years ago and my Mother and I just went back for the first time. \n\nThe food was still delicious. I cannot get enough of the delicious food. The Raw Kibbie is a must try: it's raw lamb meat and it is to die for. If you like Sushi, you'd like this.\n\nThe Sleek was prepared beautifully and the roving orders of Pita Bread just topped the whole meal.\n\nI am actually planning on grabbing take out from here for dinner at work tonight. \n\nLove it!
0 ||| Worst McDonalds in Vegas! Bad service consistently and sloppy made food. 3 trys and still crap. WTF! I am sure the hobo's panhandling outside could do better. They seriously must go out of the way to fuck things up. I just want to know what other McDonalds this Franchisee owns so I can avoid those also.
0 ||| Finally decided to create a yelp account just so I could rant about Republic Services. \n\nWhen we lived in Vegas, these guys were great! Service twice a week, relatively cheap, and they would take anything I threw on the curb. Even an old couch! IT wasn't until about 4 years after we moved out of state that the issues came up.\n\nWhen we left Vegas, we canceled the service, and everything was cool. We couldn't sell the house we decided to rent it out. I guess when a property is rented the owner is still responsible for trash. Trash bills supposedly kept coming, but no one ever got them. Republic Services never made any attempts to contact me, just kept letting the bills, liens, and court fees piling up. \n\n3 years down the road, our tenant is gone and we are trying to do a short sale on the place. My agent just happened to notice that there is now an $800 lien on the property. I contacted Rep Services and they said to cancel the trash service, I need to produce a final electric bill, showing power has been shut off (to verify the property is vacant). They keep citing the \"City Ordinance\" that required this (Its true, I looked it up. LVCO 9.08.210 paragraph (B)). I called NV Energy, since the power is under the tenants name, they cannot give me the bill, or even release it to Rep Services. So I have to track down the tenant (property manager was NO help- look for another review on them coming soon!) myself, get her to get a copy of the bill, send it to me, so I can send it to Rep Services. It took me months, but I was finally able to get it, now they are saying it's not the right one, it doesn't say FINAL BILL on it, etc...  I get the run around every time I call. Meanwhile, I'm still stuck paying for trash service at an empty house, and my short sale is being help up even more than normal because of this. \n\nWhat really pisses me off is that Republic Services has not make ONE attempt to contact me, send me a bill, or notice, replied to an email, nothing! I am constantly having to call to get updates, and of course, get a different rep every time. Whoever wrote that damn ordinance has got to be in bed with Republic Services, and should have put in a provision for GETTING a power bill if it is going to be required.
4 ||| Love this location! Very clean & the employees are polite & very helpful. \nThey have everything you could possibly need in a smoke shop. The prices are affordable as well.
4 ||| Loved! Boyfriend took me here for Valentine's day, they were packed. I thought it would take forever to get our orders. The server was really friendly and the food came out wonderful. Would love to come back :)
1 ||| Grade: B-\n\nGreat food but a very loud place. I prefer not to shout during dinner.
4 ||| Best damn chorizo, egg and potato burrito I've ever had.  Next to my grandmother's of course.
0 ||| I have gone to this Arby's a couple times and the last two times I have had issues when trying to use coupons. This last time, I tried to use our local Memorial HS football coupon card when going through the \"drive thru\" where you can get 10% off your purchase.  The worker said,  \"We don't accept those cards at this location. \" Of course,  I was surprised considering this is the closest Arby's to the HS (only 1/2mi down the road). She continued saying,  \"this restaurant is owned separately and we dont accept many coupons.\" So considering the food looks flattened when recieving it and as if they just threw it all together in a wrapper, I wont be going back to this location in the near future.
1 ||| It's a bit of a hassle getting into the restaurant's parking lot these days from light rail construction.  But that's probably just as well.  I'm not in a hurry to get back to Pho Bang -- so no biggie.\n\nSome respectable ethnic eateries aren't much of a looker when it comes to decor.  No surprise there.  But Pho Bang takes shabby and RUNS with it.  The floors are worn, and so are the classroom-like ceiling tiles.  \n\nWhen I walked in there was no greeter, or anyone around to direct you to a table.  I later see that two little old ladies were running the ship in what became clear was a family operation.  Since I wasn't sure about seating protocol I walked to the back counter where it looked like one woman was counting the cash register (it was only 7 pm).   She looked at me all confused and flustered.  \n\nIt wasn't that busy either.  Two tables in particular were messy upon my arrival - and were for another 20 minutes after that. \n\nI was finally sat at a table near their Best of Phoenix awards - all four of them.... from the late 90s!   Figuring that many Vietnamese places have popped up in recent years to make it more competitive - I didn't think much of it.  I noticed on the menu that Pho Bang is a chain with locations in Manhattan, Dallas and Houston - who knew?  \n\nI place my order of shrimp summer rolls and pork and veggie vermicelli noodle bowl and assess the scene - 3 tables at about 6 -10 mostly Asian and Hispanic people (some family, and some friends) each dining and laughing. \n\nTo make the atmosphere even more sketchy than when I arrived,  I notice this grey moving cart that was wheeled from table to table.  Servers here don't clear the table and take the mess to the kitchen - they just dump it in a cart and wheel it all over the restaurant until closing.  Nice, unsavory, and klassy.\n\nMy food arrives and the summer roll and dipping sauce tasted alright.  The roll was heavy on the mint leaves, but otherwise it was OK.  The noodle bowl was OK too.  Nothing to write home about.  The one I've had at a Vietnamese place in Chandler was much more flavorful.  I'm not a soup person so I'm not sure how the pho is.\n\nSo, there you have it.  An average food experience coupled with unsavory ambiance and so-so service.
4 ||| Grabbed a roast beef and cheddar sandwich for $2.99.  Pretty good and a true value for that price.
0 ||| Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \"bacon\" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.
0 ||| Food was bland and uninteresting. Even for cheap Chinese the food was not good. I ended up throwing it all away.
1 ||| This one is consistent every time I come to this restaurant.\nGood flavor, good service. \nOn occasion the fixings selection is a little \"off\". Brown lettuce and those tasteless winter tomatoes. But the good thing about a burger is that they are still good wiht just the basics.
0 ||| Fresh off a trip to Houston and back in town, my friend and I decided to stop by here to start the new mini-tour.  I have been visiting this location for about 3 and a half years and have completed two, almost three world beer tours. \n\nWhen I entered I asked for Adam, our usual server, as he does a great job (usually leave 25-30% tip as he is great). He wasn't in, so we were stuck with a server that I have had in the past who is \"so-so\". \n\nWe sit down and start watching the football game. He approaches and asks what we would like to drink. I respond with, \"We are looking to start the mini beer tour\". He explains how it works, we order the $3 beer on special and then he asks for ID. In Texas, they required me to surrender my Arizona License and they printed out a temporary. I present it to him and he quickly takes it over to the manager. \n\nI figured it would be a quick conversation as I have seen the same thing happen twice before and the manager recognizes its valid. It takes about 30-60 days for Texas to create and mail the license so I knew this could be a potential issue, but never go in the direction it headed. Much to my surprise, he comes over and says he cannot serve me. I responded, \"Let me talk to Summer\". (Summer is the manager, I have been coming to this location since she was a server and she had helped me at least a half dozen times over the years). I explained the situation with the driver's license and that I had been coming to this establishment for years. \n\nFirst of all, she didn't recognize me. When I tried to point out how long I have been coming here and that Adam usually serves my friend and I, all she said is, \"Adam is in tomorrow and he can serve you then. Unfortunately because this waiter asked you for your ID we can't serve you\". Does that make any sense?!?! So if I come in tomorrow with my ID and don't get asked for it, then everything is okay?!?! Something smells fishy....\n\nSecond, I flew back on a plane from Houston and cleared security to fly a plane with my temporary ID! Also, if law enforcement pulled me over my ID would be valid. Is Old Chicago holding its customers to a higher standard? And why will other restaurants accept the ID except for them?\n\nAnyways, I am going to call and ask for the district managers phone number and talk to him/her. I have been a loyal customer for years and do not believe this is how a person should be treated!
4 ||| This place is worth it for their Mexican-style Friday fish fry special. I usually don't like very bready batter, so I thought I was taking a bit of a risk when the menu said \"beer battered.\" But, I was really in the mood for fish and Casa de Lara pulled through. Crispy, fragrant, fresh, under $12, and lasted me two meals. Also came with fresh avocado, tots (?!), and well-seasoned rice and black beans.\n\nTo round it all up, their salsa and chip basket was fresh and refillable. Their Jose Cuervo 32 oz margarita pitcher special for $14.50 was strong enough for three people to responsibly enjoy and two people to less-responsibly enjoy. \n\nI'm almost glad I have to be on State St. every Friday now that I know this option exists. Al menos los viernes, la Casa de Lara es mi casa.
4 ||| A charming room, great atmosphere\n\nI have noticed the small bistro on Osborne for many years though never found the opportunity to dine there.  For a recent birthday dinner I was searching for French cuisine and narrowed my search to Sophie's and another well know eatery.  Yelp reviews for both where about equal, the deciding factor for me was the preference for a smaller quiet room, that would be more similar to the small bistros one finds in Europe.  I called for reservations and I was also notified that wine was half off (with 2 entries) on Wednesday. \nUpon arrival the gentleman sitting at the bar came around to ask 'table for two?', no hello or welcome did you have a reservation, no problem but didn't feel terribly welcome.\nOur server stopped to say hello and check on us.  We did start with a bottle of wine, and then asked for two appetizers, the moules and escargot.  We where then advised that the restaurant was out of moules, and the waitress suggested the p\u00e2t\u00e9.   The pate was about bland for our tastes, though the Dijon mustard on the side added a nice flavor, and enjoyed the crisp gherkins. Escargot where fine.   \nWhen ready to order entrees we asked our server which she recommended, the pork or beef Bourgogne, she quickly responded that she recommended the pork, and then also shared that she had never tried the beef.  \nThe pork was well prepared, presented and very tasty, our second entree the house special Duck Cassoulet was perhaps not quite as well prepared.  The duck was cooked nicely, crispy skin, didn't taste as though there was much seasoning, the beans and sausage where nicely done (not overlooked as reported by another reviewer).  \nWe choose not to try a sweet, though I was somewhat surprised that knowing that we were celebrating a birthday, that a small something didn't appear.\nNot surprising that when the check was delivered the wine was not half off as mentioned.  The waitress was quite pleasant about the error, but she did need help and had to find someone that could adjust the bill.  \nWe enjoyed our evening, though will not be in any hurry to return.
4 ||| So my parents came out to help celebrate my son's birthday. My son is a teenager now. While they were out here, we found this wonderful church which is closer to my home. The church is on a private lot, gated, and beautiful. The church is huge and gorgeous. When the sunsets, the landscape and scenery  just too beautiful to leave from. I could sit there and watch the sun set. My dad was concerned though because there were no pews. I told my dad that I'm sure they had the chairs out because it gave more room for folks to join and sit instead of having folks standing on the sides like most churches. The environment was diverse, friendly, and great. As you walk in, there is a gift shop to left. Different but unique. The ushers were friendly and helped you find a seat just before mass started. We do need to start practicing once again and go back to church. Soon soon soon.
0 ||| Just meh. I went for a diablito because I didnt want to drive to 59th ave  & McDowell. What I got cannot even compare to what I usually get at other places. The ice was like chips and there wasn't cacahuates or all the other mexican candies. I can't speak on any other menu items, but I probably wouldn't return considering there are water and ice and raspado places all over the city.
2 ||| I travel for business for 11years. I had my share of airports. CLT needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas. Need to expand the roads.
0 ||| Republic Services does not list telephone numbers on their website. What kind of service is that? I had to come to yelp for their telephone number.\n\nThey make it very diffult for customers; they really don't want to talk to you. I've seen this kind of unfriendly practice in many business. \n\nThey do have an email response screen, so they DON\"T want to talk to you. \nI am disgusted with business that hide behind the website and do not offer a phone number. \n\nThey have no competition in this area.... so try to abuse your customers more often, ok?\n\nArleen
4 ||| I wanted to like this place, I really did - especially after seeing a 2' x 2' advertisement for this place in Pittsburgh magazine, upon which after seeing I was hoping to come to some sort of tropical paradise with a volcano, some fire dancers, and maybe some strong pain in the ass drinks. \n\nInstead, my friend and I narrowly side stepped a huge mess of vomit to get into Tiki Lounge. We were slightly comforted by getting lei'd immediately upon arrival, but we weren't fans of the lounge in general. It's super small, and had to squeeze our way all the way to the back of the bar/lounge - which led to an equally small dance floor which reminded me of a dark room in a smoky frathouse  (wouldn't be surprised if Molly's were being passed around). The whole scene just made my friend and i feel uncomfortable so we took the advice of some other Tiki Lounger's who declared, we're going to Diesel. And so we did, and definitely the best decision of the night.
0 ||| Long ago, I worked at Harper's for a spring and summer after college.  Now every time I go, the smell of the place takes me back (something between wood-fired kitchen and just... kitchen).\n\nThis is another relatively safe place I can go with my parents.  Though their veggie options are scant, their veggie burger is made in-house, I can get their six cheese penne without bacon, and I've always enjoyed their pimento cheese dip.  \n\nUnfortunately, I found little to eat for lunch yesterday.  I was looking for something light, and save ordering a salad (sans meat, of course), there wasn't much else on the menu that appealed to me.  I do love a good bowl of soup, but Harper's rarely has a veggie soup on tap, and yesterday was no different.  I ordered the spinach quesadilla, hoping it would be more spinachy than cheesy and thinking it's hard to eff up a quesadilla.  Right?\n\nWHAT a disappointment.  The quesadilla was a total mess, stuffed to the brim with a slurpy cheese mixture.  The filling was incredibly uneven - one triangle had cheese with just a hint of spinach, another was filled entirely with the spinach mixture (which I am 99% sure is just their spinach dip repurposed), and another had a surprising number of cold, mealy tomato cubes.\n\nPer the usual, my dad ordered a small cup of soup, and the server barely hid her disdain at our tiny order.  The sneer was palpable.\n\nI think I'm done with Harper's for a while.
4 ||| We were up late and were craving some food.  We did not want to have the run of the mill Dominos or other national chain.  We looked on Yelp and found this place.  We called and told them to put whatever toppings they thought would taste good.  They put on pepporoni on one and sausage on the other.\n\nThe pizza came quickly and was also really good (for delivery) and was much better than any chain pizza.  Also, the price was really good for 2 pizza (like $16), and the pizzas were bigger than I was used to.  We had leftovers for lunch (nothing quite like leftover pizza - unless it's leftover chinese food).\n\nI would order from here again and recommend it to others.
2 ||| I agree with another poster on the review about Village Pizza being compared to Dominos. I have to say tag lines of \"Real Italian Food\" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately, I was let down. There is nothing authentically Italian about this eatery. Staff was upbeat and nice , pizza buffet was sparse and pizza looked old. It was right around dinner time , so if anything, that's when the buffet should  be stocked with choices.  We ordered a pizza with meatball and pepperoni, and a side of mozzarella sticks. Sauce was decent and sticks were good, toppings were fresh. It's convenient, if you live in the area, but I don't understand all the hype.
1 ||| Every thing is over priced compared to many other stores that sell the same things
4 ||| 5 star cheap breakfast!! I give it 5 stars because going in I know what I am getting.   This a 2 egg, meat, grits/hashbrowns, toast/biscuit type of place.  Yes sure they have pancakes and french toast but most of the people are eating the $3.99 special.  I eat here quite frequently because it is cheap, convenient, and it taste good!  Oh and when you come, if you are getting a tea or coke then you can bring your own cup because they give you a small styro cup that just gets your mouth wet... not quench your thirst.
3 ||| I was turned on to Neds when I was in High School and am a fan. Its a good value. I believe the last time I went, an 8: sub with side and drink was like 5.00. Wayyy better than subway. I like just the traditional turkey sammich with lettuce, tomato, onion and lots of mayo. The reason they are not rated \"as good as it gets\" is because every time I have gone there, there is not enough mayo on the sammich. Make sure you ask for extra unless you want a dry sub. Their potato salad is terrific and might be the best I have ever had. The service is quick and friendly and the facility is clean but a bit plain. Give it a try if your looking for a new sammich spot. \n\nPS: Their catering is great too. They always include everything and instead of giving little packets of mayo, mustard, oil, vinigar, they give you actual bottles.   :O
4 ||| Delicious desserts! \n\nWe only came here for desserts, in which we got the cookie dough eggroll and the carrot cake.  I agree with another review that the carrot cake tasted like it was in the freezer. However, the cookie dough eggroll was AWESOME..rich but awesome. :) Will come back again!
3 ||| If there is one thing I know... it's Mexican food.  I love me some Mexican.  But I was not real impressed with this place.  I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  I had the chicken tacos.  They were OK.  I liked the salsa bar.  Overall, it was an \"OK\" experience.
4 ||| First time going...and I LOVED IT! Great service, tasty food, and a \"hometown\" ambiance. I'm not from Pittsburgh, but this place definitely made me feel at home. The portions are huge! My only regret is that I didn't try to split a meal w/ my girlfriend.
0 ||| DO NOT GO HERE!! I cannot stress this enough...do not go here.\n\nI own a Toyota that I took into this shop awhile back to have the brakes looked at. I did not have an appointment so I arrived early at 8:30AM. It was made very clear that I needed the car back by 12:30pm at the VERY latest, and if this was not possible I would be happy to take bring it in later in the week. Alex assured me the car would be done by 12:30pm several times before I left my keys with him. At 12:30pm I called to make sure the car was ready before I arranged for a ride to go back to the shop, at this time I was told it was not ready and they would be an additional 30 minutes to finish. At this point I was upset, but was able to reschedule my meeting from 1:00pm to 1:30pm with my client. At 1:00pm I arrived to the shop only to find that my car was up in the air, tires off, with no one anywhere near it. When I asked Chandler why the car was not ready even though I was assured by Alex it would be done before 12:30pm he told me they just had to put it back together and that it would be done in a few minutes. Twenty minutes later (1:20) I approached the desk again and asked Chandler what the status was on the car. He again told me that it would be done in just a few minutes. I reminded him this is what he told me nearly half an hour ago and asked that he check the status with the mechanic before quoting me a time. He said he would go to the back and see what was going on. At this point, I called to reschedule the appointment with my client to 2:30pm. I waited for another fifteen minutes (1:45pm), and Chandler was nowhere to be found. I literally had to walk around the building to find him in the back, speaking with two other staff members smoking a cigarette. Again, I asked what the status of the car was. Chandler told me it was going to take at least another hour or so to be finished. When I asked Chandler why he was standing around in the back and didn't come back into the store to tell me it wasn't going to be just a few more minutes when he knew that I have needed this car since 12:30pm to meet my client, he had no response. I asked for a manager and was told that one wasn't available but that someone would call me. At this point my client had cancelled on me.\n\nAt nearly 3pm the car was put back together and returned to me. Also at this time I was told that they were not able to fix the problem and that I owed $149 even though they didn't fix anything. The cashier stated that the problem was partially fixed and I will be charged for the full amount but they were not able to tell me what had been fixed. After approaching the first stop sign upon leaving the shop it was apparent the problem had not been fixed at all, not even partially.\n\nI have NEVER had such a terrible service experience.
4 ||| Oh man.. I've been coming to Lupie's since I was in elementary school. It's always crowded, but that gives it this awesome homey feel. It's got perfect tea served in mason jars, delicious chili, good sandwiches, fast service and the best mac&cheese money can buy. What more could you want?
4 ||| This place has figured it out.  Great food at a reasonable price.   and special request are their specialty. They love to please their customer.   And all their food is cook to order and fresh. \n\nWe live in west phoenix and found this place several years ago from a referral from our doctors office in Scottsdale and have been coming hear every time we come to Scottsdale.\n\nThis place is worth a try.  I would have a hard time believing you would not like them, unless of course you think panda express is really Chinese food.
4 ||| Still the best and will always recommend to everyone!  Twice cook chicken and moo shu pork are the two best dishes.
0 ||| Very disappointing meal there last weekend. Had a group of six and service was painfully slow...over 3 hours for 4 courses.  Service very poor for a James Beard winner...in fact, of the 30+ Beard restaurants I've been to, this was the worst.\n\nExamples including pouring our red before our white without asking.  Not mentioning the two bottle max on two occasions...both with initial reservation and a later confirmation.  What floored me is that I confirmed a change in our party and confirmed the corkage policy and the hostess never mentioned the max...I guess it the customer's responsibility to ask such things in their mind.  In addition, we had printed out the wine list and never saw a corkage policy online...if it is there, we couldn't find it.\n\nSturgeon was overcooked shoe leather.  Balance of meal was probably a 3 on a scale of 5.\n\nMy entire party agreed that they wouldn't return as we had much better service at other Madison restaurants.  Sister restaurant Graze...completely different experience...great service and great food...much quicker and for less money.
3 ||| Okay.. the good first: my partner really, really likes this place. It's the only pizza he eats, and pizza is pretty much his favorite food. He usually gets the thin crust/well baked sausage pizza, sometimes the deep dish, but for him, no complaints. So that's nice! \n\nThe bad: God, I fucking hate this joint. I don't like pizza, but their menu is big enough that when we do order in, I can try and get something new. Half of the time, they'll screw the order up. (Did I want a chicken parm with pasta? They send the sandwich. Did I want the chicken parm sandwich? They send the pasta.) Usually when this happens they'll send someone to fix their mistake - we've had quite a few times where they completely forgot half of our order - and that's pretty good of them. They always seem polite about it and service is fairly prompt.\n\nBut honestly the food isn't that good. It's greasy and bland and if I wanted mediocre Italian food, I'd make it myself. I'd say we go here once or twice a month, so this isn't a one-off thing - if  you like stuff that's bogged down with oil and cheese, great. If you want to taste what you're eating, well. Go somewhere else.
4 ||| Best pizza in phoenix hands down. Their portions are huge and the price is extremely reasonable. A must every single time I'm in town!
0 ||| I used to like this place... \nWent in for a quick lunch around 1:00pm. We sat in the bar (I like to avoid screaming children). \nOur server was friendly and he is the only reason this place is getting two stars. \nThe bread arrived screaming hot and lovely. \nI ordered the warm spinach salad which was supposed to be spinach, roasted garlic, prosciutto, lemon, olive oil and topped with toasted goat cheese. (sounds good right?) \nMy friend ordered the half sandwich and salad combo. \nIt took OVER 35 minutes for our salads to arrive! Really?? \nWhen I saw mine I actually laughed. It was a pile of spinach with a cold, greasy half breaded medallion of goat cheese with one clove of garlic and a small mushy ball of prosciutto. It tasted like dishwater. \nThe server never checked on us and I had to go find him. He took the salad and offered me something else. \nI got the Mozzarella Alla Caprese. Cant screw that up right... \nThe tomatoes were so hard and pink they were borderline inedible. They were topped with one basil leaf and half of a mini mozzarella ball. It sucked. \nI'm done with this place. If you go, have the bread and leave!
0 ||| We usually go there as an office for lunch  a few time a month but today we had an in-house meeting so we ordered.  Got there and the order was ready but the number of cups they would only give  for as much as we ordered was a far cry from past exp.   Ask for chips and threw in one bag, then upon returning to the office we where short on food.  Called back and got their \"FULL\" voice mail finally got through and when I said the order  was not complete the call dropped twice.  Very disappointing
0 ||| I lived in an apartment at Legacy Bungalows for an 8 month period in 2010/2011.  The apartments themselves are nice.  Our apartment was very large for a one bedroom and it had a nice open floor plan and high ceilings.  The grounds and pool area was always well maintained.  The location is convenient to downtown, once you walk past a few blocks of sketchiness.  The management was always very friendly and was quick to repair maintenance issues.  And to top it all off the rent was dirt cheap!\n\nSo why would I not recommend the Legacy Bungalows?  Well that would be because of our fellow neighbors.  Many of the apartments are rented out as section 8/low income apartments, and it shows.  I should have been tipped off when I was signing my lease and I had to sign several documents saying I would not commit a crime or sell drugs in the apartment complex.  Some of the things I experienced while living there include being awoken at 6 am on a Sunday by someone trying to beat in my neighbors door with a baseball bat screaming, \"I'm going to f-ing kill you b*tch!\", people inside the dumpster rummaging through our trash several times a week, parking my car next to the most dumpy cars I've ever seen in my life, being asked several times if I \"smoked\" and if I wanted to buy some \"weed\", and having my door checked if it was unlocked by people who seem to be checking every door in the complex presumably to break in and steal things.  The door checking thing happens several times a week, making me paranoid that my door be locked at all times.  \n\nUntil they stop renting to low income families and the surrounding area cleans up a little, I would avoid living here.
4 ||| Our go-to place for good, non-overpriced vietnamese food in vegas! I don't know why people go to pho saigon, because there's no line here and I think the food is better! It's just a little farther drive down spring mountain rd. \n\nI've had the pho, vermicelli, and the rice dishes here and everything is good! You can't fail with whatever you order, so don't worry! I always end up caving into ordering the fillet mignon (bo luc lac) with french rice because I just can't say no to garlic! They make it better than the restaurants in little saigon in california! If you're a garlic lover like myself, you'll love this dish because the beef is drenched in so much garlic, you'll have enough to eat it with the rice too!
4 ||| First time here. 11:30 on a Tuesday morning and it's only 1/4 full. Where is everyone? Sat by the drive thru window and that line was busy and crawling. Too bad. Maybe that's where everyone is?\nOrdered the Angus beef and cheese on jalape\u00f1o cheddar bread. It arrived in 7 mins. Bread was fresh (toasted), produce crisp and the meat was heated-all good. Not as much meat as, say, Port of Subs. Tasted good tho. Good table side hot sauce. Gave it a nice kick. Good touch guys. \nI recommend the beef and cheese sandwich. It was tasty and filling.
0 ||| Alright.. A-hem... er, F*** I hate giving poor reviews! This place isn't HORRIBLE, but it most CERTAINLY isn't as good as what they charge for it.\n\nI went here for lunch today because I was feeling adventurous. I felt the need for something new, and it was a toss up between Cypress Grill and this place. Unfortunately, I picked THIS place... We sat down and ordered my 4 year old the corn dog on the kids menu for $3.50. I ordered the 1/2 shrimp po'boy and chicken/sausage gumbo $10.50, and my wife ordered a chicken po'boy and gumbo of the same $9.50.\n\nOut comes my son's corn dog.  It was nice that they brought that out quick, because kids get anxious when waiting for their food. As do some adults, I suppose... nonetheless, it was one of those frozen-type corn dogs that you can buy by the box... As soon as I saw this, my feeling for adventure was snuffed.  The food DID come out fast. I'll give them that, but it was a bit shy of good.\n\n1/2 Shrimp Po'boy: Keep in mind, they charge $10.50 for a full sized sandwich.  My sandwich had maybe 5 shrimp on it, some lettuce and two small pieces of tomato on the side.  The horseradish sauce was, indeed, good but there lacked anything GOOD to put it on. So I just dunked my two dry pieces of bread and 5 shrimp in the sauce. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the taste.  The taste was good. but the price I paid doesn't constitute what I received.\n\nChicken and Sausage Gumbo: I must admit, my wife ruined this one for me.  She mentioned how it reminded her of the canned soup of the same, and, I sh*t you not, it DID taste like canned soup! the chicken was SUPER mushy, and the sausage tasted like they bought a kelbasa, sliced it up, and added it to the soup just before serving. It was not good at all.\n\nI can't comment on my wife's po'boy, but it didn't look much better than mine. Two pieces of bread with some chicken. Meh...\n\nThat's right, I said it! Meh, Meh, Meh!!! And with that, I will be making a Meh list to put this in... Actually, I think I already have one.
3 ||| I went here for linner today as I had a groupon (yay for using up my groupons!). The BF and I got there around 3 oclock so the place wasn't so busy, there were still a few tables in there, though. They have some interesting things on their menu, but I decided to be kind of safe and got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad combo with the thyme chicken and goat cheese salad. They were both good, but the sandwich was better than the salad. The salad looks like they always use the same base salad and then just throw the extras that make it a 'specialty' salad on top. That was alright though. I thought the fried goat cheese was good, the balsamic that I got with it was weirdly thick, but tasted good. The chicken on the sandwich was tasty. The thing that got me was they make this huge deal out of their making their own bread, but it's not anything special. It kind of tastes like nothing.... weird. The BF got the still crazy after all these years sandwich, which is fried mozzarella and veggie (which was what I wanted! but the BF is pickier than me so I let him have it). This was pretty good too.... I mean, what isn't when it's fried? He said the sandwich would have been better had it had fried tomatoes and melted cheese instead of fried cheese.... I thought it tasted good. He got fries as his side (even though I urged him to get the mashed potato pie thing.... *sigh) and they were good, they tasted kind of beer battered. Although this place was good, I wouldn't wait in line to eat here.
4 ||| Following the advise of the first Yelper; I asked for Tiffany.\n\nShe squeezed me right after I called.  Walk-ins are welcome, but give a call before heading over.  There is convenient parking (like the rest of Henderson) and quick access with the main cross roads.\n\nThe decor of the place is pretty rockin.  It is a oldschool golf and sea captain feel with a parrot in back for added ambiance.  There is a flatscreen on the wall with travel channel or some other watchable entertainment while you get your cut.\n\nTiffany is a gem with a beautiful smile and outgoing personality.  She is great at her job and seems to truly like it.  She is friendly and talkative, but not overly conversational.\n\nI was able to get a great scissor cut and a beard trim in about 20 minutes for $20.  I walked out the door feeling and looking great.  \n\nThere are other stalls and barbers at Mr. D's, but I am confident that Tiffany will hook you up.
3 ||| They are called Island Style but once you see their menu, you will discover that they serve Hawaiin, Korean, and American dishes.\n\nFirst off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it. \n\nSo I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.\n\nI ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). \n\nI probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat. \n\nSo overall, I wasnt really blown away. My bill was about 10 dollars. I tipped 2 bucks which was what I thought was more than generous considering my mediocre experience. I dont think I will be going out of my way just to eat here.
1 ||| This sports bar offers food and drinks at a reasonable price. They also offer pool, darts, a reasonable smoking patio, a TV section for watching events, off track dog race betting, and poker nights i believe.\n\nI frequented this establishment from 2003 to 2006 when the atmosphere was fun, the staff would remember you by name and there was usually a pool table or dart board available.\n\nI stopped going here because nearly the entire staff was turned over, whomever is managing the bar has surrendered the entire pool table section to a league which seems to play every night and the fun atmosphere has turned into a tense one with the lower class crowed that has moved in.\n\nI am sad to say this once fun bar is now only good for... well not much.
0 ||| It's your sub-standard breakfast joint. Moderately busy on any given weekday, ungodly busy on Saturdays. It seems like everyone wakes up at the exact same moment and realizes they don't want know how to make pancakes in their own kitchen. \n\nThe menu is what you've had in every other joint -- pancakes, sausage, bacon, toast, fruit, etc. One thing I do end up enjoying more than any other carb-laden item is the oatmeal. It's actually pretty good and rather hearty. \n\nIf you're headed in for a quick breakfast/readthrough of the paper on a weekday, you're safe. If you're coming in for a Saturday breakfast at 10am, good luck.
0 ||| Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side.
4 ||| We had intended to go to Micro Diner (closed until further notice) and a couple on the street recommended J&Js. We were glad they did! Yes, it's a diner. If you are expecting a high brow affair, go somewhere else. But the breakfast was great. I had the 'loaded pancakes', pancakes mixed with chunks of bacon and sausage with two fried eggs in the middle. How can you go wrong with that! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and, while I didn't get one, they have bacon milkshakes! Mmm...next time....\n\nOh yeah! CASH ONLY!!!
4 ||| I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down.
0 ||| Came here because I wanted boba. I wanted a decaf tea drink but they didn't have any. I got the mango slush and my bf got the jasmine green tea. His was very fragrant. \n\nTried their $5 spicy (popcorn) chicken. It was gross. Dry, flavorless, and was probably fried twice. It was dark and just gross. \n\nI should've saved that $5 and went next door for their fresh spring rolls!
4 ||| Excellent customer service, delicious food. I've been here more than any other restaurant in Phoenix since moving here a year and a half ago. They've recently expanded their building... now the interior looks nice, too. Parking used to be an issue, but now they have a lot with plenty of space. \n\nWhen I asked about the new interior my group and I actually received a mini tour of the place. They showed us the kitchen (we didn't go inside, of course) and other areas. That's going way over what's expected, if you ask me. \n\nI see a lot of good reviews on their dessert, however I always leave stuffed with a ton of leftovers on even the smallest meals and haven't had a chance to try any. \n\nPS: Get the \"stupid fries\".
4 ||| Wow!  Best gyros I have ever had, I think.  The fries were also awesome..perfectly crispy, and freshly made.  Employees very friendly.  Prices were decent.  I would definitely go back, and would recommend it.  Everything was perfect about our meal!
0 ||| This place was nice as far as decor and surroundings but it didn't leave me with the impression that its somewhere I'd frequent. I've been to several Greek restaurants and although this one has the biggest menu I wasn't too excited about any one dish.\n\nWhen we were seated our waiter Tyler who was a great sport during our request for extra items. He was patient and played along with us as we joked. We ordered a lot of food just to see what different flavor they had to offer.\n\nWe order grape leaves, baba ganoush, two salads one with falafel and one aladdin salad and some kind of heart shaped pastry dish. I forget the name of it though. So my sister order the heart shaped dish and then decided she didn't want to eat it in order to save room for her salad. The eggplant dip aka baba was not as creamy as hummus  but was more like cottage cheese with a little crunch to it. It was just ok. The pita bread was served cool not warm or hot but cool. It lacked flavor and honestly tasted like bathroom paper towels. \n\nWhen our salads came I had a dressing that was their tahini yogurt. It had the consistency of sour cream and tasted very much like it. I couldn't use it on my salad though because it had absolutely no flavor. It went great with the falafel but just was not a good dressing for an already bland salad. Both salad only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. I asked for kalamata olives on my salad to add some flavor but my sisters was supposed to already have some. When our food came out. Her's was missing olives and i had a full container of them. She tried to take mine because hers didn't have them so we called the waiter over. Tyler told us that her salad was supposed to have olives but that the extra cup did belong with my plate. I paid $1 for those olives!! So he brings her back some olives but only put three on the salad. I was laughing so hard. You give her this huge salad but only 3 olives?? that's an insult to the salad.\n\nSo back to my food. I switched out the yogurt for their balsamic vinaigrette which i told i wouldn't be charged for but when the bill came I seen it on there. I didn't make a complaint about $.65 cents but its the principle. After a $38 bill and a meal leaving you wondering if you ate enough. It's unlikely i'll come back anytime soon.
0 ||| I was there with the same group as Chrystalle B (below).  The food was great, but that was it.  Service was slow and the bill was a complete joke.  There weren't prices on all the items on the menu, so 12 people trying to look at a calculator tape and try to figure out what roll was what price? Not a good time.  We won't be back!
0 ||| I dropped in here a few times for late night after work dinner. Great that it's open til 2amish for late night workers like us. \n\nI walk in and hear loud Thai music and I'm not quite sure how to take it....looks like they have a Karaoke set up. Someone started to sing while we order...it's kinda distracting as he was the only one singing and everyone else seemed like they were there to eat- maybe too he could have just been a mic hog and people were waiting for him to step off. \n\nThe food is alright here specially for late night but the service was a bit spotty with no one checking on us after we got our food. Been here 2-3 more times and kinda similar service. I think for late night I rather go to Krung down the ways so I don't have to be hearing them blasting Thai songs.
4 ||| Close to work, I prefer their coffee over bucks.  Nice selection of soups, salads, and sandwiches for lunch.  The service is usually pretty quick but, can be backed up if you go right at noon...best to arrive 15 minutes early for lunch.
3 ||| This review is bittersweet because I am a former employee (until 1997), but the truth must be told.\n\nWe arrive very excited at our table, only to sit there 5-6 minutes before a server comes to greet us. I would have been more tolerant had the place been packed to the gills, but surprisingly this Saturday afternoon at 1pm was relatively slow.\n\nFound out they no longer carry Sicilian Splash, that was a real downer (gone for 8 months apprently)\n\nOur server was great, once she actually arrived on the scene, and was attentive to our needs. Above average.\n\nNow the bottom line: pricing. This location is gorgeous, ,totally decked out and beautiful. It has to be build into the prices because they ARE too expensive for what they offer.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food itself is above average, but the prices are above above above average. Get it? :)\n\nI think with Oregano's opening in Chandler (Feb '11) is going to take away from Olive Garden's share, ALOT, as they are now running 1 1/2-2 hours waits in the evening.\n\nI used to have an intimate love affair with you OG, but alas I have a new mistress
2 ||| Great for odd juices and European treats. Their salads are top notch and the baked goods are delish. It's just always so darn crowded in there and it's hard to get the attention of the sometimes flippant counter staff. Great people watching. I don't see how this place has been voted good for groups, unless they're ordering out?
0 ||| We were excited to have our wedding at Sunset Gardens, and part of the appeal was its all inclusive package. Everything looked nice and thankfully we had a great time with our family and friends, but some of the services were just horrible. \n\nFirst, the DJ waited until 3 days before the wedding to contact us and boast about his 30 years experience, but then he played barely anything from a list we put together for him. He is old school and only has music on CD or Vinyl. Then he would play the full length of every song, which to me seemed lazy. When people are dancing we would like to mix it up and keep the tracks changing, not just play long drawn out songs the whole time. I even made it a point to explain before hand that I did not want him to play the songs all the way through. And beside the fact he barely played anything we asked for, he played the one artist I specifically told him not to play. The DJ seemed like his 30 years experience and his guarenteed job at Sunset Gardens, makes him take it all for granted.\n\nAnd then there was the photograaphy service: let me just say, the pictures our guests took with their cell phones came out better than this, and then there are additional fees for the touch ups. The exposure on all the pictures is too bright, the bridesmaids SILVER DRESSES are white, when they should be SILVER and people know that a BRIDE picks the colors for a certain reason. And then me, the groom, I was only asked to take two pictures with my groomsmen. For the first picture, I was pulled outside and it was taken on the side of the building, with the yellow curb and graffiti cover up on the wall. Then the photographer took pictures after the ceremony and we had to ask if we could get maby more than one background for our shots. He also rushed every shot and noone was ready so we have some people smiling and others adjusting themselves. Afterwards, we recieve the disc, there are barely any of our guests in the pictures, and only one shot of me with one of my guests. Again, we got the boast, we have been doing this for 30 years. We were even given that same boast by Tony.\n\nWhat it seems to me is that these 30 year veterans need a fresh approach to their game. They are lazy and untalented. We will not be able to get this day back and thank God we have our memories, because these pictures are crap. \n\nI would highly suggest not doing an all inclusive package and make sure you can review everyone of your services prior to booking a wedding. OH and the airplanes were annoying and interupting our ceremony.
0 ||| This store is shameful to the Shadyside family. Upon entering the shop, the blond sales associate judged my friend and I by staring at us and abruptly walking away without a greeting. My friend was given dirty looks form the elderly sales associate while I tried to ignore the rudeness and enjoy the clothing. I am not complaining about the prices, I have bought many items from the same designers and enjoy the designers quality, I was not sticker shocked. What I am upset about is the customer service by these women who think it is okay to treat potential customers with such disrespect. Neither me friend nor I were dressed poorly, we are both fashion stylist in the Pittsburgh area. I have never been so disrespected in my life and after writing this review I will be contacting the owner.
0 ||| I went to this venue for the Lady Gaga concert.  Lady Gaga gets FIVE STARS!   The concert was amazing, the best performance I have EVER seen!  US Airways Center gets THREE STARS. The venue though was a little disappointing.  I was expecting to be over charged but, $10 for a beer?!?  And $6 for a WATER?!?  That was just too much.  I recommend being full hydrated and fed before you enter.
3 ||| Cute place for a short visit of about an hour  or two.  The train driver was highly entertaining.  The guide for the mine and the mystery house looked like he was anxious to get it all over with.  The lady from the bordello didn't even pretend to be interested...  We did enjoy seeing the reptiles although we felt sorry to seethem confined to such small spaces.  The best part of our visit were the views of Superstition mountain.  Next time we'll go hiking instead.  Note to the owners:  It gets annoying to constantly be forking out money for every visit.  Why not just charge a higher fee that covers everything?  Many people ( especially with large families) turned away from some activities because it was getting too expensive.
4 ||| Came here just looking for something to do on a busted clubbing night in Vegas, and this place made my weekend!  Set humbly and inconspicuosly on the 2nd floor of a small plaza off of Spring Mtn Rd, this Japanese styled beer house has the rustic wooden furnishings & even a large table with cushions and the signature no-shoes policy for the larger groups in the back.\n\nThis izakaya is serving up an endless (no seriously, 100+ items not on the menu line the walls here) combination of grilled and fried delicacies.  My group seemingly tried everything from traditional items like the yakitori & beef tongue skewers, pot stickers, cold ramen, beef bowl, to the more modern fare like the seafood quesadilla, and the deep fried zucchini w/ bacon and mozzerella cheese.  The more friends and fam you have to eat and drink with, the merrier, as my 4 cousins and I were able to shamelessly order dish after dish of great drunk munchies. And washing it all down with ice cold Kirin served on tap made this yelper one satisfied customer.  I'm a fan. You should be too.
2 ||| While the quality of the pizza depends on the time of day you order and the decor leaves a lot to be desired, for a transplanted resident who HATES PA liquor laws, they have a great variety of beer available for what is basically a hole-in-the-wall pizza place. Also, delicious provolone sticks, but why doesn't anyone in this city sell mozzarella sticks.
1 ||| Do not order delivery from this place. They took down the wrong address and came VERY late. The food was ok.
4 ||| Excellent Food, Best in Scottsdale.. The owners Orlando and Jackie are wonderful people and run a great restaurant. You have to try this place.
4 ||| We enjoyed a phenomenal Christmas Eve dinner this year at Rokerij. We had a larger party (16) so we used the private room they have behind the bar. It was fantastic. Shannon and Paul were fantastic while we set this up and the night couldn't have been better. Tony did a great job with such a large group. Of course, the food is just crazy good.... The \"Rokerij\" side of the menu is traditional American fare while the \"Richardson's\" side of the menu is New Mexico-style Mexican food (WONDERFUL if you like spicy). Typical Rokerij, they also had about 10 specials (veal chops were great, salmon and grouper were perfect), plus everything ordered from the menu was wonderful (except the prime rib sliders were way over-cooked and bland). We highly recommend... Thanks Rokerij for a great night.
4 ||| Hubby and I like to hang out in Charlotte on the weekends, and this is definately a great hotel. If you want to relax - it is suitable, but if you want to people watch and have a great drink - the lounge works too! \n\nThe rooms are always the same -  clean, cool and with a descent view of the Queen City! I have called ahead, and booked through the reservations line - and this is the only complaint I have. \n\nOne time I visited, they did not have my reservation on file. The front desk obviously does not share the information that the main booking line has. They had actually reserved a room in Columbia, SC in error - then charged us for not showing up !? \n\nEverything was resolved a week later so we got over it! \n\nAlso, if you stop in the bar on the way out, or just chill down there to enjoy the view -- you just might run into a celebrity. I refuse to name drop, but we have spotted a couple of celebrities there, and they are usually pretty friendly !
0 ||| I had to downgrade my rating after last night's delivery. I received a free delivery coupon from Delicious Deliveries so we used it for dinner. There weren't a lot of options in my zip code so we settled on Macayo's. \n\nWe started out with the green corn tamale bites. I didn't care for them but my hubby seemed to enjoy them. They also gave us a big bag of chips with sides of salsa, pretty good as I stated in my previous review. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the steak fajitas & I ordered the carne asada burrito (with rice & beans added). Hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross. The bottom was so soggy I couldn't eat it as a whole, just picked at it & threw a lot away. For dessert I ordered the flan & since our order was over $30 we got a free dessert as well so I chose the mini chocolate chimis. The flan was ok & the chocolate chimis with ice cream were pretty good. \n\nTotal with tip & free delivery was about $50. We won't be ordering here again...I'm pretty much just done with the whole food delivery service thing after 2 expensive, not so great meals.
4 ||| After reading the notions, ins and outs of a co-op grocery store, I'm sold. My husband and I agreed that we'd be members of this amazing grocery store if we lived in Madison. Yes, it's a bit more expensive than Trader Joe's, but it also offers an outstanding variety of local produce, baked goods, meats, sauces, drinks, sweets and other food items. I had a vegan chocolate cupcake with a gooey chocolate ganache that made me radiate stars, hearts and little birds of happiness. It was that good. We bought a fair amount of food that will last us throughout the week. Worth checking out if you're a foodie.
3 ||| I know I am from out of town, but there is no greeting at the door or system for new customers. It looks like a good place to eat and hang out, after you establish yourself.
4 ||| Stopped in here for lunch on this Wednesday & the place was already really jumping at 11:30.  It has an odd shape to it, & no booths, but I did land a comfortable spot at a table, & the cool, \"shady\" atmosphere of the place is a nice treat when you come in from the roasting heat outside.\n\nGenerous servings of (great!) chips & salsa arrived right away, & I ordered a \"#97 Combo\", which comes with a Chile Relleno, a Cheese Enchilada, & a shredded beef taco, plus refried beans & Spanish Rice.  Pretty soon my order arrived, piping hot & every bite of it was absolutely delicious!  (Top service, too.)\n\nThis is the same meal I had at Pitic 3 days ago, & the food is excellent there too, so here's why Mi Patio gets an extra star from me:\n\n*  The chips & salsa are both better here, I think.\n\n*  This meal here had the same items, but there was more of everything.\n\n*  This restaurant is nicer, & in a much better area.\n\nThe price here was about $2 more at $10.65, but would you pay that for one of the best Mexican meals you've ever had in Arizona?  I thought so!  Get over here, because Mi Patio is AWESOME!!    :-))
4 ||| They now have smaller lunch-sized portions (which are still enough for two and average 1300 calories). But it's still a smaller portion and a smaller price on top of that. \nService is always excellent - staff bends over backward for you. How nice is that at a chain shop??
3 ||| Not worth $220 but the course is in wonderful shape.  The greens are amazing here.  The ball actually rolls where it should go.  +1 star!
0 ||| It had been awhile since I'd been to a Lone Star and I really had no memories of the experience, so a few friends and I decided to try it out as it was the nearest steakhouse to our location.\n\nWe were extremely disappointed. Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.\n\nI ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.\n\nThe salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.\n\nWhen my entr\u00e9e showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been saut\u00e9ed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).\n\nAlthough the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location. Sorry, Lone Star.
4 ||| I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be! \n\nClean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library.
1 ||| Great selection of fresh seafood and seafood dishes. Everything is marked clearly, so you can tell what was frozen, farm-raised, etc. Stop in for the fried Daily Catch, Cod or Salmon for the tastiest fish you'll eat in town. The counter staff is friendly and helpful. There is a stand up/bar stool area for eating there, but no comfortable sit down tables.
0 ||| Chimi had ground beef instead of shredded beef, crab quesadilla had no flavor, corn and Mac and cheese floating at the bottom of my water glass.  Told manager and he wanted to argue about how the beef was high quality and tastes good.  no apology, no offer to compensate, nothing.  Came here for my birthday dinner, crappy way to end my day.
4 ||| Love this place! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Mmm table bread, Mountain Dew, & Caesar Salads!!
4 ||| Can be a really fun cool place with the exception of one bartender. I wish I knew her name because she is horrible.  Actually, it was home bar for about 8 of of us  but none want risk her being there so we will wait until she is gone before going back.
0 ||| Bummed, the only thing that was truly amazing was the foi
0 ||| We have been using Blue Cross since we moved to the Valley nearly 15 years ago.  We had always thought they were great.... until recently.  We had a cat who had been their patient since we moved here.  We had been in several times with him over the preceding month or so because he was old and showing his age.  The day I called them and really needed them, though, I asked if they could see him that day because our guy had stopped moving around very much, and stopped eating and drinking.  I told them this over the phone, only to be told they could 'fit me in' next Thursday (more than a week after I was calling).  I'd been bumped and forced to wait for myriad emergencies of others; I figured this was the time we would be the emergency.\n\nI understand that the vets have lives.  But I seriously expected someplace I'd been going to (and spent lots of money with over the years) to be a LOT more accommodating when a pet is in need of end of life services, especially one who has been a patient for so long.  \n\nThe doctors have always been great.  Unfortunately, the quality of the staff has been going downhill in recent years.  This latest experience has caused us to finally decide to find another vet.
0 ||| Stopped by to return a trailer that we hauled from Seattle, WA - there was about a 15 min wait while other customers are serviced by the 2 available employees.  We had misplaced our paperwork in the hectic hustle of moving , but the employee was gracious enough to look up our information on the computer. \n\nThe only thing I would ding on is the professionalism of the employees - it was wretched hot, & one of the employees questioned if the co-worker was wearing deodorant; this was in front of a handful of customers.  But then again, I come here for the equipment, not for the mind-blowing service. \n\nAll in all, I have no qualms about returning for equipment rentals.  Easily accessible location, spacious lot, & honestly, there's no other competition in town.  Also, they tend to be slammed Fri-Sun, so be prepared to wait.
4 ||| My last visit to Red Robin was a perfect example of bare minimum service. What I mean by that is the lowest amount for the standard tip.\n1. The 12 min. wait for a seat even though there was 9 free tables, 6 of which were in between stationed areas- the remaining 3 was probably closed off.\n2. The server provided one refill for drinks.\n3. Service was relatively quick, but server was not aware of terminology on their own menu. (I ordered \"bunless\" and printed on the menu, a note says, \"Order it BUNLESS, get your burger wrapped in lettuce.\" Yet she still asked me if I wanted my burger to be wrapped in lettuce.)\nThis would normally warrant a 2 star rating but oddly enough this sub par service was not as bad as most of the places I've been to as of lately.\nI wanna say keep it up, but you can do better. Just think about food service in the 80's and 90's. They only looked for 10% gratuity but their excellence far exceeds today's standards.
4 ||| Very, very good barbecue. I had the rib tips with cole slaw and mac n cheese. Outstanding! Saw this place on DDD and Guy Fieri raved about their food and the freshness of their meat... I couldn't agree more. Perfect smoke flavor, the sauce had the right spice, and the mac was a perfect Southern side dish. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice, low cost bbq dinner
0 ||| so we bought a new 24 in LED display online and it arrived. everything great, waited a week or two for the new MacBookPro to arrive before we could fire it up. (mini DVI, duh whats that right? lol)\n\nso boom it fires up for the first time and i see it. a black triangle of burned out LEDs WHOA!!! no fun. panic was released and calm restored. it's 2 weeks old, i'll take it to an Apple store for a replacement.\n\nso Saturday morning i made an appointment at the Genius bar to have them look at it, and hopefully say, \"We'll just replace it for you\"....\n\nwell after an interesting turn of events on the light rail, i showed up late, only 15 minutes. but my reservation was already voided..my fault. no biggie.\n\ni tell the guy at the genius bar check in what the deal is and he says, we can put you back in the queue and one of the genius can look at it.\n\ni said \"is there a way we can just get an exchange, i don't really want to hear that it would need to be shipped off to wherever to be fixed\" he said sure, but they might have the parts there to fix it, and that the online stock and the in-store stock are different, so he might not be able to exchange but would go check into it....15 minutes later he walked out of the room behind the genius bar with another monitor. i walked over to the exclusive register since they switched over to the mobile point of sales set up. after a couple bar code scans i was walking out the store with a new monitor. a new monitor without burned out LEDs that is. \n\ni was happy.\n\nas far as the maddening POS system they have, i give it 3.5 stars\n\ni get the concept and that it should speed up sales, but when your ignorant to who has one of the hand held devices or don't even know thats how you check out. you can be seriously put off by the whole process. but now that i know. i have no issues with it. who really needs a bag anyways.
2 ||| Generic, but what else do you expect from most downtown businesses. It's a sports bar for sure. Every meal comes with it's own built in wide-screen television tuned in to some sport where a a bunch of troglodytes go up against another bunch of neanderthals. Service was nice, the place was fairly empty. The d\u00e9cor was interesting. I liked the low lighting and the fans over the bar.\n\nPet Peeve... our waitress didn't know shit about the craft beer she was serving us. This is what knocked the 3rd star off.\n\nThey have a decent beer selection but you better know your stuff cause asking the waitstaff about their beer selectionwill just get you an, \"umm... err... we have bud, bud light, coors light and miller light on special.\"\n\nWent with a couple of friends. I saw something called Tatchos in their appetizer section. I ordered it as it sounded like the most insanely unhealthy thing I could eat. It certainly was. The appetizer portion could definitely feed half the population of Peru. I can't even imagine what the full entr\u00e9e size must be! They were ok. Nachos with Tator Tots is what I got.\n\nOverall not a bad experience. Not the type of place I'd plan to go but if my friends, who live right around the corner, drag me there again, it'd be fine.
4 ||| Finally visited Coreana last Friday with the GF after having passed by the restaurant many times.  The restaurant is located in a unique downstairs space in the little concrete island of restaurants and businesses near the intersection of University and Randall Aves. It's easy to miss driving by if you aren't paying attention, so park around Union South and walk up.\n\nA sign at the entrance promises Korean and Japanese food, but the menu is almost entirely Korean (a Japanese American friend of mine laments at the fact that many \"Japanese\" restaurants are in fact owned  by Koreans--not over the ownership, mind you, but at the quality of the food.  We joke that it's payback over the whole history of colonialism in Korea--i.e., we'll take their food and cook it bad : )\n\nAsian American Studies aside, I ordered the Rock Bowl Bim Bim Bap and the GF got the Kim Chi Ji-Gae.  The Bim Bim Bap came out sizzling, the food and service was quick, ingredients fresh, and the meal overall was satisfying.  The GF's kim-chi had its usual kick, but my Bim Bim Bap took a lot of chili sauce to bring it up to the requisite level of Korean spiciness.\n\nI have to admit that having lived in Los Angeles and haunting the restaurants in Koreatown, we were a bit disappointed with the overall quality compared to LA and the west coast.  With only a couple Korean restaurants in Madison, it's kind of hard to complain though. \n\nWe did notice a lot of Korean diners in the restaurant, many of whom had ordered the bulgogi and other meat dishes which looked quite appetizing, so I would recommend anyone planning to visit Coreana to check these dishes out first, or perhaps some of the soups.  If we end up at Coreana again, we'll definitely choose one of these above...
4 ||| this is what i would call a sweet book shop.  i have been shopping here since i was a freshman in college...17 years later i still find myself wandering in here when i'm in need of a distraction.  the staff are very helpful and always amaze me when they are able to locate something.  imagine an old building with a zillion floors, nooks, and crannies and then piles upon piles of old books everywhere...i know it sounds like heaven doesn't it?  well it is.  you will walk in searching for something and walk out found.
4 ||| This is a store that you really can't beat. it reminds me of the variety stores that I used to go to when I was a kid that had a little bit of everything.  The location isn't fancy-an old strip center-but I am not going in there for fancy.  You see the same staff, young and older, when you go in and they get to know you.  This is one of those stores you can walk in not knowing quite what you need (speaking from personal experience) and they will make real effort to find it for you. They are always up to date on what they have in stock and have some pretty good \"true value discounts.\"  They also carry some of those things you don't think are made any more or what you'd expect to have to find in a specialty store. I didn't even know that they make plastic screws, did you ?  I know if I can't find it at Koller's, I might as well just go to Home Depot because only a really big store is going to have what I want.\n\nI personally prefer to support smaller stores. I like the convenience of getting what I want and getting out easily.  I also appreciate the fact that the people at Koller's do appreciate my business and remember who I am.  This is a nice place, for a hardware store, to write a review about.\n\nOne tip.  There is parking in the back which saves you from having to hope there is a space open in the front-saves time!.
4 ||| My technician was both professional and personable.  Very easy and satisfying experience with Safelite.
2 ||| Oh, this place. It was this place that made me realize that sometimes the worst review has the most truth in it.\n\nI've never had such bland Indian food, ever. As another reviewer said, I should have known from the type of customers in there: no Indians. We ordered their masala fries, tikka masala, and a coconut shrimp dish. The fries were fine. Tough to mess up fries, although they didn't have the distinct flavor they sounded like they would have. The other two dishes? I didn't know you could call the same dish under two different names. Both looked the same, tasted the same, and were regretful the same. And it was just as expensive as a good Indian restaurant.\n\nOn the upside, the naan was good and the service was pleasant.
4 ||| I go to school nearby and someone had told me about this place.  I went in and the gentlemen at the front was so nice.  He explained the menu without me having to ask.  I ordered the grilled chicken and the hummus(of course) to go.  I was surprised when I got home how much food I got and how good it was.  The chicken was cooked just perfect.  The hummus tasted really fresh and I got plenty of peta bread.  Other places never give me enough with the hummus.  I will be a regular here.
0 ||| A group of us went there for the cafe and let the kids looks at the books.  I am just going to review the cafe.  We were all reviewing the menu, I have not been there in a LONG time.  She was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted.  CHILL!  I ordered a medium green tea latte.  She was very rude and loud, DO YOU HAVE A BORDER'S CARD?  She prepared my drink.  It was so hot, I had to wait 5 full mins before drinking it.  When I picked the cup also thought it was very light.  The cup was only 3/4 filled? WTF?  The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment.
4 ||| Been here a few times, but most recently the other day.  Taking Mona's suggestion - I had the andouille sausage linguine and it was decent.  My friend had the flank steak that I wish I had ordered.  It was cooked to perfection and rested in a blackberry mole reduction.  On previous visits, I've had the atlantic salmon and vegetable lasagna - both great choices.  The service is usually good, except this time I felt the server was either overly attentive - borderline rushing us....but it wasn't a big deal.  The environs are terrific - white tablecloths with kitschy cute 1940s classroom chairs.  Weird touch, but retro cool.  A recommended central Phoenix favorite.\n\nUPDATE - 1/25/07\nThe hostess was very gracious and accommodating checking on us every so often as we had drinks and waited for our table.  The owner came out and chatted with us after the meal to make sure everything we great, and even went back to the chef to clarify ingredients for me, plus added a little back story on the halibut sandwich w / german potato salad.  Definitely a friendly, homey atmosphere.  Loved it.
0 ||| 1 star for the horrible to go service.\nI'm writing this review after 5 tries of ordering to go, so I think my rating is fair. \nRestaurants thrive on consistency. \nWell Pita Jungle is consistent--on horrible service.\nThe hostess who took my order on the phone was very rude. She constantly told me to \"speak up, I can't hear you\" in a rude manner. \nA customer friendly approach would be \"I'm sorry, our restaurant is loud, can you please speak up.\"\nAfter placing my order, I asked for the total. She rudely responded \"I don't have it front of me.\" \nAgain, a nicer approach would be \"I will have your total upon your arrival\" or something to that extent. \nPicking up the order was another ordeal of rude service!\nI often order to go from my favorite restaurants. After 5 experiences of horrible phone service and pick up service, Pita Jungle is a \"no go\" for me!
4 ||| Five star all the way! Waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and listended.  Everything about the restaurant was spectacular.  The atmosphere, the elegance, the first class service.  The waiter and staff only called me by my name for introduction purposes.  I did not feel like it was overbearing at all as I read in some negative reviews.\n\nThe food, athough some of the pairings sound odd, went together really well.  I loved the foie gras and the escargot (prepared in a manner never before seen).  \n\nThe buffalo, amazing.  I actually liked it with the red wine reduction from the ribeye with the buffalo.  I asked for pepper to spice it up a bit and was brought three varieties of pepper.  They were amazing!  \n\nCertainly a special occasion location, but so worth it and it deserves all of the positive accolades.
4 ||| Kanopy dance studio is beautiful; spacious, mirrored, well lit, view of state street. I love taking capoeira classes here.\n\nThe capoeira class is excellent and from what I can tell, their other classes, ballroom, ballet, tango, salsa, belly dance, are all high quality.\n\nThey even offer an african drumming class. awesome. come dance.
0 ||| On April 27, 2011,  we bought a 60 Inch television along with accessories ($1799.00 for tv. $3073.59 for the entire purchase) from Frys Electronics.  We also purchased a 3 year in home service contract.  \nOn the evening of April 29, 2014, (just 2 days after the expiration of the service contract) we noticed a thin green line going down the television set.  I called the local number and was told there was nothing they could do, I indicated that having this happen just two days out of warranty and them not honoring it is just wrong.  She transferred me to the service department who also told me there was nothing they could do.\n\nI asked to speak to someone above him and he put me through to the service manager, Steve.  Steve again said there was nothing they could do, I asked who I could speak to above him and he said no one.  So I asked for the phone number for the corporate office.\n\nI called the corporate office and the phone call was weird, it was as if they didn't want to talk to me, she kept talking over me and wasn't really listening.  She indicated she would call the store manager because the corporate office doesn't make decisions (what?, I've never heard of that).  What is the corporate office for?  \n\nI waited one day for the store manager and never heard back.  I then called the store and asked for the manager, they could not find him so transferred me to his voice mail and it went to dead air.  This happened two more times.   The next day I called back two times and the same thing happened.  At least show your customers the respect to answer their questions.  I will never shop here again!!! In addition my father in law was ready to make a major purchase, he also will not be going there.
2 ||| I'm rating this place as a Music Venue and Bar, not as a restaurant. \n\nUB's seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open it's arms and bar to the metal community. \n\nAs far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall. \n\nAs far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the \"dive-ness\" this place exhibits. \nTheir beer menu had 4 or 5 typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, O'Dools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way). \n\nLuckily, beer and metal go together, so people tend to pay. \nThe old man in the Bolo tie checking ID's was definitely a good sport.
4 ||| La Cucina Flegrea is one of the best authentic Italian restaurants you could ask for.  Their menu has a lot of amazing options, but definitely try any of the selections with fish, as it seems to be a specialty.   As it should be, their red sauce has a bit of a spicy kick to it and both meats and fish are cooked to perfection.  We always start the meal with one of the anti pastas and have never been disappointed with the quality or quantity.\n\nThe restaurant is small, very intimate and quite casual. We love the fact that you can get one of the best meals in Pittsburgh at a reasonable price in such a pleasant and casual atmosphere.  The do not take reservations and it is BYOB.
0 ||| Worst Indian in the entire phoenix valley, the lunch buffet had only one chicken dish, one meat, one daal, one vegetable, are you kidding me and nothing was exceptional, it was just average. Not at all good and value for money, Compare the menu with Chutneys on baseline and Ray.\n\nI will never come back again.
4 ||| I ordered delivery from here and we were very happy with the meal!  The sushi was very tasty and my 10-yr-old sister gobbled up her adult-portion of noodles.  We also ordered edamame and seaweed salad, both of which were served just the way we liked it.\n\nA note about the delivery:  First, they were fast!  (I hate waiting for food and appreciate this!)  Second, they separated the hot and the cold food.  How great is that??  One bag for the sushi and seaweed salad and another for the noodles and edamame.  Super helpful since we weren't eating it right away.  We will order from here again!
4 ||| Holy expletive cheap prices.  I dropped off two suits, 16 shirts and two pairs of pants and it was $42.  Yeah that 125 off of my bill back in Cali,  The clothes are clean and ready on time.  What more can I ask for?
3 ||| Some secrets are best kept secret.  However I don't want my new donuts find going out of business anytime soon.  I stumbled across this little gem while trying to find some real donuts for my wife to take to her at work.  I found the People's Bakery.  The donuts selection was wonderful.  The wall mentioned some other baked goods as you walk in like scones, but those are no longer available.  The donuts were fantastic.  So good that I had to go back today and they are still fantastic and the shelves were socked full at 9:30am with plenty of choices and the prices are great.  \nTo be honest i had tunnel vision on the donuts but I believe they have some other things to offer for lunch and dinner.
4 ||| One of our family's favorite choices for pizza...staff has always been very friendly and helpful at this location even when we have to customize their specialty pizzas for the kids. Over the summer we have also tried their s'mores pizza and it was a big hit.  Our favorite right now is the  Herb Chicken Mediterranean....would definitely recommend giving it a try.
4 ||| Rolls where pretty fresh tasting. Not bad for 20$ under new management price. Not sure for how long its up so take advantage!! Sushi maker Bon is on point and attentive Korean BBQ is under the same roof too. All in all good experience. Kanpaii!!
3 ||| Always hot, always tasty, I love my large stuffed crust pepperoni and pineapple with jalape\u00f1os pizza and a side of spicy BBQ wings. Only complaint is they don't put enough pineapple on it. Also, I hate their app
4 ||| This Costco is the location I frequent most since I moved to the neighborhood three years ago. Admittedly, it is not the prettiest-looking store in the best neighborhood, but it is conveniently located, clean, and has a bonus gas station, pharmacy, optical/hearing centers, and tire service center.\n\nSince the parking has been addressed in other reviews, I'll add my $.02:  Most parking lots are positioned perpendicular to their corresponding store. While Costco's lot design is terrible, the standard corner entryway they employ works well here. Wrapping the parking lot around a corner of the building effectively extends the parking to two sides of the building rather than one. This creates more spaces near the entry/exit. In August when I have purchased perishables, I am appreciative of this.\n\nMy various customer service dealings over the past few years have all been positive experiences that left me feeling good about my loyalty to Costco and the Kirkland brand. Associates quickly handle returns without hassle, I am usually able to find an associate on the floor if I have a question, and it appears this particular location employs individuals on the long-term as familiar faces regularly greet me.\n\nWhere quality is concerned, I shop with confidence at Costco. The offerings go way beyond the trusted brands and I value the ability to sample food items before buying. The Kirkland house brand never disappoints and I swear their flowers last longer than any other florists' bouquet!
0 ||| Need more registers open and better customer service this is ridiculous im done shopping here
0 ||| Totally cheap, nasty, gross food! Skip this place.
4 ||| Don't let the location fool you.  The food, service and embience is fabulous. We are definitely going back - best Italian we've had in a long time!
2 ||| Ehh, it was Okay. I didn't purchase anything. Lots to choose from but I am picky on how my fruit and veggies look. These were bottom of the barrel picks. Love how they may be locally grown but ehh, i'll pass on the flies and dirt floor.
4 ||| Bamboo Nails is the best nail salon in Phoenix! They use high quality product. I have tried several nail salons in the area and have been disappointed. Bamboo Nails charges a few dollars more but totally worth it! Your polish wont chip and peel. Ask for Kim to put on a set of nails! She is amazing and listens to how YOU want the nails to look, not her ideas.
4 ||| Quite pricey, but the food is absolutely delicious. You may get a little frustrated with how long it takes to get your food, but once you start eating, you'll realize that the wait was completely worth it. From the outside, this restaurant doesn't look like much more than a simple pizza shop; once you go in, you realize it's a full-scale fancy Italian restaurant!
0 ||| I always enjoy going to Oregano's locations throughout the valley and this location has been great both times I dinned here. \n\nSteak salad is extremely good if you want to stay away from the starch! \n\nLove the service here!\n\nWait time has always been bad but hey, they are busy! I'd rather go to a busy restaurant than a dead one. Last experience at a restaurant that was rather dead resulted in food poisoning. There is a reason that people flock to certain restaurants!
0 ||| Service FU\u20ac%ING SUCKS. To the owner fixer your retarded bar tender. I literally had to set my beer bottle sideways so she could understand that it was empty. Later, I asked for my check and she started counting her penny tips at the register and I swear I did nothing to make her angry. Do not waist your money here unless you want to look at an empty beer bottle more than you want to look at a full beer bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
0 ||| Really disliked my meal.  Considering the bar was set pretty high by an amazing Mexican restaurant I went to in Chicago (who's name escapes me!!), I was really disappointed.  No need to visit again.
3 ||| Thought my carnitas was on the dry side but the chips/salsa were delish and my strawberry marg was freaking strong.  It was really difficult to Christmas shop afterwards.
1 ||| I use to like coming to this place, it was by far my favorite place to eat Pho. But the last time I went, last Sunday, I didn't care for it that much.\nWe were seated in a corner booth next to the door on the other side, servers rushed us to order, after ordering another two severs tried rushing us to order again!?! \n\nFood was brought out pretty quick, a lot of noodles, but where did all my meat go for my combination pho?!! I asked for a little side dish to put my sauce in, never came. My drink was refilled once, it took forever to get my check, and all of a sudden where did my server(s) go? \n\nI just felt super rushed, then when I was ready to go, no one was there...
0 ||| This club is a rip of. First, they swindle you in for drinks, A young vamp comes up and appeases you to pay $ 20.00 to go into a private room then she dry humps you and leaves you. Thugs come in and tell you owe them a few hundred dollars and refuse to relinquish your credit card unless you pay them. The vamp never discusses what the amounts your being charged for beforehand. It's switch and bait in the body rub business. The girls are usually moms of whom are night working girls (with bodyguard boyfriends) some really not that appealing either. My advice: for a lil body pleasure get it in writing beforehand.-It's cheaper to get a regular dance in a stand up nightclub dance floor!
0 ||| Went here for breakfest during the ironman race. Not sure if they regularrly serve breakfest here or not but the breakfest during the ironman was disgusting to say the least. My sister ordered French Toast and it looked like a plate of snot. The batter was runnie and quite obviously under cooked. My dad had the ironman skillet which was so small it wouldn't even make the childrens menu in chicago. The tomato juice wasn't tomato juice but a bar mixer used to make bloody mary's. All and all a big disappointment for breakfest, maybe the dinners are better but the breakfest was just aweful.
4 ||| Here and Panera are my go to places to pick up food on the way home. They've got great asian noodles and awesome salads. The soups are good too, and its easy to wait a couple minutes for food or order online to easily pick up. Big fan of the Penne Rosa, Greek Salad, and Japanese Pan noodles. I'm sure the american style dishes are delicious as well, but they always look overwhelmingly rich to me.
4 ||| Just finished the Sunday brunch with my mother here, first off we were sat on a tiny table with chairs that were not even on the ground. Our waiter was rude and the food was sub par for the price. \n I was very disappointed as I have eaten at this restaurant a couple of times before and had a great experience, not quite sure what has happened here.
0 ||| I used to come here all the time only because they dont have those brushes that beat your car up..so I specifically asked them not to use the hand brush on the front of my car because they go so fast that the handle nicks the corners of my car.. So as I see my car going to the line up what do I see 2 guys using brushes on my car.. So we confronted the lady, and she proceeded to show us how soft the brush bristles are..not my point..but they were nice enough to comp us the wash..then the guy wiping down our car, was worthless.. From now on I'm washing my car at home.. what happened los olivos?
4 ||| If you're drunk get the kitchen sink wings and mac & cheese bites! Their fried zucchini is pretty good too :)
0 ||| Unbelievable,  these people are 30 minutes late and I am their 3rd patient of the day!!  Really?!
1 ||| I always try the current 6 Dollar burger special they have. \nThe food is always just so so. It always seems a little cold like they let things sit around too long before slapped together and tossed in a sack. They are always friendly and the interior is clean, but the food quality is sub-par at best.
4 ||| Dr. Cohen is a fantastic Doctor who I'd highly recommend!! Checked my eyes and my contacts and made slight corrections to my contacts and I was on my way.
0 ||| Congratulations, Perkins! You've won my award for worst food in CU.\n\nThe winner is: a 1/4\" chicken patty that spurts grease when bitten into! And said patty was definitely not a normal breast. More like old school McNuggets.\n\nYUCK.
4 ||| Still waiting for the day that I only give some Ritz-Carlton location a 4 Star review.  After this visit to the Phoenix version, I continue to wait.  Check in was smooth, the room was immaculate, drinks before dinner at the bar were served by a friendly bartender who was clearly proud of the bar menu and quick with recommendations even though I wound up not eating there.  \n\nAbout the room...  I love walking in an R-C room and just soaking up the little things.  The towels hung perfectly even in the bathroom, the water bottles lined up so nicely, no art on the wall with the slightest tilt.  It's moments like these where I admit to the small inner perfectionist that lives within me even though it's normally overshadowed by the stronger, ok with chaos side.  The Phoenix room was perfect in all regards.\n\nIt's a nice location too with plenty of good dining options within walking distance.  Should I have a trip to Phoenix in my future this Ritz will be high on the list for a place to stay.
0 ||| There are Dive BARS who possess a charming atmosphere due mostly to the regulars who frequent and a feeling of warmth and high hospitality. Bennetts McC was a horrible miss.\nI'm not going to write a lengthy review  but am compelled to hit on the basics of extreme horribleness and unprofessionalism.\nOn the evening of Oct 9, my good friend and I wanted a nibble and a cocktail somewhere close in the area. My friend grew up here so she knew of this dive bar and some who worked there so I was more than excited to try it out.\ni could go through the detail of the place but I need to get to the point on hand.\nWe sat at the half empty bar and were asked what we wanted to drink. The bar server never even smiled.\nAnother tall frown faced woman approached us as we asked for menus.\nThis woman recommended the special which she boasted she had created herself from homemade. I being a sucker for what sounded like homemade comfort food was wiling to give this a try.\nBefore out first drinks were even half way consumed, two plates (a shared meal) were thrust in front of us.\nThese plates held a ham slice that was thin and extremely dry. not unlike leather, canned gray string beans, an old biscuit which was a Pillsbury Grand around maybe 11 that morning, and this gummy mushy microwaved horrible bland macaroni and cheese plopped there with an \"I dare you to you to eat me\" kind of presence.\nUpon spying this sadness,I said aloud to my friend. \" I can't eat this\"....\nThe tall frown face server heard this and promptly snatched the plates away from us and started arguing taking the comment very personally. she was livid angry and tried to start a fight .all cause of this so called food.\nAt that point I paid for out two drinks as posted on the bill...(there was no food charge) and took my friend and left. \nI mean wow...is that really the way you run a business? I would have gladly just ordered something else.  ( i heard their burgers are great)\nVery rude both servers were, highly unpredicted unprofessional behavior and NO WAY acceptable as a way to generate customers and dollars. DIVE or not.
0 ||| Voucher #2518-6167\n\nI am seeking a refund for my voucher to Havana Cafe. Last night I went to Havana Cafe. When we entered the restaurant the hostess approached us and asked us if we had a reservation. We told her we did not and she said that they were booked up but we could eat in the bar. There were at least 6 tables open. It wasn't our first choice, but we said okay. We sat in the bar and the waitress took our drink order. After about 20 minutes the bar tender asked if our orders had been taken. We said no and he asked if he could get an appetizer started for us. We ordered our appetizers and waited for the waitress to come take our dinner order. While we waited, some other people came in and we heard them say that a 10-15 minute wait for a table was not too long. We asked them if they had a reservation and they said no, they just came in. A couple at the table next to us said they too had been told they couldn't eat in the dining room. While my friend went tell the waitress that we wanted a table, a waiter came to the table with 2 appetizers. He tried to give me the wrong one and I told him that the other one was ours. He walked away with both appetizers. I and someone at the table next mine tried to call him back but he kept going. The waitress finally came to take our orders. The appetizer waiter again came by with our appetizer and walked past our table twice. The waitress had to stop him and tell him to give it to us. We were finally moved to a table and waited for our food. When the food finally came, they brought all of the food at the same time, instead of bringing my friends salad before the entree. Also, my salad was nothing like what was listed on the menu and had ingredients that I am allergic to. I told the waiter that this was not the entree salad that I ordered and that I was allergic to some of the ingredients. At this point we asked to speak with the manager. After 10 minutes of watching the manager come in and out of the dining room, going around to talk to people at other tables we asked for the manager again. Our entrees were brought out to us. They brought the exact same salad to me and my friend's entree had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp. The waiter said that he would get the menu so he could show me that it was the right salad. The manager still hadn't come to us so my friend went to him. From across  the room, I could see from his body language that the manager was not in any way responsive to our issues. When my friend returned to the table, she told me that he was rude to her, until she mentioned that she knew the owner. The manager then came to our table. When we brought up the fact that my salad was nothing like anything on the menu and the fact that when we told the waiter that I was allergic to some of the unlisted ingredients, he apologized and said that sometimes the chef changes the ingredients and the menu isn't changed. I explained that this could be life threatening for some people.  He offered to have the salad remade, but at this point I was not confident in their care for allergy issues and declined. After 2 hours in the restaurant, we left without eating. The manager did end up giving us gift certificates for a return visit - it is highly unlikely that I will return.
4 ||| Good service and care. Went here withy girlfriend to get a pedicure that she forced me to do. I thought it was pretty good for my first time. I really liked the massage chairs while they cut my wicked man toe nails. Lol
4 ||| I recommend them highly!!  I took my 2 year old daughter for a sleep study and was very impressed.  Our sleep technician was amazing with her, very patient and kind.  The DVD we brought to watch while getting her hooked up got stuck in the TV and they vowed to return it.  We got a call the next day checking on our daughter and saying how sweet she was, they mentioned the DVD.  Several days later, we received the DVD plus a new copy of the Lion King with a nice note.  They are very good at what they do and if they can make a 2 year old feel at ease, they can probably do the same with anyone!!
2 ||| I pay about $126/month for high speed internet, contour 6 HD cable with HBO, and a phone line that I don't use (only bc it would've been the same price if I got everything a la cart. When I ordered the service I definite spoke to a really good hustler.\n\nPros- Internet is amazingly quick. Contour is a great feature but $$$.\n\nCons- I am trying to watch my DVR'ed shows and getting this \"Technical Difficulty\" message. I would rather not have to call to reset my box. This happens fairly often. Also, sometimes my TV shows get cut off at the end so I've gotten in the habit of extending the recording 5 mins past just to be sure. There have been times also where my shows just did not properly record. Searching for TV shows is a nuisance (having to type each show title) and going through window after window in order to set multiple show recordings or delete the show from the list. \n\nWhen I lived in San Diego I much preferred AT&T but unfortunately they do not service Las Vegas. The features they had of being able to reset your box via your computer, record options at 2 presses of a button, and just have a system that is more user friendly was just more convenient and less annoying. It was also much much more inexpensive.
1 ||| Everything about this place is great, with one crucial exception that makes it a deal-breaker.  There is a distinct \"wet-rag\" odor I've noticed that last several times I've eaten there.  Either they wipe the tables with dirty rags or the carpet is rotting.  It's gross and otherwise ruins one of my favorite places in town.  The menu items, design and service are all excellent.
1 ||| Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalape\u00f1o slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.
0 ||| The WRAPS are to die for!!  They make them in house. don't get the store bought pita.
4 ||| As good as it gets indeed! I've been to this spot before but only for a few drinks at the bar. I knew I wanted to come back and try the food as the place always had a good friendly vibe. I am so glad I finally did! The food was amazing. I'm from San Diego and my girlfriend is from El Paso, so we are very accustomed to the cuisine from both nearby border cities of Tijuana and Juarez. If you are looking for flavorful authentic Mexican dishes then Viva Zapatas is your spot! The service was top notch. Our waiter always made sure that we were well taken care of. When we were finished and asked for a box to go, the bus boy came over and packaged it up for us which was a very polite gesture. We will be back!
2 ||| The line was empty at the drive thru, yet the cashier had this pushy, rushed tone to her voice. I asked for an order of fries and a sprite. Once I got to the window, she took extra long to get to me even though there were no cars in front or behind me. I'll assume it was because she was taking great care with my order. Once I gave her my card she gave me my food, I collected my card, and I left. When I exited I looked to see if perhaps there was a car who was giving a long order and no no one was there. Oh well. It's fast food after all.
1 ||| Over rated on Yelp. Mediocre at best. Naan served hot but dry.  I love the aromatic spices used in Indian food but here the hot spices prevail making all the dishes taste the same. Mushroom mattar and vindoo chicken were good. Chicken masala sauce too thin. Saag Paneer below average. \n\nOverall there's much better in the valley. Unfortunately the best one closed last year.
4 ||| I love this place! They sure know about tires. Great staff. VASSIE is the greatest! go see him if you have any questions. He's very knowledable and extremely friendly. I won't take my car anywhere else!!  Reasonable prices also!!
4 ||| Good for the most part.  Umar Bowers is a nice guy, cares about his patients & their health and well being.  For this reason I would recommend him as a primary care doc.  He is knowledgeable, methodical, patient, & comprehensive.  One of the best primary care docs i've seen.\n\nOnly complaint is one of the personnel that draws blood in the lab.  He could have more of a customer service oriented attitude.  He tends to be abrasive & abrupt.  \n\nOverall, a fan of this practice!  Would recommend it!
0 ||| 7:53 happy your cold food really why these restaurants suck so freaking much thank god for good company
1 ||| Yes, the food is good - some things, like the Brie appetizer are even great. I wanted to try the lamb, the house speciality, but they were out. My date's pork was good - the risotto it came with was delicious. My sea bass was slightly overcooked and I didn't care for the relish it came with. I like the ambiance, my date disagreed - he thought it was loud - it's true we could hear all the conversations around us; but food and ambiance aside, my gripe is with CST's customer service.\n\nI purchased a $25 gift certificate for CDT on restaurants.com a month ago. When we went to redeem it, we were told, \"oh, i'm sorry, we don't honor those anymore...you should be able to contact restaurants.com and get a refund.\" End of story. No visit from the manager, no complimentary desert. Nothing.\n\nWe were not the only people that came in that night trying to use our certificate, the table next to us also had one. We went in that night because of the certificate - some people get them to try a new place - i got it cause i needed a little extra incentive to go back to CDT - I remembered the food being good but a bit pricy - $25 off seemed like a nice discount. Whatever, the reason, restaurants count on sites such as restaurants.com to bring in people to their establishments. We upheld our end of the agreement - we went in, ordered more  than just the 2 entree min (app, salad, corakge fee) but CDT did not uphold their end of the agreement - and in my opnion, that is horrible customer service. The certificate was supposed  to be good for a year - it's not like we tried  to use it close to the expiration date, I tried using it one month after purchasing it. Even worse is that CDT has not contacted restaurants.com to let them know that they are no longer honoring it.\n\nLuring customers with a gift certificate and not honoring it is a bad business practice.
3 ||| It's convenient, I'll give it that!\n\nWent here to get a bagel and a drink.  The bagel was mediocre, a little bit old but whatever.  The drink was overpriced, but whatever.  Then I saw a dessert bar.  Oooohhh!  That looked so good!   I asked the lady if there were nuts in it (I don't have an allergy, I just don't like nuts in my brownies or blondies....that doesn't make me a monster!  Or does it?)\n\nAnyway, she didn't know if there were nuts in it or not.  I manned up and got it anyway and it was delicious.  I didn't taste any nuts (no comments from the peanut gallery) so my vote says \"no nuts\".\n\nAnyway, if you need a bagel and you're nearby, this should meet your basic requirements.
4 ||| Great spot to have good food and hear great Mexican music.\n\nWhen one band stops the other continues.\n\nYou really don't have to pay for live music unless no one is asking to play a song.\n\nCheck this place out. You will have a great time.
2 ||| Happy hour is great if you can fight your way over to a seat at the bar. Otherwise, this place ain't that special.
1 ||| I have had Cox high-speed Internet for more than 10 years. The service is reliable and the technical support, when I have needed it, is awesome, so this would be a 5-star review if it wasn't for problems with Cox's online customer service. \n\nCox's website does not provide you with the ability to do basic account management tasks, like delete an expired credit card. Every other website I do business with allows you to view credit cards, and add and delete payment options. Because of this shortcoming, I had to call Cox's phone customer service (and you can only reach them during their business hours), step through the automated attendant, and ask a customer service rep to delete my expired credit card. \n\nI have had similar problems in the past that I should have been able to take care of online that I have had to call and ask a CSR to resolve. Frustrating for me, and expensive for Cox, so I would think they would address those kinds of issues.
4 ||| My mom used to hire Snappy to mow their huge lawn when I was a kid.  They really are true to their name.  They would show up and do the whole job in no time like a well-oiled machine.\n\nI just hired them to remove a bougainvillea and clean up my patio.  They showed up promptly and did the job fast for a good price.  Not only that, but the patio looks great.
1 ||| I came all the way from Columbus craving a Caribbean Passion smoothie. My excitement dwindled away with every minute I had to wait for my smoothie. Between one of the employees not knowing what to do without fresh orange juice (don't you just default to whatever orange juice they have) and the upset looks from all the other people who had been waiting for who knows how long... it ruined my experience. 18 minutes is way more than what I should have to wait for a smoothie. On the upside, it was tasty (only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1).
0 ||| I charged Blue Diamond with something pretty important to me: the re-sizing of my engagement ring. My ring, only 2 days old at the time, was, as it still is, more than a ring--it symbolized a lot of things. Future and present things. \n\nWhen I picked up my ring, a white gold piece, it fit. I was elated! I left with a smile and $45 less in my wallet. But a few days later, something  started to happen. My ring started to turn gold. Gold is not me. Plus, it was confusing.\n\nI ended up taking my wedding ring to a different jeweler and happened to show them my engagement ring. They let me know that the \"golding\" of white gold can be normal, but when a ring is re-sized, it should also be re-plated with rhodium. They took my engagement ring, fixed the sizing (which had also been broken) and re-plated it. Good as new.\n\nBlue Diamond was so convenient for me. They are a custom jeweler. They clearly know how to re-size a ring. But I felt let down. Let down enough to never return.
0 ||| I never thought I'd be reviewing a McDonald's, because I do not support McDonald's and am ashamed of myself every time I go, but I just have to say...I have been going to this McDonald's since it was first built. While their inside is pretty clean and nicely renovated, I never go inside, so my review is in regards to their drive through. I would say that 9 out of the 10 times that I go there, they mess up my order. I have just grown to expect that I won't get what I ordered. Ask for grilled chicken? You'll get crispy. Ask for coffee with no sugar? It will be sweet as hell. Oh, and also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that they NEVER fill up their fries all the way anymore! Good grief.
4 ||| This is our go-to place for when I don't feel like cooking. They have excellent panang, they satay is moist and flavourful, the chicken coconut soup is spicy and tangy and all around yummy, I'd also recommend their chili mint egg noodles with the shrimp. Their delivery is quick and reliable and the food is always hot when it arrives.
4 ||| Absolutely LOVE Peter Piper and have enjoyed this facility for years. Surprised I haven't YELP'd it before now but I guess it just never struck me to do so. \n\nGreat games that are always working. Easy for the littler ones to get tickets for the toys that you could buy in the dollar store but end up spending $20 to get...but I digress. \n\nPizza is addictive. I CRAVE the California Veggie which is my favorite and although it doesn't always fit in my diet plans, I do try to have it about once a month.  I've also had the wings, salads, and even the soft serve ice cream. All is very good.\n\nI've been to birthday parties here, held meetings here, and even had fundraisers here all with lots of success. This Peter Piper is very good to the community as well offering plenty of donations and opportunities to reward kids in schools.  \n\nThe staff here is friendly and nice. The management is helpful and eager to please.\n\nAll around 5 star location.
4 ||| I have a love hate relationship with this bar. I love the drinks specials but I hate the crowd. My friends love this bar so I come here for moral support and for some reason I can't pass up .25 cent drinks. For .25 cents you get what you pay for you probably get half a shot per drink but after 3 or 4 of these suckers you should have a good buzz. There is a weird mix of people here you've got the cowboys, hoochies, thugs, Scottsdale brats, and some regular people here and there. If you're young and single this is a good bar to hook up I always see people getting freaky on the dance floor. Stay for the bikini contest at midnight its very entertaining.
4 ||| I occasionally stop by Shanghai Express for lunch because it's right down the street from my office, the food is decent, the portions are good size, a lunch combo consisting of entree, rice, egg roll, and crab puff (cream cheese) is only $5.45 after tax, the service is always friendly and usually quick, the last time I went I was in an out in less than 10 minutes\n\nnot a bad choice for quick chinese if you find yourself around 33rd ave and Thomas
0 ||| This place is just around the corner from where I recently moved, and this was my first (and last) visit to this Jiffy Lube location.  From this experience, I imagine it will be a long time before I try any Jiffy Lube again, if ever.  Please keep in mind that I have managed an auto repair shop, and worked at a Jiffy Lube to put myself through college, so I am not unfamiliar with how a good shop should be run.  I went there today, because of it's location, and because I understood how convenient a well run Jiffy Lube can make my life - in and out in a jiffy, right?  Today, I waited idling in my car for 8 minutes before I was even acknowledged, after which I was finally directed to a lane to pull up to.  Once inside the waiting room, which is small, dingy, and uninviting, I waited patiently.  \n\nFor the next 50 minutes I waited to get a simple oil change - and they did not even vacuum the inside of the car, telling me that it was because their vacuum was broken, and the windshield wasn't even cleaned well.  It was as though this place was run and staffed by high schoolers, who were more interested in playing grab-ass, than in serving their customers.  I watched as the manager of the shop was casually talking and dancing in the bay area, which only added to  their less than professional image, and displayed no sense of urgency at all.  \n\nIn the end, I was checked out by one of the workers, and I asked him why it took 50 minutes to get an oil change when there were only two vehicles in line ahead of me (one in each bay), and his response was, and I quote, \"We had other things to do.\"  In that instant, I decided that I would never go back.  I told the young man that I would not be coming back, and his response was an aggressive, \"OK!\"  \n\nSo here is my take on it all - they don't care about you, or the business you bring them; therefore, don't give it to them.  I value customer service highly, as a provider and as a consumer, and this place failed miserably.  I know I won't give them another dollar from my wallet, or another minute of my time.  I called the corporate office and let them know about my poor experience, but, honestly, if they are willing to tolerate that environment in the first place, then I have very little hope of anything being done to change the situation.  My advice is to just go some place else and save yourself the headache.
4 ||| This place is THE park to go to if you have kids, visiting family or want an outdoor venue for a party. It's the perfect place to spend an afternoon with the fam! I found this park when my sister, bro in law and my almost 2 year old nephew came to town. Like most little ones, my nephew is fascinated by trains so we figured this was a good spot to check out. By the dazed, overwhelmed yet excited look in my nephew's eyes...he agreed.\n\nFirst off, it's easy to locate and prices for rides/attractions are cheap. The train ride is great for the kiddos and the line may look long but it goes fast. There's a carousel, playgrounds, food, souvenir shop and museums to peruse all afternoon. Some really cool photo ops too with the real trains, tracks and station building. The park has some really great shelters for hosting a party or bbq. Also, you can rent the inside of one of the trains for a private party...we peeked inside as a party was getting set up and it's absolutely adorable. Perfect for a little one's celebration if he/she is a fan of choo-choo's!
4 ||| Love, love, love this place--not only because they saved and renovated an old grocery store, but because their food ROCKS! \nSandwiches, salads, pizza and a few desserts (which I am NOT wild about once tasted, but they are pretty, if you know what I mean).\nI am sold on the Italia salad, as well as the Farmers salad, oh, and the Picnic salad. My hubby loves the sandwiches (because for some reason, he won't be caught eating a salad in public). \nThey have some good, inexpensive wines, also. I've never tried any of the beers there but it doesn't seem like it would go well with my salad. \nThe salads are good size, but not overwhelming. Try one, you'll LOVE it!
0 ||| I joined Yelp specifically to say this: The Grandview Saloon was one of the worst culinary experiences of my life.  I would rather lick the grease off the tracks of the Duquesne Incline next door than suffer through another meal here again.\n\nThe entire Grandview concept appears to be premised on the belief that as long as you've got a phenomenal view, you can charge inflated prices for food you'd be offended to find in a middle school cafeteria. In general, the food I saw was all-American in the worst possible sense - bland, slimy, and whenever possible, smothered with cheese.\n\nIn our case, the chicken marsala recipe eschewed the traditional topping for some kind of watery combination of ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The shrimp scampi tasted as if it was prepared by a chef without a tongue. Our request for pita chips that were simply warm, not fried, elicited a significant delay from the kitchen, as if they couldn't figure out why any of their customers wouldn't want to slurp up something lathered in butter and oil.\n\nFrankly, we should have run out the door the moment we sat down.  My brother-in-law aptly described the decor as a Days Inn ballroom circa 1995.  The walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them.  Of course, you've got an incredible view of the downtown skyline, but that's no excuse for such hideous decorative malfeasance.  After all, Vincent van Gogh didn't frame Starry Night in particle board he pulled from a dumpster.\n\nIf you've got even one iota of romantic feeling left after surveying what must surely be an accurate replica of Purgatory, the Top 40 hits from five year ago blaring over the soundtrack will surely kill the mood once and for all.  While you enjoy the strains of Pink's \"Get the Party Started,\" you'll be left munching on beer-battered blobs, silently wondering why your life feels so empty and numb.\n\nTo think that I paid almost $70 here for a two-person dinner that didn't even include alcohol makes me want to gnaw off my own pinkie with rage.  That experience would be tastier, cheaper, and far more pleasant than my time at Grandview.  However, my sacrifice will only achieve some higher meaning if I can serve as a warning to the rest of humanity.  For a great night out, check out the free view from the public observation point a few doors down, and then eat in literally any other restaurant in Pittsburgh.
0 ||| Service was terrible and staff was very unfriendly!
1 ||| Underwhelming food.\n\nMy gyro platter was just okay. It came w/ a tomato-based sauce that I thought didn't go well w/ the meat. Asked for a side of tzatziki sauce instead but the flavor wasn't very good.\n\nDon't think I will be back.
4 ||| Love the blue margarita!
0 ||| This Subway is the absolute worst! The staff of this place is so strange. They have the weirdest people working at this location. They are so creepy that I will never go back, This Subway is close to my house and I go out of my way several miles to go to another location. They all seem annoyed when you come into the store, half of them are usually in front of the store smoking. When they make your food, they sloppily throw it together, this place sucks! Do yourself a favor, go to another location. I have tried to contact the owners to tell them how uncomfortable the staff makes people feel but can't seem to find a phone number.
4 ||| Oh Chipotle, what's not to love honestly?  Great quality ingredients that you can have thrown together in a completely customizable meal, it's hard to go wrong with that set up.  I managed to stop in at a rare time when they didn't have a huge line and made my way up to the counter.  The people behind the counter greeted me with a smile and a \"hello\" right away, and proceeded right away to get my order taken care of.  The girl who rang me up was very friendly too and even put a smiley face on my container!  Call me a sucker for the small stuff but I love things like that!
2 ||| Really cool rainbow lights when you drive down the freeway at the evening time. Parking seem to be really difficult unless you want to pay the price for VIP designs are really fast.
2 ||| Plenty of fun knick-knacks here.  Unique items for home decor.  Check out the wine section for good prices on some interesting selections.
1 ||| Just finished a 3 week stay here.  When we made the reservation, we were told that renovations were being done, but that work was already complete in the building we would be in and that any work would be done between 9 am and 5 pm. Not true. We had a remodeled room, which was nice, but work was being done on a room 2 doors down from us.  Also, I was woken up by trucks before 6 am on several occasions and work routinely went until 6:30 or 7 pm.  The water and the elevator were also shut down for hours at a time multiple times during our stay and I found a baby scorpion in my room. \n\nHowever, the worst is that my wedding ring went missing from my room. I wasn't wearing it because it needed to be resized, and I only had it with me because we relocated. Had I known there was a safe at the front desk, I would have stored it there, but I was never told. Staff and management treated me like I was lying when I reported it missing. The response I got multiple times was \"we have a very trustworthy staff.\"  They took a report that they sent to corporate, but admitted that nothing would be done with the report unless they noticed \"a pattern of missing items\".  So apparently the first theft isn't really investigated or punished, great policy! For the rest of our stay any staff members who knew about the report treated us awkwardly while the housekeepers barely cleaned our room & didn't even replace missing items like shampoo or dishwasher detergent. Many of the staff members (especially the breakfast lady, Debbie) were very friendly, but this doesn't make up for the rest of the problems.
0 ||| I was very exited to try Sonoma for the first time only to be left in disappointment. Last night I was in a groups of 6 we ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer. It was actually very good, just rather small. Then I order the surf and turf special and my GF orders the top Sirloin. I ordered my food med rare and she orders hers med well. It took 53 minutes from completing our order to having it on the table in front of us. \nAfter it arrive my steak an lobster were both cool, a littler cooler than room temp as was my GF's steak. \nIt is very disappointing to go to a self proclaimed high end steak house and be served food with the quality of Applebee's. I hope this was just a bad experience. As a whole the group was disappointed and I will never eat there again.
4 ||| Pulled pork...tasty!  Cole slaw...crispy and fresh. Value...well worth the reasonable prices.  The place is a dive and never seems too terribly clean to me.  But who cares if the food's good?  The kind of place I will return to when I'm cravin' bbq and don't feel like a lot of fuss but I hesitate to recommend to others.
0 ||| i find i can no longer be a customer at salon christine. christine's conduct/attitude toward me regarding my valid question about aveda products possibly reverting back to animal testing was rude, unprofessional, and insulting. not only did she not respond to my facebook question on her salon's page, but only after an email to her, did she reply with a curt answer, and to add insult to injury, she's banned me from further posting/commenting on the salon's facebook page. i didn't realize an inquiry regarding a product for which i'm paying wasn't permitted. instead of setting the record straight (which should've been done), she elected to ignore my question, delete it from facebook, and then ban me from the salon's page. wow. that said, i'll really miss katie, as she's a great hairstylist and colorist.
4 ||| I came here to get my car washed and I had no idea what I was doing. Everyone I spoke to was so helpful and patient! My car is my baby and they took good care of her. :)
4 ||| Had a little day date with my boyfriend. I got The Quiche of The Day (spinach, mushroom & Chicken) which was AMAZING!!! Came with a side salad. My boyfriend had the Honey Pecan Chicken with broccoli casserole and mash potatoes. Everything was wonderful. Looking forward to going back here soon
4 ||| this is a good place to get stuff like toys leashes and collars. they are more affordable than your small mom and pop shops. as far as dog food goes you are better off going to wag n wash they are at least 10 bucks cheaper if not more
0 ||| I waited 3 hours and 15 mins just for a realignment. I was there seating..waiting for 2 hrs and then i saw my car still in the parking area. Then i ask them if my car is done already..and after 10-15mins they took my car..after 30 mins i went to check on my car but it wasnt there where they fix the cars so i asked where is my car and then they said it should be ready in 30 mins. But i waited for more minutes. Shame. Poor customer service. I guess their priority that time was the uber people who was there to let their 'future drivers'  have their car be approved before driving for uber. I don't know smh.
4 ||| I went here for the first time today and I loved it! The people were great, the atmosphere was inviting, and the salon was super clean. Really affordable and the only only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there seemed to be some confusion about what type of manicure I was getting, so I ended up having to wait after my pedicure was finished. Everything was great after it was all sorted out though! I will definitely go back!
0 ||| I don't like being negative, but I don't mind telling the truth. The most mediocre Pho I've ever had. And some of the crappiest service around...unless you're asian. \n\nI absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. Our waiter was a jerk! In the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. Both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. Come on!!! White people can't use chopsticks? \n\nOur waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down? \n\nAnd my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalape\u00f1os, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha. \n\nAnd I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. \n\nIt's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town. \n\nAll in all...I'm not recommending this place if you want good Pho or if you're not asian? I totally don't understand the reviews. Because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something.
0 ||| TERRIBLE SERVICE AND HORRIBLE RETURNS. \nDEHYDRATED SPINES ON THEIR BOOKS, CAUSING THEM TO BREAK. \n(they must store their books improperly)\n\nAfter getting half way through a book, it broke. All at once. So I took it in for a return.... the pages are in good condition, I did not take it in the water, or have it under any duress. This paperback book is completely falling apart. The cover is completely off the book, and the book itself split in 3 pieces. \nThe spine is clearly dehydrated. \nThe day this book broke, I took it in to just get a replacement, not a refund, just replaced, so I could continue to read it. \nI was told I was 4 DAYS outside of my return policy, The checker said it shouldn't be a problem but she needed to check. \n\nThe manager said she could not take it. This Manager has worked for the company for 18 years, as she expressively told me. Her name is Kathleen.\nI was stunned by the abrupt manner in which she dealt with me. The manager was rude, short and clipped with me. She was almost looking for a fight, which stunned me. She was unhelpful, and was telling me it was my fault.... of the thousands of books I've read, never in my entire life have I ever seen a book fall apart like this. \n\nI am outside of my 15 days because I bought 2 books at that time, in a series. I cant read 900+ pages of 2 books in 15 days. They could see that on my account.\n\nHow I was treated in store was unbelievable. \nI will not shop at any barnes and noble. Their lack of customer care was appalling. I will find somewhere else to purchase books. \n\nI also called, seeing if we could do anything and the manager was awful on the phone,  she actually said \"if you had a receipt maybe it would be different...\" I told her I DID have a receipt, and had told the cashier that. \nThen, she hung up on me.
0 ||| If you like long waits, over priced sushi then this is the place to go. Their menu was laking a lot of basic Sushi. Big disappointment as I was a Sushi Fien that night but not enough to eat the sushi they brought. Also, my friend (Ms. adventurous) ordered Chicken Teriyaki... now we know that is a pretty simple dish. Not for them! A  huge bowl of white rice with a minimal amount of cold chicken and I'm not sure what kind of sauce that was but it wasn't teriyaki. Although most meals come with tea, you have to ask for it. They won't offer it. There was another item that you had to request as well. I say BooOOOooooOOOOOOooo!!!  The only thing that might be worth it is the Sake. I didn't have any but a lot of the patrons had Sake on their tables and they all seemed to be on a good one..
3 ||| I went on a Saturday and was the first one there.\n\nA friendly lady welcomed us and sat us in a teppanyaki table. A family of four showed up and shared the table with us.\n\nWe had edamame, veggie tempura, and shrimp and filet lunch.\n\nWe could skip the tempura.\n\nThe food was good, above average but nothing impressive.\n\nThe down part is that the chef barely did an effort to impress. I like to go to that kind of places for the show since I'm pretty picky when it comes to Japanese food. And if there's no show at all... \n\nAlso the bidding feels old. It feels like going into a 1980's restaurant (I guess that's what they fueled back in the day, I'll ask my grand ma, ha ha).\n\nDecent food, decent prices, no show (at least in my visit)
0 ||| This location always has terrible service. Literally just got ignored for 15 minutes while standing, waiting to place our order. It's even worse when being ignored by employees walking by, refusing to make eye contact. Thank god rally's is right down the street, left sonic and went there instead. This sonic location needs to step it up or close down.
4 ||| After a long morning meeting at the beautiful August Wilson Center on Liberty Ave. My coworkers and I needed food ASAP! We decided to go right across the street to Mahoney's! It didn't look like it would be pricey or the food would be bad. \n\nAs you walk in you immediately see the bar area with TVs and Bar stools, as you walk in a little further the tables are set up in the back with plenty of room. A different set up that you don't see often, but I really liked it. \n\nThe food was typical bar food, but with a little more pizazz. The 1/2 sandwich soup and sandwich combo was actually smaller than I had hoped. The food itself was not too bad. Not my favorite. The French Onion soup was a bit salty and the mayo for the sandwich seemed warm. I tried the fries which were good but a bit too greasy for my taste. \n\nMy friend's Greek salad however was very tasty. It had a great mixture of greens, feta cheese and even potatoes! \n\nThe staff was nice and the prices were good. \n\nA place I would go back to but not regularly. Maybe try a happy hour there?
4 ||| I do not like pickles, but Penguin's fried pickles with Ranch are amazing! As with any good restaurant there will probably be a line, but it is definitely worth the wait!
0 ||| This place is horrible!  I initially used them since I started in real estate in 1997. Never had any problems until my last order which took over a month for them to complete. I had to constantly call and was just given the run around and transferred to a different person each time. I don't know what's going on at this place but they do not conduct business in a professional manner. I finally lost it after calling to check on my order which was promised to be done on a certain day (again!). The manager threatened to cancel my order and hang up on me. Granted I was yelling at him but before that I had been more than patient and understanding. The order did finally get done after I screamed at them but it will be my last with them. Besides all this their prices aren't the best around. They had all my art work so it was a simple order with no changes.
4 ||| Asahi is the kind of bakery you go to when you get a sudden craving for Japanese and Chinese pastry.  Unlike most American and European pastries, Asian baked goods are normally;y a lot less sweeter and favor whipped creams instead of frosting.  Yum!\n\nAnyways, while their selection is quite amazing, I mainly go there for their rolled cakes [Swiss rolls?].  The coffee roll is amazing!  And with such a low price, it's hard not to like this place.
4 ||| Very good egg flower soup! And authentic dishes... Staff is awesome.
4 ||| Home away from home.  Love it.
0 ||| No go. Bought the Groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try. The location, atmosphere, and service were all good so no complaints there. The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste, was way too thick, and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chicken/cabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes, but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back.
2 ||| this was my first visit. there were a variety of items on the menu. you could order from a selection of sandwiches, which seemed fairly priced at $5.50-$7-ish or create your own ... but for the create your own,  you got charged for every little thing, including 45 cents for each veggie, which seemed a bit odd. you could easily create a $9 or $10 sandwich, without a side or a drink. there were lots of sides including  pasta salad, chips, asian noodles, and some yummy, homemade desserts. it was a bit chilly so soup was in order. i had the sonoran rojo clam chowder, which was not at all what i was expecting. the broth was very thin, not thick like clam chowder normally is. there was a plethora of vegetables and huge chunks of potato and a minimal amount of rubbery clams. it looked more like vegetable soup than any chowder i've ever had. i also ordered a side of asian noodles, which appeared to be angel hair pasta, some sesame seeds and a very artificial asian marinade. i got a free chocolate chip cookie, which was small and hard, but free so can i really complain? both items i ordered were odd. the soup was better than the noodles. maybe i ordered the wrong items? counter service was simply unfriendly. i wasn't impressed, but i'd like to like this place. i'll probably try it one more time, ordering a sandwich, when i'm in the area, very hungry, and in the mood to spend $10 or $15 on lunch.
4 ||| This is a great spot for local UNCC students or a nice place to go and hang out with friends or your significant other.  It is a great place to watch whatever game you want because they have tons of TVs as well as the largest projection TV I have seen thus far in Charlotte.  I have only tried the wings and the pizza and they are definitely on point.  The pizza is oven baked, so it has a unique taste that only Picasso's can provide.  I would give it five stars if the service was a little more consistent.  Sometimes you will sit down at a table and it takes forever for someone to come over, while at other times the service is stellar.  If you are looking for awesome pizza or wings in the University area, this is your spot.
2 ||| been traveling a lot lately and this was one of our stops.  we booked the aloft W down the street and those posers, actually sold our room out from under us and, as a 'sorry' comp'ed us a room at the Hilton here.... now, first off, if you're going to say sorry with a comp, why wouldn't it be a nice hotel.  not that the hilton isn't 'nice' but it's not quite at the level of the aloft.  so why not find a comparable suite?  anyway, that's a dig at the aloft and i don't want it to influence the hilton.\n\ni hesitate to give this place only 3 stars because what else do you really expect from this place. it's very clean and orderly. service is good. room is BASIC. no frills. they have an iron so you can iron your wrinkled shirts before going off to your meetings in the morning. hair dryer works. hot water. room is quiet. etc, etc.... they COULD spare a thicker blanket as i had to turn the heat up in the room to sleep comfortably because the blankets where _thin_... but oh well.\n\nand i should take a moment to point out the breakfast buffet was unusually good.  not a massive selection but there were 9 staff down there waiting on about 8 customers hand and foot.  i was playing with teh waffle-maker, about to make myself a waffle, and one staff member jumped in front of me (at the SELF-SERVICE waffle-maker) and said: \"no problem, sir, i'll make that for you and bring it to your table.\"  amazing. the food was 3 star but the service was 5. the room was 3 stars but the service at the front desk from 4.  so again, i wonder if i should round to 4 but it's ultimately a holiday inn, a basic room.  so it's good for what it is but not a ton more.
3 ||| The pros: \n- fresh ingredients\n- attention to detail \n- variety of foods, snacks, goodies and drinks\n\nThe cons:\n- expensive\n- location / parking inconvenient\n\nBrief review:\nAll in all, a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside. Friendly, prompt service. Clean tables. Great atmosphere!  The only real problem is your wallet is going to be much, much lighter after you leave.  If you're going because you're hungry and you want value, this isn't your place.  If you're going to hang with friends to relax and enjoy the day, I think you'll enjoy the place.
0 ||| RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED!!!!\n\nYou can go to Panda Express RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET, get 3X more AND pay less. Seriously, chow mein for $12 that comes in a little to-go box?! HIGHWAY ROBBERY! and it didn't even taste THAT GREAT! \nI got home and realized they didn't even pack utensils or a napkin. Miffed... \n\nI should have known when I took a look at their to go menu.
0 ||| Welcome to my exclusive 1-star club, Mr. Roberts.\n\nI went here to see a friend's band play, despite my boyfriend's warning that it was not the greatest bar.  I do so love dive bars--how bad could it be?\n\nBad.  It's so bad.  It's past the stage of being a fun dive bar, it's just plain frightening.  The people looked like the kind of scary, angry drunks you would only encounter in a movie.  The bathroom stall was so little that had I weighed 20 pounds more, I probably would have gotten wedged in (the door opened inward, not outward).\n\nWe did not stay long, I did not regret it, and won't be back.  Ick, yuck, blech, and ptooey.  Why would anyone think this is a good place?!
4 ||| Just needs a H&M to be my complete mall. All the other must have stores make their appearances plus a corridor for luxury names that let me dream a little (including Hermes). \n\nMy favorite find was the Lilly Pulitzer store. I rarely see those! I also like the bright and clean upscale layout. All the sunlight makes it feel like an outdoor mall. The drive south from Uptown isn't too bad either. You've got to love Sharon Road.
4 ||| Qdoba was kind of an after thought for me.  With Salsaritas and now Chipolte near by, I stopped in to the Qdoba location just because it was convenient as I was going to another business in the same shopping center.  The manager was outgoing and enthusiastic, and recomended the Mexican Gumbo.  I have not looked back since.  I dine there at least once a week now, sometimes more, as this dish is truly addicting.  It is a big bowl with beans, and rice if you desire, a wonderfully spicy tomato sauce base.  I add chicken, pico di gallo, habanero salsa, cheese and top it off with tortilla strips.  It is a healthy, filling meal that is over the top delicious.  I still like Chipolte and Salsaritas, but they don't have anything on Qdoba's Mexican gumbo.  Yum-just yum!
0 ||| I never liked or disliked the Come Back In - it's a typical bar and has good beer choices.  They always offered me a chance for my band and I to play there, and exposure is always good.  However, I never liked the manager, since all he does every time is yell at his staff and glare at everyone.  He really creeps me out, the way he's always staring and crap.  Anyway, last time we were there, it was below zero outside.  We noticed a dick patron had left his yellow lab in his car with the windows all up and no blanket just to go inside and drink (people like that should never own anything that relies on them, btw) and he had been in the bar for a long time, because the windows were all nearly frosted over.  I mentioned this to the manager since he checked my ID at the door, and he said, \"Who the fuck cares, it's a damned dog,\" and shooed me inside.  1. that is freaking RUDE to say to a CUSTOMER.  2. yes it is a dog, but that is animal cruelty.  I got a seat with my friends and kept an eye on the guy.  Sure enough, just like all other times, he yelled at his staff and glared at the customers, doing nothing else.  The cops showed up then and talked to him and he was pissed as all hell that someone (no, it wasn't me lol) called the cops to his establishment.  And yes, it was about the dog in the car in negative degree weather.  I was close enough to the situation to over hear it, and the guy was a dick to the cops too, saying things like \"I don't f*cking care,\" and \"who called you?!  Tell me!\"  This guy is a real piece of work.  After the cops left, I decided I 1. never want to come here again unless it is managed by a more decent person and 2. never will accept their offer for my band to play in a place that is managed by this guy, who obviously hates his job, customers, staff and, well, life.  Until he is gone, I will never set foot in that place again.  And, as I was leaving (he was yelling at staff at that time), I told him just that.  He told me to f*ck off.  Now keep in mind I was always polite in what I was saying to him.  No customers should be treated this way.  I don't care if you don't care about the dog in the car, this review is based on how rude the guy is and how he should be told off and hopefully never comes back to work again.
4 ||| Can't beat the price, $2.25.  Wide selection of movies. Friendly staff!  Good location.
2 ||| It seemed like my brisket should've tasted good, but it was swimming in sauce that they pour over it. The sauce was good and spicy, but sometimes I just want to taste the meat. My sides of macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, and cornbread really left much to be desired and really brought out the cafeteria quality of this place.
4 ||| This a review for the location on Guadalupe and Baseline.  It doesn't seem to be on Yelp.  Anyway YUM!  The second we walked in my mouth watered it smelled so good.  We were sat down immediately and the service was great.  The salad was eh but edible.  The pizza muffins were divine!  We ordered six and they brought 8 which is always fun.  We devoured them with the yummy Bruschetta type sauce that came with it.  In addition we got cheese ravioli with meat sauce and chicken fettuccini alfredo and breadsticks.  The breadsticks were good though a little dry for my taste.  But in general  YUM YUM YUM!!!  The best Italian I have had in the Gilbert/Mesa/Chandler/Tempe/Awatukee area by far!
4 ||| The fact that this is a bistro, with sizable attached wine shop with deals for and ease of opening at your table and the great setting make this a regular favorite place of mine.  Tasty food in the French/Creole style.  An impressive wine selection which is ever changing.  A spectacular patio lakeside with misters in the warm months and enclosures and heaters in the cold months, so you can always dine al fresco.  It's a beautiful spot and many nights they feature live music.  Check it out!
3 ||| They have a interesting selection of food stuff here and non-food stuff here, the drawback IMO is they tend to be on the more expensive side, But they have stuff that you dont see at other grocery stores. \nIf you dont mind higher prices and snooty yuppie people not a bad place to go.
4 ||| I have dinned here quite a bit and I don't have one bad thing to say.\nI can't not have a orgasmic sensation run through me when I eat here. \nYou could probably order anything and it would be good.\n\n*Awesome cheese selections-Hook's 12 year will haunt you forever to eat. Love how they garnish and present their dishes(not just cheese plates)\n*Soups are impressive and very tasteful \n*Entrees are always changing and bring new flavors to try\n*Their desserts will make you make noises when you eat them-Sorbets are mouth watering, excellent flavor combinations \n* Great wine list as well-Australian Shiraz will hit the spot if your a fan\n\nTruly a great experience every time you dine there. Their special dinners and benefit dinners are a must to try. It's simply clear that L'Etoile strides for pure goodness in every plate that is served.
3 ||| My husband and I headed over early on a Tuesday night.  To our surprise it is buy one get one tapas until 7 so upon realizing our luck we opted for 4 items to test the place out.  We were glad we did.\n\n1)  Chicken satay: chicken was tender and the seasonings were minimal but the peanut sauce looked like it was scooped out of a jar, was thicker than peanut butter with a sticky texture.\n2) Lucky 7 Roll: The menu says that it is homemade, but if it is I think it has since been reheated.  It had an interesting mix of flavors but the outside tasted more like a thin corn taco.\n3) Crostini (Filet Mingon): 3 small, flavor and lifeless filets over jam on a white bread crostini.\n4) Souvlaki (beef skish-kabobs): Again, light on flavor, over cooked.\n\nI don't recommend this place, at least for tapas and I won't go back for a full dinner but the atmosphere was laid back, the service was very good and if you work in the area it seems like a good spot to stop in for a drink.  That said, living in 4th ward there are so many other choices on my walk between here and there, I probably won't make it intentional to go back.
4 ||| I have been a going to Ted's since 1999 when I moved to AZ and absolutely love the all beef hotdog and the burgers are juicy and delicious. Their malts are really thick and to die for. You might need a spoon or let it melt a little because they can be a little thick at times. Best hotdog restaurant I have come across in AZ, hands down.
3 ||| I had a pretty good steak here.  Out of the five of us, I was the only one not thoroughly pleased.  The medium rare they gave me was a bit too medium for me, but the flavor was good.  \n\nThere are a lot of cute girls working there, and our waitress was attentive and courteous.  If I lived in the area, and was perhaps a bit younger, that alone would probably bring me back.  \n\nYou can't make reservations, but you CAN call ahead.  That saved us a good 20 minutes. They were also spot on with their estimate, even though the lines were out the door.
0 ||| While the Sam's in Matthews holds a special place for us because of Pakman, the Sam's in the University is a little different - I'm not sure I'll understand why every Sam's has just a slightly different layout, but it really gets annoying.\n\nSome stores you can go into and it's like each one is identical.  Not Sam's.  When you walk into Sam's, it's like you're in a different store.  Sure, it's a warehouse, but they each have their own unique personality, and the University store has plenty.\n\nThe staff here just aren't as friendly as the ones in Matthews, so if you're going to just browse, do it in Matthews - though you can certainly browse, it just doesn't have the same cozy feel.
4 ||| Great food, fast service and the price is right. Perfect stop for a quick lunch in the downtown area.
4 ||| If you're going to Le Studio, definitely, definitely, ask for Shannon. \n\nI've been seeing her for a few years now, followed her from her last salon to Le Studio. I even flew back in from California while on break to have her do my hair. I have dark hair that has been bleached to a light blonde, and let me say that it is rare that someone has it come out the way that I like it. However, Shannon manages to do it perfect every time. She's fantastic and such a doll. I even had my mom start seeing her for haircuts as well. Le Studio is a great place, the location is in downtown Mesa which is a little far from me, but I'd make the drive.
4 ||| Yummm
0 ||| I've taken 2 of my dogs to Dr Kile and a couple puppies.  He has no people skills and neither do a couple of his staff gals.  He mis-diagnosed one of my dogs and I paid a ton for his services and medication for a treatment that did nothing.  At one point the doctor even argued with me and would never listen to what I had to say.  When asking about a treatment for another of my dogs, I was insulted by Dr Kile.  I will NEVER bring a single dog back to this place which is sad cause their office is so close to my home.
4 ||| This place will not leave you going home hungry! The portion sizes are huge and I almost always take something home as left overs. The vodka sauce is one of the best sauces they make. \nThey have nightly specials, but go early if you want the specials because everyone in the area knows which specials are on which night and they sell out quickly! \nSome of my favorites include the salmon salad, chicken and peppers and the scrod.
1 ||| The positive reviews baffle me to be honest. I gave the place every chance in the world to impress me with something, anything, yet nothing was up to standard. About the only nice thing I can say is that the people working there are very friendly. Let's get right into the food.\n\nWe ordered two types of beef, chicken, shrimp and appetizers. Prices are typical for Chinese, as in not very low. Drinks tasted of rubber tubing and tap water, which is about what I expect these days. Right off, the first caution sign is the large menu. These types of restaurants often have a lot of options, but for a place of this size, it feels excessive. I don't see how they can possibly have that amount of fresh food on hand and be able to turn it over fast enough to keep the stock from aging. When the appetizers arrived, I could tell right away that they were cooked from frozen, which made me wonder just how much stock was in the freezer back there.\n\nLittle did I know that was going to be the highlight of the meal. The main entrees appeared smaller than usual, and not very... appetizing. Being good sports, we dug in and learned just what we were dealing with: super cheap meats. One of the beef entrees was the toughest, chewiest, grisliest nasty cuts I've ever experienced. Not fork, nor knife, nor sharpest tooth could properly wear this stuff down. It shouldn't take minutes to cut meat off the bone and then another ten just to chew it down into a manageable enough wad that it can be swallowed whole. I don't exaggerate when I say I've had old beef jerky that was easier to eat. I'm willing to bet steel-toed boots are softer on the jaw.\n\nThe other beef, the chewable softer one, had none of the flavor you look for in a cow. Rarely can I not identify what I'm eating, but this one felt way too much like a mystery to me. I'm not implying it wasn't beef, but it most definitely wasn't quality. The person at my table eating this plate felt quite sick afterward. Not exactly a quality I prize in an eatery.\n\nThen there's the chicken, the most accessible of the bunch. Yet even that was exclusively dark meat of not the greatest sort. Despite it looking off and tasting below-par, compared to the beef it was the prettiest girl at this dance. As for the shrimp, it's great if you like the digestive tract completely intact. Mmm, crustacean poop.\n\nEating here stuck with me the rest of the day, in the form of vicious stomach cramps and a foul taste in my mouth that nothing seemed to clean away. I'm sure there must be something they do well, but we managed to completely avoid it.
3 ||| I usually hit this place on Mondays for their lunch special.  The burger and fries are some of the best I've ever had but the wait is what kills it.  I've never been in there and gotten my food in less than 45 minutes, going to lunch here usually takes about an hour fifteen.  The waitresses are also friendly but stay at the bar, a couple times I've had to go up front to get their attention so I can pay and leave.
4 ||| Very good prices for food, and it's great! Wonderful service as well. I also love their selections of breads, meats, cheeses, etc, etc!\n\nSome of the items in the store (not on the menu) are a bit overpriced. Also, when I have taken my sandwich home, it didn't last very long and wasn't nearly as good as it was in the restaurant.
3 ||| My Florist is cooler than it is good. I think most people dig this place because it's downtown, close to \"the arts\" and has a funky name. Other than that it's kind of just okay.\n\nThe food is really overpriced for what you get. It's not like I'm cheapie McCheap - I'm happy to pay whatever - but I expect something worthwhile in return. The food is aight. The service is aight. Everything is aight.\n\nIt's not BAD, just overrated. Maybe grossly. I'll eat here from time to time, but I won't go out of my way.
1 ||| I hate that this is the closest location to my house. I love Chipotle, since it's easy to cobble together a pretty healthy meal. First, the parking situation leaves a lot (of spaces) to be desired. Second, this location seems to always be overstaffed, but very inefficient. The last couple of times I've gone, there's been an employee in between the food assemblers and the cashier whose only functions seem to be greeting people who walk in the door and making sure all the paper bags are folded before handing them to the customer. She creates an unnecessary delay between ordering food and said food making its way to my belly. Third, they seem to always be out of something. Last time, it was chicken. How they didn't have another batch of chicken ready to go, I have no idea. The way they dealt with the problem was inefficient, as per usual.\n\nI think I'm about ready to drive the same distance in the other direction to Qdoba.
1 ||| OK, so we went back tonight for dinner.. I have to say, I was pretty peeved that they raised their prices.  So, now when I ordered just ONE shrimp taco, it came out to 4.90 with tax and all - are you flippin' kidding me!?!?!  It's about 5 shrimp, chipotle cream salsa, red cabbage, and corn tortilla for FIVE DOLLARS.  No way... I mean, they're pretty damn good tacos for being hundreds of miles away from the shore, but 5 dollars for ONE taco?  That's a bit presumptuous. \n\nLike I said before, I'm not expecting .99c value meal prices.. but I'm also not paying Scottsdale prices for a taco.
0 ||| Me & some friends came here for lunch but an hour pass by & we never received our food... we end up leaving because our lunch time was over... never coming back to this restaurant
2 ||| Amina has moved over to Snapdragon, so that's the spot.  Losing a star because a star left....
4 ||| This place is a bit schizophrenic.I am staying at the hotel for a week so I am here enough to say that  they serve a good breakfast with a friendly breakfast staff.
1 ||| I have been back for two weeks now and am finally starting to finish up all of my reviews. \n\nHad lunch here with 2 other friends from high school. We met around 11:30 and left at 1:30. Long leisurley lunch. They shared a bottle of rose'. Pink wine-blech. Reminded me of our high school days when wine coolers and Stawberry Hill were all the rage (and all we could buy w/out a fake id).\n\nThe food is the same as it always is. Decent, not great and the biscuits are really the only thing worth coming back for. Our server was kind of obnoxious trying to do the \"up sell\" at every turn. \n\nAnother chain, another day in Phoenix...
4 ||| When you think of a nice Italian restaurant, you don't think it would come in a strip mall, but Mama Ricotta's bucks the trend. Not only does the atmosphere & decor give the impression of a nicer Italian place, the food is pretty good.\n\nWhile you may be thinking that this is a dinner only place, this is actually a really popular lunch place. There is usually a line during lunch, but it moves pretty quickly, especially if the outside seating is open. While the food can be a tad on the pricey side, I have yet to have a meal I haven't been happy with. They have plenty of selections for all Italian lovers so don't expect just the obvious options. \n\nI'd suggest this place as more of a dinner place, mainly because of the prices along with the portion sizes. If you lunch it here, it may be a long afternoon at work trying to stay awake. And with their wine selection, making this a date destination isn't a bad idea either.
0 ||| So my coworker was really promoting this place to me, and I felt like Chinese food so our decision was made.......Horrible mistake!\n\nNumber One: Disgusting bland food. Every single (limited selection) dish sucked! The orange chicken tasted like old microwaved from freezer over sauced cardboard. The onion rings were crap. The egg rolls, crap. The chow mein noodles which I thought were supposed to look brown, were these pale watery strans of crap. The rice, which was clearly not white rice, was bland. The desserts sucked as well. Also, the presentation of the food looked very sloppy. \n\nNumber Two: Horrible enviornment. Ugly pink walls with horrible dollar store decorations. The booth seats were WAAAAYYY to close to the tables which made for an uncomfortable sitting experience. The sneeze guards were dirty. Weird smell. And stupid layout, with a couple of booths too close to the employee personal area and some too close to the (again small) buffet line. \n\nNumber Three: After this review, I am calling the health services on this disgustng place. A couple of times I noticed an employee scratching their nose, and then continuing with their work. Then I was forcing down my food when my coworker spots a moving insect on the wall next to us. It was a BABY COCKROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screw this place. I will never ever go back here. And if this place isnt shut down, I hope nobody else does either. \n\nOn the plus side, its only $6.00. But still not worth it. If I could, I would give this place negetive 1000000000000000000000 stars.
4 ||| I've now been to this restaurant twice - both during short, quick visits to Las Vegas. The first time, we stopped at here because my parents practically demanded that I give it a try! We stopped in on our way out of town for both visits, and it really was some of the best food and service for both, too.\n\nThe first time I ate here, I ordered corned beef hash, which came with eggs and potatoes if I remember correctly, and I got one of their sweet baked breads instead of toast. DELICIOUS! I also ordered a side of pancakes and split them with one of the people I was with - actually, come to think of it, I remember giving him a decent sized portion of all of my food. They don't skimp on things, let me tell you!\n\nThe second time I ate at this delicious restaurant, I tried the Eggs Benedict Lobster - SO WONDERFUL! The hollandaise isn't too rich, which I really appreciated. I rarely every enjoy hollandaise, unless I've made it myself - theirs complimented the flavor of the lobster. The eggs were done perfectly, the potatoes were delicious, and there were actual chunks of lobster. I really enjoyed my breakfast.\n\nSpeaking specifically about the second visit, myself, my partner, and our best friend were traveling. We ate at NUMEROUS places during our 4-day stay in Vegas (even a restaurant that ended up having a film crew there from the travel channel WHILE we were dining there!), and I must say, the service here blew every other place out of the water. Before eating here, we were all talking amongst ourselves about how absolutely horrendous all of our customer service experiences had been at almost every single place we'd dined at. Say we ate at 8 places - only two of them were nice, and one of those two was better than nice (guess what - it was Omelet House).\n\nAlso, it should be noted that both times we stopped in, they were pretty busy - and yet we were sat pretty much immediately.\n\nIf we go to Las Vegas again, this place will be on our breakfast list, for sure.
0 ||| I've been coming here since 1999. I've never been seen by the same dentist twice. They always tear up the inside of my mouth when they take the x-rays. There is no privacy. They double book appts. Most recently I made an appt for a cleaning but when I got there they said it was just going to be x-rays and exam and that I would have to make another appt for the cleaning with another office visit fee and more time off work and more sitting around waiting. Then they said 3 of my fillings should be removed and replaced with crowns. I've never thought to get a 2nd opinion at the dentist until now.  I just kept going back after all these years because I knew that in 6 months there will be a whole new set of people and figured they might not be as bad. Until now. I'm switching.
4 ||| I went there this past weekend with a friend and enjoyed their Dim Sum! They had so much more variety then the one at the PHX cultural center! Their spare ribs and chowmein on the cart was AMAZING! We had so much left over and it was so cheap! The people were very friendly too!
0 ||| Airport is showing its age...maybe I am biased as ATL is my home airport, but Skyharbor leaves a lot to be desired.
3 ||| 5 star Margarita ( try Sangria Swirl) \n3 star average food\n5 star service at the Bar!!!! I asked for veggie sticks which was not on the menu vs chips and the bartender cut them up for me.  Great Happy Hour menu before 7 pm
3 ||| I enjoyed this little spot because I've never been to an Irish pub before. Unfortunately I was on my vegetarian diet so I could try any of their meat dishes. I ended up getting a salad which is well, just a salad. They had a good selection of beer tho. I love stouts so they had a couple to choose from for me. \n\nThe interior is kinda dimly lit except for the tables which each have their own lamps. It was a family friendly environment with booths and tables as well as bar seating. i believe they had Tv's at the bar and one tv located in the dining section.\n\nThere's not much more i can say about this place seeing that my experience wasn't outstanding but just good service. Maybe ill try it again in the future since i am eating meat again.
0 ||| This place is closed, and for good reason.
0 ||| As my husband has been re-doing landscaping and building our courtyard, we've been here several times and are 0 for 4. Today's example: we looked at several samples of stone and went inside to see how much a bag of one type was. The response was that they don't carry bags, only 5 ton minimums plus a $95 delivery charge. Then, we asked about smallish boulders, like those we saw near the stone samples. They replied, \"Yes, we have those, they are 10 cents a pound, but they are really heavy.\" So we asked about how much the small boulders (as in 2.5 feet or smaller) weighed or about how much they cost....and they had no idea. In fact it was almost like they didn't want us to buy anything. weird. It would have not been so bad, except this was our 4th trip there and they have nothing we needed or asked for, and didn't seem to be upset by that at all. We also went to another local place before resorting to Home Depot. sad :(
4 ||| Enjoyed dinner here last night.  Service was great, food spectacular, no room to improve my experience.  I ravaged the delmonico and my wife loved the cilantro chicken.  Martinis were also very good.  Shared my comments with manager Corey.
2 ||| Good food.......too expensive though......i'd rather pay less and take home less leftovers.\nAfter living 30 yrs in ny......fresh bread.....no...good fresh bread is absolutely\nA must in an italian restaurant.\nWorst cold bread ever!\nSorry buca......its the truth.....even the server admitted she hears this from customers.\nWant insane bread....check out BABBO !! Yum!!!\n\nPs....my girlfriends Buca ravioli were really good !!!
0 ||| Oh my God. The shuttle ride from the terminal to this Hertz was interminable. Incredible traffic on the access road, partially due to construction and partially due to the road being far too small for the amount of traffic it handles, meant it took us about 30 minutes to traverse the short distance to the Hertz facility. That gave me time to read the Yelp reviews and power walk myself to the rental counter ahead of my fellow shuttle riders, and thank goodness because the line was soon out-of-hand. Our rental car was one of the crappier ones I've rented recently, but it ran fine and got us where we were going. Drop off was better than pick up, but that's not saying much.\n\nI wouldn't rent from here again--there's just got to be a different rental facility at Charlotte that is easier to get in and out of.
3 ||| try their appetizer of steamed mussels and their excellent bread pudding (huge portion).  Their bread was mediocre. I couldn't remember what seafood pasta I ordered; it was satisfactory but not a surprise. \n\nThe manager is very nice while the cook has a funny attitude. We went there craving for bread pudding at 5p right after they opened. As the waitress submitted our order to the chef, he said, \"we don't serve desert at 5.\" Anyway, we got our sweet tooth satisfied along with some tea for an hr. \n\nI give 4 stars for the atmosphere and the menu selection.
0 ||| I called to see about making plans for  my sister  to get married in their drive-thru later this year.  The woman on the phone was as rude as it get's and would not directly answer my questions, she was like a robot and kept repeating herself.  What a jerk!
3 ||| Enjoyed our first visit for the most part. Food was good, but service was mediocre at best. Started pretty strong and then really tanked. Had to find a different server to help settle our bill.
3 ||| Beep!  10 pounds of chicken breasts at $1.79 a pound.  Beep!  Good generic diapers at $.18 a piece. Beep!  6 month supply of laundry detergent for $12.00.  Beep!  3 pound bag of organic coffee for $14.00.  Beep!\n\nOh, and you'll have a giant slice of pizza and a large soda for just a $1.88 as well?  No problem!\n\nThat's the typical sound of a checkout for me when I'm at Sams Club.  \n\nI'm the proud Dad of a single income middle class family.  Warehouse stores are a Godsend for making ends meet and getting quality products at a reasonable price.  While you may end up spending a lot of money leaving here, the value you get in buying in bulk can be very good.  \n\nYou do have to pay an annual membership fee, which for us is just $40.  After a few times shopping here the membership fee does pay for itself.  Do some homework, though, and find out if the products you buy most are a deal, as in some cases the prices are not much different than a grocery store.  You can tour the store without paying the membership fee.  Also, produce comes in bulk, so make sure you can use all of the bulk purchase before it goes bad otherwise it will be some serious wasted money.\n\nWhat I find handy is the countless prepared trays and mixes that can be purchased.  Got an office potluck you need to bring a dish for?  No problem!  Just heat and go, with plenty of food to feed a lot of people and at reasonable prices.\n\nI've been a member for nearly 6 years.  Each year I end up getting my money back and then some on my membership costs.  Sams Club is a great way to save money for your family.
4 ||| I don't have high expectations of EconoLodge. I just want a clean place to sleep. That's all. They allowed me a late checkout, and the room was nice, I had no problems with it.\n\nThe reason why I am giving this location such a high star rating is because they were especially nice. My travel buddy accidentally left her pillow with her treasured baby blanket inside of it in the room.\n\nWe only realised this as we were on the plane headed home. As soon as we landed, we called them, and they fedexed it to her in Michigan in perfect condition.\n\nIt was so hassle-free and kind-hearted, I was amazed. I wouldn't expect such nice customer service from an economy hotel.
4 ||| Bacon pancakes, cold bathroom, amazing...
4 ||| Flowers by Jodi did all of the flowers for my ceremony and reception and they were spectacular. She worked with me and was very open-minded when I changed my mind or added arrangements. All of the arrangements were beautiful and still are 3 days after the event. She was very professional and always available via e-mail when I had questions. I definitely recommend these amazing flowers and the exceptionally talented Jodi.
3 ||| Although I love Gallagher's and this is my neighborhood standby for a quick and easy frothy adult beverage with friends, I was first leaning toward giving only four stars -- mainly because the quality of the \"fresher\" elements of the food (i.e. lettuce, jalapenos, etc.) is not especially consistent. But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: \n\n*FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) \n\n*Build your own burger - not only can you pick your \"meat\" but you can pick your \"bun\" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. \n\n*Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) \n\n* Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had \"Reserved For...\" signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my \"#1 go to watch a game\" spot for all time. \n\nP.S. If your preference is \"fake cheese\" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)
3 ||| OK; here is my input.  I have been here maybe 4-6 times over the last 15 years.  Still an \"average\" place for sushi and Japanese food.  The prices are slightly on the high side, but not outrageous.  The entrees and combos (teishoku) are average.  But the reason why I keep coming back (yes I know, not that often) is because my wife is a shrimp tempura freak and she says that they have the best tempura in the Phoenix Metroplex.  I have to agree...there are no good Japanese restaurants that know how to make good shrimp tempura.  Every watch that chef on Iron Chef?  Masaro Marumoto (???).  He always tells you how to make good tempura.  Whenever we go out-of-town, we got to go to a good tempura place to satisfy my wife.
4 ||| This place is about as authentic as you can get to New Orleans. It doesn't try to live up to its atmosphere. I can't tell if the people who own the place used to live in New Orleans, but they do act as if they do. I really hate to say that I believe that the place is authentic, as that its decorated with a few beads, and a \"burbon street sign.\" However, the beer lights are authentic [had the new orleans feathers], and the LSU flags were dead on.  Given that it was authentic, the food and service is not fast. I'm not sure if its because the kitchen is slow or if they are meticulous. \n\nThe food is simple. The place was packed [at lunch on a Monday]. The food had a small kick to it. The prices do seem a little high, but the portions are large. If you get a poboy, there will be a lot on your plate, enough for more than one meal. Additionally, given a no/low carb diet, you can ask for the rice&beans to be without the rice. Awesome! This place is comparable to my diet, close to where I work and live, and is close to average for a decent plate of food. I'm sold!\n\nI had the catfish, and I liked it. I dinned with family members [who had never had Cajun food before] and they liked it as well.\n\nLastly: The TVs. Typically I abhor a television at a restaurant, but the sound was muted   and it didn't really take away from the atmosphere. People were happy to be here, liked the food, and were happy to be around each other.
0 ||| Few things make me sadder than making this review:\n\nI have been going to Buono's for over a decade now and it never failed to impress... \nWhen I was told there were new owners I was told the recipe's and cooks were all the same so I was optimistic (especially considering that it has been good since I was 16 years old and started going there *29 now*)\n\nI have given them 3 chances now and each time it has gotten ruder and the food has gotten worse with every visit. \n\nIf by any chance the owners/ coming managers read this page: Here are a few things that could have circumvented losing another loyal customer.\n\nSpecifically to the owner: \n\nIf a customer shows you that they are being over-charged do NOT make the excuse that the \"school kids\" are changing the prices on the outside chalk board... After that, if they point out that the same price is on the menu above the register in green ink... do NOT double down that the school kids changed that price too!!!\n\nTo anybody in charge of the food:\n\n1. The garlic knots were a welcome addition when they were first added to the menu and started out delicious but it is very clear that the dough for them is made far in advance and frozen which leaves them very stale and tasteless.\n\n2. If a pizza is black on the bottom it should not be served.\n\n\nAs much as I have been frustrated I do hope they turn it around but I do not expect to be back again. I will really miss Buono's but I ate there so often that I am sure to lose a few pounds in the process.
1 ||| im a carolina bbq fan.  and sorry..but this bbq is just no that good.  its fast food bbq.  why not do real bbq sonny?  i dont want mcribs from a carolina bbq place
4 ||| BF: \"I need a new car.\"\nMe: \"Ok, let's go to Carmax.\"\nBF: \"I just want to look though.\"\n\nCar buying is not the funnest thing. So with the hassle-free services they have here, it was definitely a pleasant buying experience. We had researched a car online prior to the visit and wanted to see a certain one. \n\nWe get there and Shannon approached us and offered her assistance. We looked around at other models, but the BF had is eye on the one we saw online. We test drove it, and he fell in love. Shannon pulled numbers and added in the trade in value for his old car. She showed us different financing options and the BF was happy with the result. We went off to go sign the paperwork and bam!! Done!! Our \"new\" car was outside waiting for us, washed and shiny. All in only 2 hours!!\n\nShannon was with us the whole way through. She was so friendly and personable. She explained everything so thoroughly and was very patient with my BF and all his questions. It was nice of her to sit with us with during the signing to answer any last minute questions we had. (Which was a good thing because the guy who made us sign stuff was socially awkward and quiet.) At the end, she gave us a hug and wished us well. Thank you for everything Shannon. You're awesome!
1 ||| I filled out a request online @ www.corporateofficecenters.com to get pricing on a virtual office/mailbox in this location.  I received an automated email response saying they would get back to me in a few days but after a week or so went by with zero followup from them I decided to to call this location directly to get the details.\n\nThe lady I talked to was nice and quoted me $125 per month and promised to email me more information.  I am not that experienced in this type of thing but I think $125/month is a lot for just wanting a business address/mailbox.\n\nI really dislike Corporate Office Centers.  All the poor reviews on Yelp are spot on.  My wife has an office at another one of their centers but I'm going to wait to write a review until she moves out.
3 ||| When we arrived, we already had a reservation, but it did not mention that seats were first come first serve. Honestly, what is the point of having a reservation then? \n\nSo the 10:30am departure didn't quite work out. The driver told us that we should sit with 3 kids in one seat, and that was just not happening. But Alison, one of the tour guides, helped us and offered us to wait until the noon departure and assured us there would be seats. \n\nWe sat immediately and the tour was quite lovely! For $21 per person (adult) I thought it was reasonable and very fun. The jokes were seriously corny, but it was still a good time. The views were great.
0 ||| Food poor quality and salty. Place is dirty. My second time here. Thought will be better this time. Not coming back anymore.
2 ||| Would have gave it a 3 star for a typical world burger chain restaurant, if it was not for the horrible service. We were walking down the main strip of Las Vegas Blvd. My friend Steve wanted to eat at Denny's, I said Hell no. Let go somewhere it's happening. Well we came up to Fat Burgers, right off the main drag. It was not to busy. I was not to hungry, but I ordered anyway. \n\nHere what I ordered, a large chocolate shake with whip cream on top, which it was really good. My sister ordered to Fry's, which it tasted like Burger King Fry's. It was not to bad. She also ordered the strawberry shake. She liked it. I drank the rest of it. My friend Steve ordered the chili, he said it was ok. \n\nNow to the service. We were #62, 63,64,65,66 and 67 were all waited on before we got our food. I sat and watch and stared at this guy making our shake. He took his sweet Ass time. I never in my life seen a human being take so long to make 2 simple shakes. Our waiter was horrid. I think litteredly  think he was stone. I had to ask him where is our food? He said\"ah i don't know\". We finally got our food 45 minutes later. Remember this is a popular burger joint, the burgers and food are prepped. They suppose to cook the burgers quickly. \n\nBAD BAD BAD SERVICE for a renowned burger joint, we should have gone to DENNY's, at least we would have got better service. Hope to God the CEO of FAT BURGERS reads this YELP!
3 ||| It's honestly the best boba we have here in LV. Though the service can definitely improve, their drinks are always consistent which I like. I love boba milk green tea and would recommend it to any newcomers to boba.
1 ||| I had a coupon so stopped by for lunch. It was still to expensive. I had a Turkey Club  and a double slice of Cheese Pizza. With coupon it was still almost $11 and my pizza was burnt to hell. I couldn't even eat the pizza because all of the burnt black spots just didn't look right. The turkey sub was just okay. I can get a bigger sub from Subway that tastes better. With the right coupon I do like certain things here but they aren't consistent as far as the taste and quality of the food. There is a drive thru or you can eat inside and get free bread sticks.
4 ||| We have been going to Mario's pizza for the last several years and it has always had consistently good food and some of the best pizza in Charlotte.  My wife is from NYC so it was a requirement that we find something relatively close to her home-town pizza, and Mario's fit the bill.  Over the past year or so, it seems that Mario's has slowly been changing the pizza to the point that now, I may rank it below one of the many chains.  I can't put a finger on any one specific thing, but it has gone way down hill.  The crust seems to now be thicker and less crispy, the cheese is lower quality (though they seem to be putting more on, which means worse taste and more grease), and the sauce is not quite as good as it used to be.  I hope this changes but until then, i will be looking for a new pizza joint.
3 ||| My review was written four years ago, so I thought it was time for an update.  Still solid four stars, bathrooms have been remodeled, many owner changes and currently service is a little slow, but if you know this going in and you are in a good mood you can certainly tolerate it.  We meet at 5p on the dot, order starters and a bottle of wine immediately, but if you don't know this, you might be sitting there a little while.  If you like spicy food be sure to specify because they will tone it down for you.  Especially if you are getting take away tell them HOT or they will write medium down.  Even with crazy service, I don't care, Woodlands remains one of my favorite restaurants in the Queen City.
3 ||| my wife put it succinctly. sometimes you don't really get to appreciate mexican food when all you ever eat is the standard TexMex places that we frequent. \nand then you eat at a place like Carolina's and your whole perspective changes. \n\ni had an online coupon for Carolina's and since we like to stay within our 1-2 mile home radius, it forced us to head outside our box. we invited a friend from out of town to meet us there and he texted me \"man travis, i don't know about this place. it looks shady\". i assured him that this place was well known and to just wait in the car until we got there and that as AZ is a gun loving place, i would come locked and loaded strapped with my military grade weaponry. \n\ni was surprised at how unappealing and simple this place was. but that's what works for it i guess. since we don't eat meat, our choices were limited, but what we did order was absolutely fantastic. \n\ni loved the tamales. they had a few prepared and we tore into ours. then the enchiladas with green sauce. we also ordered a dozen tortillas and ate 5 of them before making it home. i have 2 more coupons for this place and can't wait to go back. i'm sure they taste so good because of the cooking ingredients (being a vegetarian doesn't mean i have to sacrifice lard every now and then does it?). but for a special occasion, this place is worth our drive!
4 ||| I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for.
0 ||| Never going back again!\nHaven't had a planters wart in years, I noticed something underneath my toes and was unsure if it was a wart or callous, it was extremely painful so I assumed wart and decided to make an appointment with them. I have an HMO and my insurance is only covered in my home state, this place seemed to have the cheapest price for a visit for someone without insurance(150 or 200 dollars I believe) it beat a plane ticket back home to visit with my dermatologist.\nFollowed my GPS, and when I turned into the facility I thought my gps had given me incorrect directions. The place was in a shady looking area, places had bars on windows, they had a small parking lot and the sign for their business looked old and letters were falling off.\nI hesitantly walked inside to see a rude and unprofessional looking medical assistant on the phone, not even acknowledging my presence except to glance and look away while 2 other nurses or assistants sat in the room as well, not looking up to notice me either. And by unprofessional I mean 6 inch long blinged out nails and huge gold hoop earrings, that really isn't something I have ever seen in a healthcare setting in my entire life.\nWhen she finally got off the phone about 3 minutes later I was handed paperwork that  I had to fill out, when I finished, I handed it back to her, all I received for a reply back was, \"okay\". Not an, \"okay, thanks, the doctor should see you shortly\". \nSo... I sat there for a half hour in this tiny waiting room, questioning myself multiple times if I should leave, wondering if this place was even safe or legitimate. Is the doctor even a doctor, are the nurses even nurses? Right as I was about to leave a nurse called my name.\nWhen the doctor came into see me he seemed very cold ( no smile or handshake like I'm used to from doctors) like he really didn't care, just wanted to hurry up, deal with my problem as soon as possible and get me out the door. He didn't seem to know if I had a callous or wart either but he froze it anyway. Told me to come in about a month and see if it was gone or not. I'm sorry, I don't have 400 dollars to just throw at a doctors office to see if it went away or not. And also the wart did go away, so why would I spend 200 on an appointment just to have him look at it and say, \"yeah it's gone\".\nOverall, I felt like they were rude and unprofessional and maybe I was treated even more like crap because I was viewed as an uninsured patient that really didn't matter to them.
4 ||| I've been here a few times now. There's a good selection of scrubs, and always plenty of staff to help. The people are friendly, and the store is clean, if cluttered. They also sell shoes and some medical supplies stethoscopes, badge holders, etc. It's a good place to go if you need scrubs another medical supplies.
0 ||| Thought the food here was okay. Service was extremely slow and we figured that's because the person behind the counter slooooooowly makes one burrito at a time. \n\nIt was $20 for 2 pretty big burritos, a bottle of water and two sides of chips for me and my hubs. Reasonable amount for a simple dinner out. \n\nNow,... I've never, EVER gotten food poisoning from eating out before, but I most definitely got it from Chipotle friday night. My night was MISERABLE, so thanks for that! \n\nNote: I'm never returning. Don't even think about offering me a friggin' coupon,... but getting my money back would be fabulous.
4 ||| I have to say that although there was a slight fishy smell, it was the least of any Asian-ish market I have EVER been in.  Yes, it seemed a little dark.  Yes, there were a few potholes in the lot.  Yes, there were a few boxes in the aisles.  I'm pretty much over all of those things because WOW!  What a great selection!  Their spice aisles alone were mind-bogglingly extensive.  I went in hoping to find 3 things (tandoori spice, garam masala, and cracked wheat).  Not only did they have all 3 of these items, but it was almost hard for me to pick which spices to get, because they had so many CHOICES!\n\nI took awhile, and just perused most of the aisles.  Sometimes Asian markets feel a little bit like one of the old Asian pharmacies, where you have row upon row of little bottles, all hiding interesting (and some creepy) pastes, powders, and concoctions.  Even with the names on the packages, I wondered about many things, \"What is IN there?  What would you use THAT for??\"  Personally, I really like it.  It's very inspiring to me, to try something new, and presents a world of culinary possibility.  They even have practically an entire row devoted to pickled things.  (What is with the pickled shark???)\n\nThe prices seemed very good (got my 3 items for 6 bucks, and each is a good-sized package), although I did have to go hunt somebody down to pay (-1 star).\n\nAll in all, I am really excited to find this little gem, and plan to return soon.
2 ||| We went with someone who was a regular here and they pre-ordered a lobster for us.  We had a 7 pm reservation and arrived at 7:10 pm.  We sat down and the lobster came out right away.  Yay!  Unfortunately, it was cold and apparently was cooked earlier in anticipation of our 7 pm arrival.  Boo!  Who cooks a lobster before the guests arrive?  What if they don't show?  Then the owner blames us for being late!  And then we found a few pieces of pork in the lobster.  What?\n\nThe rest of the food was ok.  The braised duck was delicious but small portion.  The ma po tofu was good.  Stir-fried bok choy hearts were good.  The stir-fried beef was over tenderized and boring.  We ordered braised fish that came out steamed.  Again some pointless explanations and the fish was replaced with the proper braised fish.\n\nOh well, a wasted night out out for dinner except for my fortune cookie.  \"You will inherit some money or a piece of land.\"  Good for me, bad for someone else.
4 ||| I can't understand all the negative reviews for Macayos in Goodyear. YES, for those that don't already know this, Macayos is a chain. It's a family owned chain and as far as I know, they're only here in Arizona, centered around the Phoenix area. They've been in business many years.\n\nMy family loves Macayos, and we've been to several. I just ate at the one in Goodyear today for lunch - I had a colleague in from out of town and he was up for some Mexican food, and he said he enjoyed it. We both had the Chimi Macayos, with shredded beef, rice and beans (lunch comes with one or the other but you can add the other for a buck or two). \n\nTheir chips are good, the salsa is good (not great, I admit, but good) and they serve portions large enough to satisfy any hunger. Seriously, if you eat here and leave hungry, you're one in a thousand.\n\nThey have a nice bar area, and on Friday and Saturday nights it gets pretty busy. The dining room is good sized and they can accommodate large groups. Which is good, because we often go there with a dozen or more family members.\n\nThey also have a very good line of margaritas, by the way.
4 ||| It's a good 10 miles or so from the Vegas Strip.  But this location of this chain crab and seafood restaurant is so totally Las Vegas.  It screams \"tourists, come inside!\". You've got the tacky weathered all wood pseudo shack with \"Joes Crabshack\" sign outside.  Inside, there are Christmas lights all year, the big goofy 12' long fake fish hanging from the ceiling, men's bathroom with \"Dudes\" on it, and a special on 60 oz. pitchers of beer. And as a special treat, the kids had the best balloon guy ever.  For one kid, he did a Darth Vader all black \"hat\" with a black sword.  For a little girl, he created an orange fish with blue bubbles.  And for her sister, created a six petaled flower with green steams.  \n\nWe were seated in about 5 minutes at 7 PM on a Friday night.  I really had low expectations of this place since I didn't enjoy my surf and turf meal at their Denver Colorado location a few years back.  Although I love crab, I hate to get my hands and shirt all dirty at a restaurant.  I will get sloppy at home where I can take a shower immediately after, but not here.  Pots of crab and seafood were the most popular item here.  A lot of the items are fried, like fish and chips, fried crawfish, fried shrimp. \n\nMy brother had the lump crab cake dinner with two crab cakes, a small bowl of coleslaw, and french fries ($13).   The two crab cakes were moist and naturally sweet with the true subtle crab flavor coming through, with just a slight douse of onion and garlic.  The fries were tender and crisp, and not too greasy.  The cole slaw had bits of red and green cabbage, and carrots in a slighlty tangy and very sweet mayo dressing. I would give that meal a 4.5 rating.  I had the half and half crawfish combo ($12) with one half crawfish etouffee with bits of crawfish in a warm creamy sauce.  The other half was deep fried crawfish tails. It was served with rice and cocktail sauce. Both are actually good and not overcooked.  I only at 1/3 of it because of my New Year's resolution to reduce my intake of fried foods. Myh meal was perhaps 3.5 stars. Our meals were enhanced by the beers on tap. My brother had Sam Adams regular lager, I had the Blue Moon.\n\nService was attentive enough. Music playing in the background was classic rock and pop from the 70s to the 90s.  The place is loud and energetic, with little kids and adults loving the tacky atmosphere, comedic balloon guy, and the food.  It was a pretty good experience here. \n\n.
2 ||| It's IHOP.  it serves a purpose.  I was making a late night run to Walmart and decided to eat here on my way out.\n\nFood was typical IHOP food and the service was spot-on.  The thing is that the typical IHOP food isn't enough to warrant more than 3 stars.
3 ||| We met some of my wifes co-workers after work here. I just kept dishing out Ramen jokes all day since I wasnt too much of a fan on this is where we would be going.\n\nAfter getting there my attitude quickly changed. They have a very wide assortment of dishes rather than noodles. Everyone but me got the yaki soba noodles with chicken. I tried something else, but dont remember what it was called. It was basically shrimp tempura in rice with some kind of sweet honey type of sauce over it. It was pretty tasty. I also got a rainbow sushi roll that took a very long time for them to prepare. It came after we were all done eating. It was good, and the price for it was decent. The only complaint I had was that the fish was sliced to thick. It was a little on the chewy side.\n\nOur waitress was kind of hit and miss, but she was a delight when she showed up. I would visit it again and definately skip the ramen jokes the next time!
0 ||| Like a previous writer said, used to be much better under previous ownership.  I'm a regular here (4 times a month on average) and i've noticed the service and quality isn't what it used to be.  I usually order the hot & spicy chicken.  The order i had last night wasn't good and their was nothing spicy about it.  To make matters worse, I always order and pay online through Eat 24.  Last night I went to pick up my order and was charged again for my food.  When I explained I already paid online, the guy insisted I had not.  Their was a language barrier so I did not want to argue with the guy so I paid for the food again.  Then had to go home and spend 20 minutes on the phone with eat 24 to get my charges reversed.  Looks like i will be looking for a new place in Henderson for Thai food.  Too bad cause I really liked this place.
3 ||| I went here with some friends last weekend to use a Groupon (4 people, shoe rental and 1 hour unlimited for 15$ woohoo!). I thought it was nicer than some other bowling alleys in Phoenix. The shoes were fairly new, which is always pleasant, the balls were organized by weight in a clear fashion, which was also nice. The only problem was the game froze a couple of times and the time kept ticking away, so we lost out on some time BUT at the end of our hour (of speed bowling) we only had a few frames left on our last game and the guys there gave us an extra 10 minutes for free to finish up, so that was very nice. I would come back here.
0 ||| Although there were open seats, the waiteress took forever to seat us. The table we sat at was not clean and the service was terrible
2 ||| GREAT coffee, horrendously slow service with other employees not interested in helping knock down the line. If you are just getting coffee, hit the drive-thru - you'll be less frustrated.
0 ||| This is by far one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. The hostess had an attitude, while all of the staff had the same horrid attitude like we are bothering them by eating at the restaurant. You have to pretty much beg for another glass of water or tea, but when you get their attention to all for another glass of water, it still takes a long time to get it. The only time they were fast was when you gave them them check and money to pay. \nThe food was okay, but I'm pretty sure I can find better food and service some where else.
4 ||| adorable.
3 ||| This place has the cutest and quirkest little items for sale, a great place to shop for a gift for a mom, sister, or friend! I always love the selection of cards they have too.\n\nOn top of that, their bakery case is AMAZING. I'm not a huge fan of their cookies (I like mine to be more moist and chewy, theirs tend to be drier and crumblier), but I like their tres leches cake and the old-timer cupcake (the one that looks like a big Hostess cupcake). Their gelato is really good too and made in-house with no preservatives or anything weird like that. My favorite flavor is the peach, although the mint is also interesting. Just be forewarned that it's REALLY minty, like really really really minty with actual chunks of mint leaves in it. might be good to eat on a date so you can have super fresh breath for that goodnight smooch! haha!\n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the parking situation is ridiculous. I know they have a valet who will park your car for you and they validate the valet ticket so you don't have to pay the $3, but it's still an inconvenience! last time I came I had to wait almost 15 min in a long line of cars, boo.
0 ||| This place is lame!!! We came on a Sunday night and all we wanted after a chilly walk was a tea. BUT, when we ordered the lady told us we couldn't buy just one tea \"five dollar minimum per person!\" Needless to say we walked out. Freaking dumbest thing I've ever heard!!!!
1 ||| I stayed here years ago and had a good experience so when I saw a Groupon for it, I jumped on it, but I was quite dissapointed with our second stay here.\n\n1) Vouchers (gaming chips, breakfast buffet to be included with the groupon deal) were not provided upon check in. Time was wasted standing in line later that night to obtain them after being told by a friend that they were provided upon check in. \n2) The employee that checked us in told me that internet was included in the fare and to select the $5.99 option when accessing the internet, but it would not be charged. However, when I tried to utilize the express check out, I found I was chrged $5.99 for each day we stayed T the hotel! I was charged $5.99 three times! More time was wasted standing in line so that I could sort it all out. No apology was given. \n3) The tub was awful and did not drain properly. Each time I showered, it filled the tub half way!\n\nAn absolute dissapointment. \n\nThe breakfast was ok, but too greasy for me. I would have prefered more healthy options for sure.
0 ||| Can I give a \"0\" star? \n\nWorse impossible: 1/2/15. Flight # 0477. My trip starts with a 14 h delay (yes 14 hours)  from Barcelona, Spain to JFK. NOT for weather reasons but for \"technical\" issues. After the 14 h delay + 10 h flight I request to be invited to the JFK Sky lounge as compensation for the damages and exhaustion. The answer is $50. Completely obnoxious service. After obviously missing my connection I get re-booked on a flight  with a 6 h layover at JFK (!). Which again got delayed 3 h because of a \"broken pump\". Finally get in the plane and arrive to Phoenix (2 days after!) and my checked luggage is not there. \n\nDelta Airlines planes are old and falling apart, out of 4 planes I took with them this Christmas, 2 had technical problems. Their customer service is down the drain and when you board and watch their welcome video you have to hear from their CEO that their number 1 priority is our safety and \"comfort\". Haha Don't make me laugh blood suckers. \n\nThis is a rolling down the hill airline, which most likely will not be around in 5 years. \n\nOne of the very few times I've flown Delta and certainly the last. \n\nI have already contacted a law firm to start the economic compensation process for the delay on both flights. \n\nNo mercy with this obnoxious people.
4 ||| When a coworker heard I was going to Madison, he told me that I HAD to go to Himal Chuli. I made him write it down because I had no idea what he was saying. He said he ate there at least 5 times a week; he must not have known how to cook. Went there for lunch around 2:30 with my boyfriend after a failed attempt to go see a screening of My Neighbor Totoro put on by the Cinematheque, and there were tons of open tables. The space is so tiny; I can't imagine it during a lunch rush.\n\nOur Warby-Parker bespectacled waiter materialized almost instantly with waters after telling us we could sit anywhere. The water tasted kind of fruity, and I didn't figure out until later, when they were refilled, that it had been infused with lemon and cilantro. We looked over the menu and decided to share an order of chicken momocha, and the roti/tarkari combo. The momochas were reminiscent of the dumplings my mom makes, but with hot salsa to dip it in. Our entree came with a bowl of dal, which is a mixed bean soup that is so simple, but just the best. The humble bean was transformed into a transcendental soup. The saag tarkari was comparable to the Indian saag, but without the dairy component. \n\nOverall, the meal was simple yet hearty. I was reminded of how humbly the other half lives, and how hunger is the best sauce.
1 ||| I came here a few days ago on a weeknight with 7 other people. We started out with the appetizer tower which came with crab cakes, calamari and mussels. The crab cakes and calamari were great but the mussels didn't seem to be cooked enough. We also tried some sushi, which was quite good.\n\nOnce our dinner came, everything went downhill. Our waiter disappeared for a good 20 minutes, no one came around to switch out our appetizer silverware for dinner ware, we ordered a second bottle of wine which arrived promptly but they did not change our wine glasses until we asked and had to pour the wine ourselves.\n\nI ordered the Chilean sea bass and was not at all impressed. It seemed too overcooked and doused in the sauce it came with. Halfway through my meal, I had had enough and didn't even want to smell the fish anymore because it was making me sick to my stomach.\n\nOverall, wasn't impressed by the food and our server (James T.) didn't seem to care about us since he was guaranteed a tip anyway. For a place that seems so classy, the experience surely was not. Didn't feel respected as a customer.
2 ||| I have to be completely fair and say that, I would have given them 5 stars had, the manager not try to give me a quote that was utterly ridiculous. I went in for just a simple brake job, including ONLY new pads! Somehow my drums needed to be replaced and a whole heap of other stuff had to be done.  I was highly upset, but, Thanks to the Front Desk Guy, I was helped and he saved me a ton of cash by showing me the deals and urging me to stick to my budget and the purpose of my visit.
1 ||| My husband and I have been frequenting Wild Thaiger for a few years. We have done both dine in and take out. Usually with a great experience. However in the last few months the service has deteriorated. Long wait times for a server to pay any attention to you making every meal feel long and drawn out. On our most recent visit this evening it took forever to be acknowledged when we walked in. After we were sat it took another 10 minutes before our server came over. Other than the slow service the food runner/ bus girl with a bad attitude had her pants riding so low that at first we could see her butt crack, later she was flaunting her thong. I'm pretty sure if I wanted a strip tease I would have gone to bandaids down the street, not wild Thaiger.
0 ||| Rude. Unprofessional staff. Ruins the experience every time. And the food isn't that great to be a repeat customer.
4 ||| I've been in town for 32 years now and first was recommended to Ted Wiens in the early 1980's when they were downtown. At that time, they offered to 'knerl' the front spindles on my 1950 Chevy Pick-up to save me replacing them. It is that type of \"save the customer money\" that is still alive and well at this location at Decatur and Rancho. When you go, ask for Randy. He is the type of honest, hardworking mechanic that you just don't find everywhere. I've followed Randy thru a couple shops in our area in the last 10 years and now he is at Ted Wiens, Decatur and Rancho. I hope he stays here ! !  But if he doesn't...I'll track him down again. He is that good ! !
4 ||| Luv's is the place for late night, sugar-fest cravings - where calorie count is never to be questioned. The standard custard that comes in the short list of specialty concoctions is smooth, creamy or overly sweet. \n\nTried the Western and a bit of the Scotch Jimmie. Usually not a butterscotch fan, but I liked it's slightly buttery toffee flavor. \n\nOpen late into the night, And it doesn't look like a place that closes. \n\nDRAWBACKS\nIt's located on LVB, but the sketchy local side. The other customers are varied, but many look like the wandered out of or just finished their shift at OG - a close by strip club. * and no seating. With the common clientele, a reason is not hard to imagine. \n\n** Please go - even if you get accosted , you'll have a good Vegas experience and a helluva desert.
0 ||| Very POOR service. One person in the party got grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't even melted. Waitress seemed out of it and didn't care AT ALL. Ordered a medium well cowboy burger. It was RAW!! Wasn't the first time food has gone back here and the fact that 2 out 3 orders in one sitting went back was ridiculous. It wasn't even a crowded night.
0 ||| The customer service including that of the manager Jeff at this Home Depot is the worst I've every received.  I was contacted to pick up a door that I had ordered.  After waiting for an hour, the staff including the manager running the store finally figured out that the someone had set the door up front in customer service (where the rep who called me said it would be) dahhh.  When I commented on how ignorant everyone was the manager started threatening me and I thought I was going to have to call the police.  I have written a letter to corporate about this store and manager.  If you must shop at Home Depot make sure it isn't this one unless you are experienced in Martial Arts.  It truly is the ghetto and the staff reflect it.
0 ||| Horrible. We used to go here all the time but now there are new owners and this place has gone down hill. The rolls fell apart and the fish was sliced thin. We had ayce and the waitress let the plates keep piling up on the table. Never going back, so many better choices in town
0 ||| Quick Synopsis:\n\nArrived on a Sunday, waiting three hours in the outside waiting room, waited another hour in dr. waiting room, seen by doctor 15-20 minutes  tops.  Received a one thousand dollar charge for an ear infection! Who could afford this place without insurance. Called to discuss bill never received a return call from billing department. \nI have taken my children there many of times, but never once had this experience and really considering taking my \"urgent care\" business elsewhere.
2 ||| Salsa club moved next door, but restaurant closed on 08/15/2009.  I always wanted to try this place, I'm sad to see it go....
0 ||| Very rude sales person on the floor very rudely told my three year old child that riding the child's bike that was on display was not allowed and physically stopped her from doing so while myself and my husband were standing right there. She did not offer any assistance and rolled her eyes when I displayed my disapproval of her talking down to my child. Will not be returning to this location and possibly REI entirely.
2 ||| Maybe I should have tried the pizza and not a sandwich.....\n\nI usually don't write reviews after one visit but this was so bad, I can't wait.  I looked at their menu online and did see that they offer a cheese sub - awesome (or so I thought).  I go in and order the veggie and cheese sub and watch the gal behind the counter write \"turkey and cheese sub, hold the turkey\", I'm thinking ok maybe that's how they do it here.  \n\n I unwrap the sandwich when I get home and it looks like it had been run over by a car on the way to my table.  The bread was disgusting - a rubbery and chewy slab of thick white bread that they have the nerve to call a hoagie roll.  The contents were a little lettuce, a little onion, a couple of thin tomato slices and one layer of cheese - processed cheese.  When I think back to how the order was written up I wonder if I did literally get the shell of another sandwich.  I moved the scant one layer of cheese from one side to the other, ate that half and chucked the rest.\n\nThe fact that this sorry excuse for a sandwich came to just under $8 is really just a footnote in comparison to how lousy it was in each and every way.\n\nI probably will go back and try the pizza and will be honest and objective when I do, however, I absolutely would never get a sandwich here ever again.
4 ||| A unique little spot with a quirky menu.\n\n I usually frequent this place with friends or with my lifelong dining partner due to the fact that it's close to my workplace as well as my abode. I really go here just for the atmosphere at night. When I'm feeling lively, I'll choose to sit inside and let the thumping of the music and cacophony of voices take over as I indulge in my meal. However, during those off days where I just want a place for (somewhat) quiet contemplation, I'll decide on the outside patio. If the weather doesn't permit and I still want that solace, they also have a lounge with a fireplace directly above the bar. It really does have a place for any sort of mood.\n\nThe food is decent. Their menus do change quite frequently though, so it's best not to get *too* attached to a certain dish. One aspect that I love is how they name and describe their food. There's so much thought and effort put into each item as they come up with the most interesting of names and elaborate stories to introduce them to their guests.\n\nTheir drinks are very good. They have a small little book dedicated to the cocktails and other alcoholic beverages they offer. It's always an adventure, choosing a drink as they offer a wide range of quirky mixes and cocktails. My personal favorite would be the Happy Ending, which is a cucumber-mint based cocktail that entails the magic of vodka and a few other liquors. It's perfect for refreshing the palate between dishes. \n\nSadly, Harris Grill is a bit on the pricey side and the service is a tad inconsistent. But their unique menus and overall atmosphere is what keeps me coming back. \n\nPS. Tuesday is bacon night aka free bacon!
3 ||| Great place to get soul food in the city. You will have to wait for a table on weekends. The wait staff is personable, but seem to be spread thin tending to the crowds of patrons that frequent the restaurant. They aren't the cleanest restaurant, the bathrooms are gross.
3 ||| I'm a huge fan of their Wednesday prices and really enjoy the selection of good quality produce at farmer's market prices.  It's always a bit crowded and the parking lot is a disaster, which is why the 4 stars. Overall, people are super nice and friendly and the food is high quality/organic for really reasonable prices.
3 ||| I have driven through this location many times never realizing this place was there. A co-worker had spoken highly of the Scottsdale location so I decided to try this one in the Downtown Phoenix area as it is just a few miles down the street where I live.\n\nI ordered the Toy-Toy which is 1 waffle and 2 chicken wings. I added a side of scrambled eggs. The order took a while to come out. The eggs arrived cold. The waffles and chicken were good. \n\nWhat I noticed is that when we arrived there were not many people, but just a few minutes after we arrived about 5 new parties arrived. So my assumption for the delay in our order was that they must have delayed frying the chicken for our order to get all the orders in from the other parties, because everyone else's food arrived almost at the same time as ours. So we got to wait.\n\nI would definitely go back but solely for chicken and waffles.
4 ||| This place was really good. Randomly went here with some friends and I'll definitely be returning.\n\nI had a 3 piece combo (catfish & whiting) with shrimp, fries and hush puppies. The whiting is really good, better than the catfish. Shrimp was good, glad the pieces weren't small. I liked the fries, soft vs. crunchy. I didn't make it to the hush puppies, that was the only thing that didn't look appetizing. I did try some fried okra, that was really good too.\n\nThe fried fish and seafood are really good. This place is relatively cheap. For $10 I don't know if there is a better option in Arizona. Definitely the best fried seafood I've had in Arizona.\n\nThis place is not in the best location, it's behind the light rail but it's worth finding.
0 ||| I am not sure who is ready to give 5 stars to this place. I spend about 5 hours at this UMC \"quick care\" and left with a medication that I was on and did not work on me for the same condition. I have a big bill coming in every week and I dont know for what.  This place looks like a scam. I woul;d rather prefer going to CVS ot walgreen clinic.\n\nThanks
0 ||| Let's see. My appt was at 8am,I was called back at 8:56am, and didn't see a doctor till 9:10a A 60$ copay for the visit and a prescription the same price.. I'm kinda a big deal and my time is valuable. Thanks for wasting it.
0 ||| Called and specifically asked if they could guarantee delivery between specific times on Valentines Day, once assured I placed my order.  15hrs later I get a voicemail asking if I could move the delivery to today and if so they would throw in a box of chocolates free of charge.  After being put on hold for a total of 30min and hung up on twice they finally found my order and assured me that everything would be delivered today.  Well the flowers were delivered today but no chocolates along with misspelled  and misquoted words on the card.  When you charge $15 for delivery I'd expect some level of professionalism. I will NEVER order from here again.  STAY AWAY and order from 1-800-FLOWERS.  I had wanted to support a local business but in this instance I will stick with a national competitor.
2 ||| Decent Indian food. Not incredible, but not bad, either.\n\nI usually go for the lunch buffet ($8.95/person) since shelling out $50+ for a decent dinner for two doesn't give me the food for value I can get elsewhere in town.  As someone else mentioned, they have a late-night 1/2 off deal, but unless you want to eat dinner around midnight, it doesn't make too much sense.\n\nNothing stands out in my mind as a \"must have\" or \"to die for\".... But, on the flip side, nothing is a \"must miss\", either.
3 ||| I'm still not sure I \"get\" the whole Chicken and Waffle  as a food combination, but I guess the question is: do I really need to? \n\nI've read that you may have to wait in line. Luckily that has not been the case for us as we've gone on off-peak hours: Wednesday night for dinner around 6pm and a Friday afternoon late lunch (1pm) . \n\nService has always been pleasant and the meals have come out on a timely basis.  And, hands down, Lo Lo's makes the best waffle...ever.  I think what makes it special is the  touch of Cinnamon. \n\nI ordered the Betty Boop (a chicken breast and a waffle) - definately enough to fill you up.   My husband orders a couple of drum sticks, waffle, fried okra and corn bread.  He can't help himself, his family is from the south and he likes to re-live his youth.  Too bad his metabolism has moved on....
3 ||| I was disappointed in my experience at Fado Irish Pub.  My friends have really enjoyed Fado for lunch in the past and so I thought I would give it a try for St. Paddy's.  Probably a mistake going to a very busy Irish pub on St. Patrick's Day but I thought it would be fun to check out the live music under the tent and reasonably priced Killian's Irish Red.  It wasn't the immense crowd that make me unhappy, but the fact that on a day when Fado knows they are going to be turning a huge profit, they still charged a $15 cover charge just to get in and wait in line for 20 minutes for a cup of beer.  In principle I usually refuse to pay a cover charge but my friends and I had already made plans to meet another friend there and so we felt obligated to stay.  Plus, the doorman said that I would be receiving a $10 gift card for entering, really only making my cover charge $5.  Too bad he didn't mention that you had to spend $20 on items other than alcohol in order to get the $10 discount.  That's not called a gift certificate, that is a coupon.  By the time my other friend arrived only 30 minutes after I did, the line was so long (around the block!) that she would have to wait at least an hour to enter, so all of us ended up leaving and going to another restaurant/bar.  $15 per head cover when you already know you are going to turn a huge profit is just greedy.  On a positive note, there was no line for the ladies room inside of the bar due to the crowd control at the door. Perhaps contributing to my negative attitude is the fact that I am possibly just getting too old for this kind of experience, with the meat-market atmosphere and drunk idiots everywhere.  If you are young and looking to hook up, this might be just the place!  Next St. Patrick's I will probably go somewhere more low-key where there is no cover charge.
2 ||| Pho pho pho. OPEN 24 HOURS! Yay.\n\nIt tastes just okay. Nothing amazing or to tell others about. I was sad that they didn't have the shrimp-paste and comtam type dish here; I was seriously craving it more than Pho.\n\nHowever, you can't be picky about cheap(in an Vegas sense) pho. One day I'll find a better place. Oh, beware of terrible drivers that park horribly.
0 ||| ewww.  didn't like this place.  the neighborhood was iffy and i was scared to leave the hotel after dark.  the room was dated but clean.  won't be back.
4 ||| We decided to go to Mimi's because my husband had never eaten there and it had an eclectic menu- everything from quiche and crab cakes to ribs and burgers. We had the zucchini spears with parmesan as an appetizer- it was flash fried, so not greasy, and the veggies kept their texture. \n\nHubby was well pleased with his strawberry lemonade (it was quite tart and yummy) and with his French Dip with cheese, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. It was not as rare as we are used to from Houston's French Dip (the planet's best, we are convinced), but still moist and quite generously portioned. \n\nI made the horrible mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak. I'm not sure what that was on my plate, but it was rubbery and tasted vaguely of fish. The sauce was tasteless and had a nasty been-sittin'-around- too-long film. The waitress came by quickly to check on us and took away the badness (I was very nice about it to her face, of course) and brought me the BLT I should have ordered in the first place. It was delicious and had I don't know how many rashers of bacon goodness on it. \n\nAll in all, the service was excellent and everything we had except the chicken fried steak was good. They corrected the problem very quickly and with a great attitude.
3 ||| First off, this is an entertaining place. They cook in front of you and sometimes throw you food to see if you can catch it in your mouth (lol). It's fun.\n\nI haven't tried the sushi rolls, so I can't judge those.\n\nHowever, I have tried to Filet mignon dish + fried rice. The filet mignon is good, but the fried rice is okay. It's not bad, but its not wonderful either. The price is a little high, but filet mignon is usually expensive anyway.\n\nI guess I would recommend this place. I will come back one day to try the sushi rolls.
4 ||| Consistent and inexpensive Neds is a great place to go for lunch. The lunch special runs from 10-4 so there is plenty of time to pick up a cheap sub.
4 ||| We had a fun relaxing time my friend had the caesar salad it was fantastic my bf had  ham X it was good and I had the sweet n spice asian salad it was out of this world and our waitress was awesome
4 ||| I am sitting here now, at La Grande Orange, enjoying myself. Reminiscing, looking at my blog and being in love with their Quinoa/Kale salad which is divinity. \n\nThe music was very loud when I came in an hour ago. This I loved, but the ancients  started complaining so they turned it down..   Ive come to expect this in Phoenix. \n\nWhen will oldies just die already? Just kidding.
0 ||| I rent from Hertz every week and have been a Presidential Circle member for several years.  I have probably rented from over a 100 different Hertz locations.  This one is by-far the WORST.....EVER! \n\nThe shuttle is super slow and with one shuttle running, the wait feels like an eternity.  The shuttle driver just sits there and does not help in anyway.\n\nEven with a Gold Reservation booked far in advance, don't be surprised if your name is not on the Gold Board.  When I was there, there were at least 20 Gold Members whose car was either not in the stall in the indicated stall or their name was not list on the board.  The lady working the Gold Counter was SUPER RUDE and acted if she was being bothered if anyone tried to ask her questions.  She was basically a service agent at the Gold Counter who did not want to be bothered.  \n\nI had an issue with my driver license.  So the SUPER RUDE gold counter lady called over the supervisor.  I had lost my driver license so he tried to explain to me why he could not rent me a car.  He thought he could, so he called someone else to clear it.  I asked if I can speak with the person he spoke to on the phone and i was told \"NO\" since he if off the clock.  He tells me that he can call him but a customer cannot since he is off the clock.  While this is going on, the SUPER RUDE gold counter lady starts blurting out State Laws which she claims prevents Hertz from renting me a car; most of her \"facts\" were total fairy tales.\n\nI will never rent form this Hertz again.  If I am back in Charlotte for any reason, I will forgo my Gold Hertz status and rent from either Avis or National.  Actually, if Avis or National offers me instant status (Gold equivalent), I would jump ship immediately.
4 ||| Picked up a small trailer for a one week rental...took a little while b/c they were busy (a good sign in my book), and the service was very friendly. No issues dropping it off, and they were gracious when I was a little past their normal rental time. I'll def use them again
4 ||| The pizza is always great here and the servers are quick. Great bar with even better food!
3 ||| I have been all over the world at every type of sushi restaurant imaginable. Yes, the sushi here is good and surprisingly fresh considering we are here in the desert and not the port of Long Beach. But the sushi business has become very competitive around Henderson and you had better be fresh or you will out of business quickly. I have seen many local sushi restaurants have the sushi come right from the airport via courier to get the freshest fish for the day. I do not know if I love sushi gets their fish this way but each time I have been there it has been fresh.\n\nI have had bad experiences with the staff and management. One time a waitress spilled liquid on my wife's new dress. You would think there would be a voluntary adjustment on the check but I had to argue with the manager to get a few bucks off the bill for dry cleaning IF the dress could be cleaned at all. Another time the fire alarm was going off the entire time we were eating. I understand it is not the fault of the staff but an apology and perhaps a free appetizer would have been nice when the experience literally resulted in a headache.
3 ||| Decent little taco stand sort of restaurant. The burrito that I had was good, nothing to shout about, but a solid breakfast burrito. The nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good.\n\nMine came out pretty quick, but my friend's burrito was quite long in arriving. They have some good combination burritos that aren't significantly more expensive like the ones you might try to get at other places. I would visit again to get a second opinion of the place.
3 ||| i've been seeing dr. goldman for more than 10 yrs..  very happy with him and his staff.  about a yr or so ago, i stopped going to him.  he charged an administrative fee of yearly $35 or something ridiculous for seeing him for paperwork, etc. processing.  Really?  even couldn't be grandfathered in after i complained for being a long standing patient.  he moved from 40th & bell to camelback and i continued to see him.  i didn't ask him for more gas??!!!  i continued to make the much longer trip & nvr complained.  this took the cake.  a drs. office charging an adm fee?  argh! i have since gotten a very nice doctor around the corner i'm happy with but decided since apparently i'm still good enough for their email list and had a yelp link, i'd give my 2 cents worth!!
4 ||| Best Mexican food in Las Vegas! Super authentic just like my grandmas and aunts cooking. Chile rellenos are amazing! I highly recommend their pineapple drink. Very tasty and my favorite drink We go almost every weekend. The kids love it too! Highly recommended! Friendly staff!
4 ||| I honestly didn't expect much when I decided to get married in a chapel in Las Vegas, but this place is amazing! Family run business which is very professional. They have great packages and prices! I highly recommend using them. Everyone is very genuinely friendly and they pay extra attention to what you want. Luke helped me the most through phone calls and when we got to the chapel, they are all very sweet. You get a great deal for your money! Really glad we got married there! You only have to wait a few days for the photos after the ceremony and they send you home with a DVD too! Thank you so much for making our wedding so perfect!
4 ||| in town for some business and looked at what was available right near the hotel...nice selection...clean
0 ||| Hideous.  Corporate. Horror.  Sound is appalling if  you're not square in front of stage. Beer is like $200. Would rather get punched repeatedly in the face than go to this dreadful shithole.
2 ||| I came to Steamers once before for a job, and I told myself if I ever needed to watch a game this is where I'm coming. This place is right around the corner from my house and well, lets say they have a lot of TV's. It's a sports pub, I didn't expect less. So I came here to watch the Knicks play because of an Asian American player Jeremy Lin play and I didn't receive the game at home.\n\nI ate the Philly Cheese Steak. The waiter came and asked me if I wanted tomatoes and lettuce, and I did however when they came back they didn't have tomatoes and lettuce and they brought it out on a plate instead. The tomatoes were fine, but the lettuce looked a little old. I drank a couple of beers and watched the game. The place had some pretty good 90's music and a good amount of country. \n\nMy roommate who went with me ordered a burger and said it was juicy and well cooked, so I can't really comment on what his thoughts were. (However, he does have the credentials because he's a student at Johnson and Wales and works in a kitchen) After we ate our entree, we ordered the nacho supreme. It wasn't bad. the lettuce still wasn't that fresh, but the portion size was okay. At 10 every weekend they have karaoke night.\n\nOverall, if I come back here, I would just order a beer watch the game (as they had so many TV's just ask what you want to watch and they'll get your own TV) and then go home. Maybe get some nachos as it's not expensive at all. I don't know what the first reviewer was talking about with the prices were expensive. I didn't think it was expensive at all, but actually not priced badly at all.
0 ||| This restaurant is the worst I've ever been. The hotel screed up my room and now this diner. Service is the worst and food is not far. The hotel deserve to be at the last hotel of the strip.
1 ||| So there were some very good things about this hotel, but all of the negatives outweigh the good and ultimately make this a hotel I wouldn't stay at again.\nFirst, a disclaimer- I am a Hilton Diamond VIP.  I spend a huge portion of my life in hotels, and Hilton is my chain.  So I get hooked up.  And so it's weird when I go to another chain and don't get any perks or a choice room.  However, I be that most people who are going to stay here AREN'T high on their loyalty program, so their experience may be a lot like mine.\nI stayed here for a business convention for 3 nights.  I was put on the 6th floor in the \"atrium.\"  Yes, atrium is hotel for \"noisy.\"  Because it was.  Very, very loud.  The whole floor is open to the meeting area below, and night time events are hosted here until well after 10 p.m.  One night I woke up at about 2 a.m. because drunk women were shouting and having too much fun.  Too loud to fall asleep/stay asleep?  Deal breaker.\nProblem #2- my shower drain was completely clogged and the tub filled up and random hair was floating in it.  Gross.  So here's the thing.  If housekeeping cleans the shower at all, they have to run water.  If they run water, they have GOT to see that the tub isn't draining.  So they should call maintenance to fix it.  So this means that either the housekeeping staff didn't bother to clean the shower OR they didn't bother to have the drain fixed, either of which is lazy and totally unacceptable.  I had to shower in the gross water-filled tub on day #1.  To their credit, it was fixed after I called, but the point is that I should never have had to call.\nThe wifi was extremely slow, to the point where I started turning the wifi off and connecting with the 3G. (It really was that bad.)\nThe bed was decently comfortable, but the sheets were worn to the point of having small holes and should have probably been replaced 30 washes prior.\nThe attention to detail just wasn't there.\nLast, the check in process is just bizarre.  They have self-serve kiosks, but someone from the front desk checks you in using the self-serve kiosk.  Why have them?  Checking into a hotel is actually one of the only times I prefer checking in with a human, so just eliminate the kiosks.  \nThe staff was exceptionally friendly, which was great, and the wait for the elevators was never too bad.  Valet is expensive, but they're generally pretty quick about bringing your car around.\nThe hotel is kind of in the middle of nowhere right downtown...however, there are a few places nearby to grab a quick lunch, and there's a Starbucks right across the street.  (Score!)\nSo although there were some great things about the Hyatt,  over all this is a hotel I wouldn't come back to.
2 ||| I'd have to say this place is mediocre at best. Sesame chicken, kung pao chicken, and egg fried rice... I give all 2 stars, mostly because they really didn't have much flavor. Honestly it was probably the worst sesame chicken I've ever had but it was edible with some doctoring up. It was also pretty over priced for the quality. The 3rd star is just because they deliver, that's always a plus.
0 ||| I had an experience with a very impersonal, rude, and pretentious associate. I had gone upstairs to research and see a lounge set in person on the upper floor above the floral department and I happened to be on a lunch break from wrk.  and was snacking while discussing the purchase of a lounge set and firepit. I was approached here abruptly and she made no conversation but too let me know that \"they do not do that up here\".  I am in sales myself and would never ever  speak  too a potential  buying client like this! and she really has skills to wrk on! even in all situations being the client is right/wrong! she has sales skills to improve if she is going to stay. I always thought of Restoration as a fun atmosphere and clearly it is not and is quite stuffy!
4 ||| We love the Marriott because they are usually in great locations and are clean. They belong to a nice corporation. \n\nWe only stayed at this Marriott for a night. Checked in around 11pm. The guest service was awesome as usual. The room a/c didn't feel cool enough but granted we came from Northern Virginia where heat wasn't turned on at night. But it's a perfect location. Within a couple blocks of restaurants and bars. We will definitely be staying here on weekend getaways again.
3 ||| We had a big meal...Thai eggrolls, level 3 chicken curry and pad see ew, level 0 orange chicken, chicken pad Thai levels 7 and 10.  Eggrolls were good but tiny, curry was spicy, pad see ew was delish, orange chicken was nearly rock hard, and pad Thai was good.  Level 10 was too much and my hubby will dial back next time.  A lucky Yelp find near our home.
0 ||| Horrible staff, Louie the manager was the only professional person. The bartenders decided to tip them self $120 and forge our signature or something (still not sure exactly what happened) but Louie the manager refunded our money and hopefully fired the staff that was responsible for this. Rediculous
0 ||| I walked in this morning. There are 2 employees standing at the counter. NEITHER looks up to even say hello to me. (Although, as what looked to be the morning shift was arriving over the course of the 15 minutes I was there, they said good morning to everyone who worked with them that walked through the door) \n\nThis place is a \"print center\" and they could not print on simple card stock that my regular home printer can print on. So lame. The card stock kept jamming so they wouldn't print anymore for me, even though it was printing them beautifully, they were just jamming when they were coming out so they had to keep opening the machine. \n\nAt any rate, 1 star because for being a print center they should be able to PRINT.
0 ||| Walked in last night honestly ready to sign up for a new family plan with 5 lines, I just needed to pick up one phone (we already own phones for the other lines) and sign on the line. I waited for about half an hour before I just left.\n\nOne of the sales guys was working with a woman who could have passed for a super model so his attention was gone. The other sales guy was working with a somewhat obnoxious elderly lady who was asking all kinds of questions that were obviously out of his scope of support. If he were a half way decent sales man he would have kindly pushed the questions off or directed the elderly somewhere else.\n\nWhile I was in the store at least 2 other customer's walked in and out. Myself, nor the other bypassing customers were acknowledged at all.\n\nFinally, I just gave up and walked out. Just as I was out of the store the guy talking to the supermodel lady asked if he could do anything (surprise). I was angry enough I said \"no\" and walked away.\n\nThis place has some of the worst customer service reps. I will not be returning!
4 ||| Gida's rocks.  I placed an order from a different state, different time zone, for a friend who was in the hospital.  They delivered next morning, it was just as I ordered, and it really made his day.  From the picture my friend took I can tell the design is just as beautiful as it was on Gida's website.  THANK YOU Gida's for being so reliable and delivering a beautiful product!!!
0 ||| I went in here around 5 pm on a weekday, there was no one in the place, that should have been my first hint that it was not going to be a good experience.  I was right, I should have just turned around and leave the place.  There selection was very poor, I couldn't even find items that you would normally find a a salad bar.   Their selection of soups was very poor, maybe 4 total.  Rolls or bread was pitiful.  The help was very lackadaisical, there didn't seem any motivation to want to work.  I watch 3 others come in to get served, it would take anywhere from 5 to 10 min. before someone would come out of the back to help them.  Amazing the customers stayed to be able to eat.  i definitely wouldn't go to this particular one. I can't comment on others, but I'd rather go to Sweet Tomatoes anytime over this place.
3 ||| Large selection of sugar free flavors and even larger selection of regular flavors! Their sugar-free is also flavored with stevia which I prefer over aspartame and other sweeteners. The portions are HUGE and the ice is perfect! Fine and powdery, just like eating real snow. They get 4 stars because of the time I got a side by side sugar free banana and sugar free toasted coconut, and my banana was definitely not sugar free. I was on a strict diet at the time and could not have ANY sugar. I called and the manager I spoke with basically told me I was wrong and that it was sugar free. He didn't offer to compensate me, offer me a free treat, or even a free punch on my card. I will continue to patronize them because that is the only issue I've ever had, but I can't forget it.
4 ||| when I moved here from san diego I knew I would miss my fav breakfast spot as they had the best monte Christo sandwich around.  so I googled monte Christo and found the Morning Star caf\u00e9.  good sandwich and the prices are great cant wait to try the other items on the menu.  Oh, they take credit cards and cash.
1 ||| This is a depressing coffee shop. I went in on a wednesday afternoon to find the place dim, muggy, eerily silent (as in no music or talk, just shuffling noises), and filled with a sense of sadness.  I tried to sit down and enjoy some coffee, which was drinkable, but I couldn't get over the odd atmosphere, that is until the music started, so quiet I couldn't even tell you what it was, just that it was on. I'm giving it two stars for the awesome alternative energy posters hanging on the far wall.
2 ||| Ate there tonight for the first time.  I do have to say the prices are very fair.  The service staff is very \"alternative\"  Lots of tats, bull nose rings, big hole ear stretch earnings, I don't mind alternative but hygiene has to be there and I felt it wasn't.\n\nThey were out of about seven menu items and the service was very slow and lacked any genuine hospitality.  I'll give it one more shot because several friends of mine rave about the place but I was not impressed with my first visit.
2 ||| The first time we came here the \"seat yourself\" sign was visible, so thats what we did. Fifteen minutes later, we left. No one ever came to greet us.... \n\nThis time, we were set immeadiately and ordered some beers. Everything started out fine... \n\n Some of the wings that came with our order were so over cooked, there was no meat left. They were the ones conveniently located at the bottom of the stack. Once we ordered our entrees, our server started coming around a lot less.... Our food took a while, it seemed. I ordered a burger, pretty basic, but when our server offered me a temp request I said medium. It came out over cooked, but still good. I hate being asked, then end up disappointed. The onion rings were delicious and my beer was AMAZING (White Russian Imperial Stout). Now, my husband order the red pepper pasta dish.... Starting off, the pasta was over cooked. The sauce was more like a butter sauce and hardly resembled red pepper anything. The green chili mac led me to the same disappointment, i just didn't think it was good (there is another place on 7th st... that green chili mac is delicious!). My husband and i both agreed the beer was great, he had the hefeweizen.  I really doubt we will return.
0 ||| Will never darken their doorway again!!!!!! I moved to the area four months ago and have surprisingly had a difficult time finding a place to buy fresh meat. I am used to the Amish markets in MD. I tried this place and was completely ignored from the moment I stepped into to the door. My visit was short and not sweet at all! I wish there was an option to not give a single star!
4 ||| I love these wings. LOVE THEM. Other locations are just not as good. My friend and I frequent this place way more than we should for lunch, usually after a workout so we can pretend to justify it. :-)  We're usually there between 11:30-12, and it's not extremely busy. The service has always been excellent. Actually, and I don't know if I should be ashamed to admit this, but the server now knows us. Today when we were there brought everything out for us. We didn't even have to order! I'm not sure how it is in the evenings, but if you want wings for lunch this is the place to go. You'll probably see us there- just look for the two in workout clothes!
2 ||| The bar was okay but the comedy show was horrible.
0 ||| Nice owner nice concept but horrible hand made maduro.   Cigar had a horrible draw and would not burn.  Sad to say I was hoping this would be a nice surprise but I am very disappointed.
3 ||| Very friendly as I entered. Shop totally dedicated to the RC hobby. Limited paint selection focusing on lexan.
0 ||| Everything about this place was terrible. It was 90 degrees inside and smelled like old grease. The woman behind the counter was down right rude to my wife when she asked about portion sizes. I ordered szechuan beef. It was inedible. They turned it into deep fried beef jerky. TERRIBLE. I don't write TERRIBLE very often about restaurants, but there is no getting around it. It was TERRIBLE. The other diners in our party had somewhat better food, but the egg drop soup smelled like CAT PISS and the huge piles of white rice that came with every order were ridiculous. Why not give us less, but make it better. I will never go again and advise you to avoid.
0 ||| Food was not a home run.  It was just so so.  Actually kind of disappointed.  Service was terrible.  In a certain way, it felt like a fast food joint.  Never coming back again
0 ||| Where to start, this nail salon looked fine, enough people were there getting manicures and pedicures, but oh my how appearances can be deceiving. Please please please don't give this horrible establishment your time and money. I went to get a French manicure for my friend's wedding, just a classic with French tip added. The woman who was working with me began by giving me ice cold water. Had me place my hands on a grimy looking towel, and didn't use any cuticle softener. Now all of my fingers are cut up, and painful. Like she gave me hang nails and cut me. The manicure itself was  below average. The woman kept getting up to talk to other workers, and the nail polish she used was so cheap it was flaking off in the car. I've never even written a bad review, but this place deserves it. And the worst part? That was $20 to get a crappy manicure and cut up fingers. This place should be shut down. Horrible experience.
3 ||| Went there to photograph a concert. Great crowd and fun quirky locals. Loved the dive bar ambience without being trashy/dirty. The lighting for the show wasn't great but the sound was good. Great beers, too. Get the 99Shillings.
1 ||| The pizza was good. But the service...\n\nI passed this place and saw an inviting sign on the window that read: \"Anytime Special.  Any 2 Slices & a Drink, $5.\" \n\nJust what I needed!\n\nI was greeted by a short blonde woman who needed to check if they still had slices. I understand, it was 3.40PM.  Sometimes slices are only available at meal times.\n\nHer - Me\n\n\"Yes, we have slice's.\" - \"Awesome!\"\n\"Pepperoni or cheese?\" - \"Actually, I'd like pepperoni and mushroom with extra sauce\"\n\"We can't do that.\" - \"Really?  You don't have mushrooms or sauce?\"\n\"We do, but the pepperoni and cheese slices are already made.\" - \"ok, can you just add it before you throw the slices in the oven?\"\n\"No\" - \"Really?  That's how lots of pizza by the slice places work...\"\n\"Ok, we'll add it.\" - \"great, thanks!\"\n\"Your total is $6.\" - \"But the sign says $5 for any 2 slices, including a drink?\"\n\"I have to charge you for the extra toppings.\" - \"But the sign says?\"\n\"The sign is incorrect, we're in litigation with the sign vendor now.\" - \"Ok, well can you honor the current offer?  Seems like you should, that's the whole reason I came in...\"\n::Lots of sighing and grunting:: \"Ok, $5.50.\" - \"Thanks!\"\n\nThere was no mention of my drink.  Fortunately I didn't need one.\n\nLike I said, decent pizza, but this confrontation was appalling.
4 ||| We loved ALL the food. Gyoza pan fried were delicious as well as the shrimp tempura. We really liked that they had seperate dipping sauces, not just some generic sauce for every plate.  I had $3 glasses of yummy house wine!\n\nMy husband got the professor vu roll and chicken and tofu yakatori and raved about it all.\n\nI had the sir justin roll (per the server's recommendation) and the dragon roll, both were fantastic but the sir justin was the clear winner.  Even my husband loved it more than anything else. Beautiful presentation of delicious and fresh fish.  \n\nService was great, our server was knowledgeable about the menu and answered all of our questions and gave great recommendations.  \n\nONLY complaint- canned sodas! My husband doesn't like alcohol and loves his soda so it was a little inconvenient.
0 ||| Currently still waiting for my food. It's over 30 minutes late and I ordered 1.5 hours ago.
4 ||| This weekend, our car broke down on the way to Fleming's for dinner...literally IN the turn lane going into the restaurant.  So disappointing.\n\nWe were able to push the car into the parking lot, and searched online for a tow company to pick it up in the morning.\n\nFast towing was able to get us scheduled, and the driver showed up a few minutes early.\n\nHe loaded the car up, and drove to the shop where we were dropping it off for repairs...he was SO much better than the last tow company we used!  \n\nIf you're in a jam, give them a try...They were really good to us this weekend.
4 ||| Wonderfully unique atmosphere.   Good coffee,  fresh & very TASTY food.  Comfy cozy to stop in for a bite or hang out all day.   Free Wifi.  Yoga in the back cottage.  Very attentive and friendly staff.  Multiple rooms to choose.  \n\nI will become a regular here.   ...And I've been searching high and low for the perfect reading spot with food and coffee.  After multiple weeks of testing various shops all over the East Valley...my coffee cup will rest here.
3 ||| This place had good food...but served 5 different varieties of Shark Fin soup.  'Nuf said.
1 ||| Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \n\nTo recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\n\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \n\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons.
3 ||| I like the food don't take me wrong is just the price, quantity n quality of the food don't seem to be equal, but nice place to have some fun with friends and family...
3 ||| I find that this pizza is edible but I am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. They have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but I prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. This pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not.
0 ||| This place recently received a score of 87 from the health dept and before that it scored a 90.  They have been re-inspected since and scored much higher but geez a 90 and an 87 - and we're talking about a SUSHI restaurant!!!  I'll never try this place - Beware!!!  See below...\n\nhttp://mecklenburg.digitalhealthdepartment.com/_templates/NC/Restaurant/_report_full.cfm?reportID=F4DA48D5-D902-C95B-4ECC104DF640F458&facilityID=F2DACC56-1422-201B-19C824BAFAFF56D7&rtype=Restaurant&domainID=16\n\nhttp://images.bimedia.net/documents/0622410+nikkos.pdf
0 ||| I was really excited about finding a gym that also offered a complete health and weight loss program. But so far I have been extremely disappointed with it. Everything that you get for free with your \"LT Bucks\" turned into an hour of wasted time for me. No real information or counseling provided, just a sales pitch to try and get you to sign up for some weekly meeting with the trainer or nutritionist that is going to cost you 100 bucks an hour. And they really put the pressure on to try and convince you that you need all these tests - metabolic rate, food allergies, cortisol levels. And each one costs hundreds of dollars. Their strategy should be to educate those of us who generally want to learn about how to have a healthier lifestyle. Then we'd be even more loyal to Lifetime and they'd make their money back tenfold over time from the $55 monthly membership fee. And only push the extras if it is genuinely needed for that individual. Instead they all just seem like used car salesmen and it almost turned me off from the whole place.\n\nFor now I am just trying to push all that noise aside and focus on just the gym, which is actually pretty nice. They have a wide variety of equipment and there is never any wait. My biggest complaint is that their group fitness classes are insanely crowded. I actually saw one girl get knocked to the ground in Zumba class last week because it was just too packed in there. Seriously!
0 ||| Palace Station is like the worse version of Imperial Palace and I mean this seriously. The rooms are even cheaper than Imperial Palace and let me tell you ... it's for a reason. \n\nRules of Palace Station:\n1) don't take off your shoes\n2) wear sandals in the shower\n3) don't lean against the walls\n4) wear lots of clothes to bed and don't cover your face with the blanket\n\nI ended up with a nice chin rash from my blanket. blech, I wonder how.\n\nThe rooms aren't nice, the casino is dirty, I don't particularly enjoy it here and it's literally if you have absolutely nowhere else to go and don't want to spend any amount of money that you should even consider this place. But you should probably check Imperial first.
3 ||| Good Chicago-style pizza, but the chicken-parm sandwich was outstanding.
4 ||| Amazing food, lovely atmosphere. Lot of the menu changes seasonally. We probably come here twice a month. I try to avoid ordering the same thing over an over (the fillet mignon is just outstanding), and I have never been disappointed.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it for a date or even a group night out.\n\nThe upstairs covered patio area is great in the summer time.
3 ||| Did you know this place existed??  I didn't either, until last weekend when the Mr and I stumbled upon it on a blustery Sunday morning.  The cafe was nearly empty, but that's OK, it's small.  We shared a 'Fair Oaks Skillet', sausage, american fries, onions, green peppers, topped with two eggs.  It was actually really good, and the service was outstanding.  Just a couple of young guys working the place, but they were great- \n\nGood visit...until...you need to find the restroom.  It's downstairs, in the back, but that's all I can tell you since my eyes were closed for much of the trip.  Eww, eww, eww.\n\nWill we be back? Not tomorrow, but someday.
3 ||| This is one of the hardest places to walk by when you're in the Strip and not be tempted to walk in to. If you're a chocolate lover who's looking for some variety, you'll be overwhelmed and satisfied. Looking for gelato in the warmer months? Head to the back fo the store for something delicious! There's really not much else to the store other than a great selection of chocolates from nearly every corner of the globe.\n\nThe negatives are the service and the prices. Some of the chocolates that you'll find at Mon Aimee can be found significantly cheaper at places like Wegman's (if you're lucky enough to live near one), and we've spent a premium on certain candies in the past that we knew we could get cheaper elsewhere. Sometimes the convenience is worth it, though.\n\nAs for the service, it's a mixed bag. Generally, I've had trouble getting service when looking at the chocolates in the cases, and the staff never seems to be in a friendly mood. While I GUESS they're doing their customers a favor by procuring such a vast variety of chocolate, I'm not sure they should ACT like they're doing us a favor by existing. This strange air of arrogance has always been a turnoff, but what can I say...they have delicious treats;)
0 ||| This place sucks. I work nearby and thought I would give them a shot. Bad mistake. Took over 50 minutes after the car came out of the wash!!! Really?? 50 mins to dry a car? \n\nDo yourself a favor and NEVER GO HERE!!!!!!! Even if your retired and have all day, go somewhere else!!!
4 ||| I took my two a bit difficult German shepherds in for a bath and nails and they did a great job. They also said my dogs behaved well. I'm sure they lied, but it made me feel good.
3 ||| I have stayed here twice as part of a flight/hotel package through Fun Jet out of Kansas City.  It was actually a fun place to gamble.  There's a shuttle that runs back and forth from Palace Station to the strip, but it doesn't run very late.  Be prepared to take a cab back if you are out late on the strip.  \n\nThe rooms were OK.  The buffet was pretty good and cocktail service was above average in my experience.    Not my top choices of places to stay because of its location, but it's not at all bad and usually a bargain.
4 ||| We've just arrived at the ER at St Joes Hospital. \nWe're now in one of the curtained off areas & I've gotta say I'm impressed.  \n\nWhen you walk into the ER at St Joes expect to be greeted by a triage team - immediately.  They don't mess around. Everyone has a job, knows their job & they do it well here at St Joes ER. They're very efficient.  The Dr. came in right away, he was nice, seems to be more than competent & every single nurse has been kind & compassionate. \n\nAs the initial team of nurses worked on my Bob, there were more nurses lined up on the other side of the curtain with their machines to test him, draw blood, etc. \n\nWe didn't know what to expect at St Joes - but we have to say they're very efficient here at St Joes Hosp & so far- we're very impressed!  :)
2 ||| Three things:\n1. Our server was very kind (black chick).\n2. Another server was a bitch, rolling her eyes at our request for new utensils, since we received dirty ones (blonde chick). She did not grant our request.\n3. Wings were below average. It filled me up, but did not satisfy.
4 ||| I had a vegetarian bagel here this morning: Hummus and veggies. It was good. Not much to be said for bagels, although I know there are those who are quite picky. For me, the hummus alternative is enough as long the bagels are good (which IMHO, it was).\n\nThe other nice feature about Brueggers is that they provide free wifi. It's evening now, the bagel store is closed, and I'm sitting in the Starbucks next door using the free Brueggers wifi rather than the paid Starbucks/T-Mobile. Thanks, Brueggers!
3 ||| I had a Groupon for this place and after looking at the menu online, I was excited to try it. I adore Chipotle and that type of fresh mexican style food, so this seemed perfect. Yeah, not so much... \n\nI had the shrimp bowl which is apparently new to the menu. Maybe they need more practice or refining on this item because it was not good. The rice was bitter, the veggies tasted like burned oil, and the shrimp were chewy. The only semi-redeeming things for this meal were the pico and guac that I added. My husband had the 2 taco combo and he said it was \"meh...\".  We had to spend $15 to fulfill the Groupon so we got a churro - yum!!\n\nI dint think we'll be going back any time soon... Chipotle has won our business.
2 ||| Chan Am of Crafton. A So-So Chinese restaurant. Absolutely nothing special about this place. The Lunch Special for 5.35 isn't too bad, though. I tried the General Tso's(of course) and it was not the tastiest I've ever had(-1). They are eat in and pick up only(-1).\nAll in All, if I'm desperate I might order again, but probably not.
4 ||| I took up fly fishing a while back, and you can find whatever you want in that regard at Jesse Brown's.  Lately they have been my stop of choice when shopping for Tevas or Keens.  They didn't have the Teva flip-flops I was looking for, but the guy showed me Keens and now I never take the dang things off my feet!  A good collection of the \"Life Is Good\" clothing line can also be found here.  \n\nThis particular location is in the shopping area across from SouthPark Mall, and is up on the second level.
0 ||| We went to Pedro's tonight for dinner.  We haven't been there in a couple of years, after having a mediocre dinner last time.  We thought we would give it another try.  BIG BIG BIG Mistake.\n\nThe place is filthy.  The entrance is a mess with cigarette butts all over.  The booths are appalling with the fabric frayed to the point that the foam rubber is showing.  There is dirt on every surface.\n\nThe food was awful.  The chips were very salty and the salsa is bland and uninspired.\nThe enchiladas (chicken) had little chicken.  The waiter brought my dinner and a lemon on the platter fell onto the table as he was delivering it.  Instead of taking it and getting another HE PICKED IT UP off of the table and placed it in the middle of my plate.\n\nThe restaurant will close sometime soon---no question about it.   There is so much deferred maintenance, the place is filthy, the food disgusting and the wait staff and management a group of amateurs who have no vested interest in providing good service.\n\nI remember the Pedro's of years ago and it bares no resemblance to the disgusting restaurant it has become\n\nIf the cleanliness of the public spaces is any indicator I would hate to see what the kitchen looks like. I hope the health department makes a surprise visit sometime soon.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS.
4 ||| A big, comfortable place which has a great decor. The food is great, good price and server fast. They even have a salsa bar so you don't have to wait to get more chips and salsa. Works well for a couple or 20.
4 ||| A lovely place to visit while in or near Phoenix.  The Desert Botanical Garden is serene and beautiful. It gives you the opportunity to see things many of us are not familiar with, especially if you're from the east coast.\n\nThe large variety of cacti and flowers is somewhat breathtaking. Even on hot days, there are patches of shade around to get some relief from the sun.  Although there are water fountains throughout the trail, the water is very warm, so think about bringing your own and don't forget a hat!\n\nSavings Bonus:  They offer a AAA discount which saved us $3(?) per person.\n\nIts a great was to spend a morning or afternoon.
3 ||| The Good:  Great, friendly service with a smile and laid back atmosphere.\n\nThe Bad:  The crust was not all that I thought it would be. Instead of being dense and buttery, it was really light and fluffy. Not what I was expecting from a deep dish crust. Normally eating 1 or 2 slices of Chicago deep dish is enough to make you throw in the towel but I ate 4 slices and ehh, not so much stuffed. The sauce was awesome however.\n\nThe Ugly:  Spinach on pizza was undercooked and slimy. Probably just a fluke this time but still off-putting. If you are looking to listen to loud tv's and drink, go to Native New Yorker. Several people found this out the hard way that they can't turn the volume up louder after ordering 5 pitchers of beer, only to give it away for free to people sitting behind them so they could leave for Native.
0 ||| Starwood Hotels, you really let us down. We booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in Charlotte. We arrived at the hotel via the courtesy van. While the front desk girl and shuttle guy were pleasant, that's pretty much the only thing I can say were positives of this experience. \n\nFirst, our room reeked of incense (FYI, non-smoking also includes pot smoke). Next, we went down to the lobby area to eat dinner. When we tried to order, we were told that they were \"out\" of both items we requested. Then, the items we did order tasted like the equivalent of a Stouffer's microwave dinner and the dessert was rubbery and a waste of money.\n\nNext, in the morning, when we went to get ready, we had to bathe in our own dirt because the shower drain was clogged. I literally filled the tub with shower water that didn't go down all the way until we were almost ready to check out. That's just nasty!\n\nWhen we got downstairs my husband asked an employee if they had a kiosk to check in for our flight (many hotels have this now). He said they didn't but directed us to the business center to print our passes via their computer. He failed to mention that the printer wasn't working. So I went through the whole thing for nothing. \n\nI typically don't pay for or book hotels through full-price sites (in this case spg. com) but we wanted to make sure we were super close to the airport and up until this experience I had always had all positives to say about Starwood Hotels (owners of Sheraton, Westin, W, Four Points, etc.).  We paid about $200 for the room before taxes and fees and I won't ever do that again. I had a better stay at a Holiday Inn off Hotwire for $85!\n\n Also, once again, no free WiFi...which pretty much puts this on the no-go list!
4 ||| Delicious prickly pear and boysenberry although a little too sweet.  Live music.  Comfortable.
4 ||| Spent first night here and room was very hot with even hotter air blowing from a/c. Opened windows only to find you need maint to close the window. Maid never cleaned the room the first day. \n\nI give it 5 stars because Samantha, the manager and Dan, the general manager were incredibly hospitable, more than any staff we've encountered. I travel over 1/2 the month and stay in countless hotel rooms. \n\nSamantha apologized immediately, comped our stay and Dan took me from room to room until we were satisfied. He then rectified the a/c problem for the entire hotel. \n\nOur daughter lives here and we will continue to stay at this hotel in the future. \n\nThank you Marriott, especially Samantha!!:)
3 ||| Have always been a fan of Jamba Juice, if you're looking for a refreshing drink that is at least remotely healthy JJ is the place to go.\n\nThe only problem with this particular Jamba Juice is consistency, sometimes I'll go in and get a nice and full cup of juice, other times they only partially fill my drink and dump the extra down the sink :(.\n\nOverall, a good place to grab a quick healthy juice.
2 ||| Nothing bad, nothing great. Breakfast, an omelet, was very average and the service was fair.\n\nBeing a chain Le Peep is a know quantity and reliable. Reliable, as in average.
3 ||| Wow, they'll let anybody open up a hotel, huh?  I guess I'll just wait for the Walmart hotel or Google hotel.  Or better yet, how about the Yelp hotel!  Sweet!\n\nAs for this restaurant, it's pretty much the same as any other hooters.  The wings are good (not great) and beer flows freely.  The women are scantily clad and the \"A\" team is good and the \"B\" team isn't half bad either.  However, the \"C\" team is ugly.  \n\nOne thing that they do different here is that they take a picture when you walk in.  You take it with like 3 or 4 girls, but when you actually see the picture, there's like twice as many.  What's that about?!?!\n\nSide note:  I won $250 on the 25 cent Wheel of Fortune machine.  Give it a shot and see if you can win more money to infuse back into the Vegas economy.
4 ||| I have tried this place a few times now. The first time I went, the lady behind the counter talked to us and told us about the different dishes. She offered a generous sample of the gyro meat with the tzatki (sp) sauce. I never liked lamb, but this was very tasty! My family has ordered assorted dishes, of the assorted meat plate with rice and veggies, soulvaki, pork pita, steak sandwhich/pita,and I had the chicken pita and the chicken salad. The food here is fresh and home made. I love the sauce and always end up getting extra. The bread is wonderful and I would order a second pita for an extra .70 cents! All the meat was perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious. The vegetables were fresh and no sign of browing. The place is a casual atmosphere and clean. I learned the lady's name is Oiudad and although she seems stern, she is very nice, the more she gets to know you she warms up. By the end of our last visit, my 26 yr old stepson gave her a big hug.\nWe tried the home made baklava and it is out of this world delicious! This will be a spot we will return to over and over. They even have chicken nuggets, pasta, and hamburgers for the not so adventurous or kidlets to please everyone. I do wish they would get some brewed iced tea to add on the drink menu. That would be the only thing I would change.  But I can overlook that for this gem!
2 ||| You won't have a terrible meal at Tutto, but you won't have an outstanding one either.  Overall, it's a solid choice if you're on State Street and feel like Italian in an outdoor cafe.\n\nThe pizza had potential, but it came with too much cheese and not quite hot enough.  The chicken parm would have fit in well at the Olive Garden.  The pene in red sauce was good but the portion was enough for two-plus.\n\nOverall a solid three star, possibly a four if you're going through a bottle of wine and sitting outside on a pleasant evening.
0 ||| A guy to my right is eating chicken wings and throwing the bones behind the bar.Lady bartender says\"what the hell\",she cut him off and called a cab and told him to leave.He gave her some lip and she repeatedly asked him to leave then she came from behind the bar with a can of mace and then he left.I didn't feel safe here and it was only 4pm in the afternoon.
4 ||| The pharmacists and pharmacist assistants at this CVS pharmacy are absolutely wonderful.  Super fast, very organized and they are all extremely friendly.  I am so thankful that we switched from another chain pharmacy to this CVS - the customer service level is night and day compared to our last pharmacy.  Way to go CVS!
4 ||| Should you find yourself on a vacation to Las vegas you must try Capriottis sandwich shop. It is a locals staple. They are located all over Vegas, and you must add it to your list of \"to-do's\" while there. I
3 ||| Nice sit-down Chinese place.  What else is there to say?
0 ||| Not an honest place.  They charged me $1200 to fix my air compressor and told me they put in a new one.  Less than a year later I had to get it fixed again. This time it was fixed for $800 at a different shop.  They told me the one that was put in was not new but a rebuilt one that was cleaned up to look new.  Avoid this place and other automotive places that try to rip people off because they don't know any better.  You will notice I usually only go on to make good reviews but the automotive repair industry needs to be exposed until they stop trying to take advantage of people.
3 ||| My wife and I went to Chianti for our anniversary.  And, we had a 20% off coupon.  We started with the garlic bread and as an appy ordered the cheesy artichoke dip (Carciofi Gratinati).  Both were wonderful, as were the drinks on the specials menu.  For our entrees, we ordered the Margherita pizza and the eggplant parm (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The pizza was.....OK, nothing to write home about, but the eggplant parm was absolutely perfect, with the accompanying pasta served perfectly al dente.  We mentioned to the excellently attentive waiter that it was our anniversary, and he brought out a huge slice of tiramisu for our dessert, without our asking for it, and without charging us for it!  And when he brought out the check, we noticed he'd taken the 20% off the entire meal, including alcohol.  Doesn't get any better than that.  Now if they could only make the pizza a little more enticing, they'd earn five stars.
3 ||| Good for window shopping, but not much else. Sleepy Poet may have bit off more than it could chew in classifying itself as an antique mall. First appearances lead me to believe that it's more of an artist commune and clothing store. I was overwhelmed with and slightly disappointed in the volume of finished 'artsy pieces'.  I've been to a number of antique malls that have successfully incorporated both handmade art and antiques - but the Poet seems to lean too heavily on the handmade art. With that being said, they do have a large quantity of vintage clothing pieces, but that and their free popcorn will not get me through the door again.\n\nThe staff are nice and I did find one small item to purchase (vintage military duffle bag), but price-wise I could have done much better online for the condition. Also use caution if you're needing to use a store supplied shopping cart to carry your potential purchases. With narrow aisles and a number of booths filled with large items that that stick out, I found myself bumping into things that could have been potentially costly to me. My hubby and I abandoned our cart mid-way through our visit for fear of knocking something or someone over.\n\nPrices for a few other items that caught my eye were in the upper moderate to high range which made me think twice about buying anything else. Usually, when I see a piece I have to have and know it's a good value - I get it. Not in this case since I found myself checking the price before falling in love with anything. I also found that there appears to be a few vendors that have similar booths set-up here as well as other local antique malls I've visited - however the prices appeared higher at the Poet. Not sure if they felt the need to raise their prices due to the location. \n\nHandmade art pieces and vintage clothing, yes ...reasonably priced antiques, not so much.
4 ||| My fav breakfast place in Phoenix!\n\nYou get: great food, great atmosphere, good service (parking a little bit of a challenge, but I live right across the street so I just walk).  They even have drive up take out service!\n\nI mostly eat the breakfast there but have had sandwiches as well as the pizza at the Pizzeria next door.  Delicious!  Anyone who gives LGO negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring Phoenix restaurant style type eating.  LGO is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  Coffee is great (and strong). Daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)\n\nYes, prices are a little higher than average in Phoenix....but you get what you pay for.\n\nWe love coming here after a good hike at Squak Peak or Camelback! Fresh squeed OJ is great and fresh made english muffines are yummy.
3 ||| I come here often and get one dish, so my review is a bit limited.  \nUdon Chicken Noodle soup. \nI love it.  \nNow here is an example of how I am easy to please, I think...cause a coworker told me about Udon soup they had in California, and it made what I eat here sound like high school culinary class food.  But, I still like Yasda's.  \nThe broth, the chicken, and the noodles are all very very tasty to me.  There is a little fried tempura piece of...uhm...something on top, which I personally like how it gets all soggy for me to eat with the soup.  And they give you a side of white rice to soak everything up if you'd like - and its a nice amount of rice.\nNothing special.  At all.  But it does me good on the colder days at lunch.  \nAnd I like the service.  First time I came here, I didn't have cash for a drink.  The lady slid me a cup on the sly:)  There's two of them that usually work the counter and they are always very friendly.\nNow, I will admit the layout inside is jacked up.  When it gets busy, the line wraps around a chunk of tables smack dab in the middle.  So you got people trying to eat while folks are hovering over them, talking and letting drops of saliva fly out....ok, i'll stop.  Then there's a bunch of tables on the right side of the place too close together.  I like to sit at the table against the window to people watch, and deal with the least of the crowdiness.  The drink and condiment stations are too close together and its a dance-off trying to get your chili garlic while someone else is trying to get a coke. \nAlso, their sushi options are so limited that they shouldn't even have it on the menu.\n\nBut...I dunno, I really like the place.  Its where I go when I can't decide, and when I'm having a downer of a day.  I'm going to try other dishes...eventually...maybe...probably not:)
4 ||| Amazing variety of authentic Japanese dishes.  Very good service.  Great sashimi.  Great eats off the strip.  Good pricing.  Gets busy so find a time that works.
4 ||| I have been going here for some time. My foot was operated on 7 times by other doctors. I was told I was at the end. Amputation was in my Vocabulary. I was making a choice of going to the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. I made one last effort to see Dr. Zang from this office. I have heard nothing but GREAT remarks about this man.\n\nYes, I agree and all the doctors are aware of the front desk issues. And I assure you the Board is working on that issue. I have personsonaly spoke to several Docs and nurses on the front desk. And I wrote a letter to the board on this issue. \n\nAnyways, seriously get past the front desk and you DO get the ABSOLUTE  BEST CARE EVER!!!  The docs are worth the wait and hassle from the front desk. \n\nMy first appt with Zang. He knew my Issue immediately and brought in Dr Kroleski to check me out. (The great news is - she trained at the Cleveland Clinic- so Zangs joke on the first day is Tammy I will bring the Cleveland Clinic to you). Dr. Kroleski is rated one of the top Docs at the Cleveland Clinic. And Dr. Zang is a TOP NOTCH DOCTOR IN AZ. \n\nThis office performed a couple surgeries on me. Mostly making repairs from my previous doctors. And my foot is better than ever. Amputation is out of the question as long as I do what the doctors advised me. They did their part now it's up to me to do mine. \n\nDr Zang designed some artificial parts, which I have in my right foot. I don't care if it's the smallest problem from clipping toe nails to your foot falling off. This office is a God Sent. \n\nThey did not pay me, not even asked me for a review. But as I read some reviews I'm shaking my head. I personally know what this office is capable of doing. \n\nIn order to heal YOU MUST DO YOUR PART. THE DOCS CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. THE REST IS UP TO US TO DO OUR PART FOR HEALING!!!\n\nI did give 5 Stars because of the knowledge of the docs. Which takes away from the front desk issue. Once ur behind that door and your with the doc you actually forget about the girls upfront. \n\nDr Zang and Kroleski. You both ROCK!!!
3 ||| Thad did a really good job on my heart tattoo.  The place is kind of old and dingy but the work area environment was sterile.\nI would defiantly let Thad do another tattoo for me.
0 ||| Do not go here.   Misdirection, Misdiagnosis, Miscommunication.  Result: Our sweet dog died the next day.
3 ||| This is the only PTs I will regularly visit. Every OTHER PTs location I have been has left a bad taste in my mouth (sometimes literally) for the chain. At this location however, the prices are decent (especially during Happy Hour), the standard bar food is a little more costly then I would expect for the location, which reminds me that it's a PTs. The Bartenders always manage to find time to stop and greet their customers, and Dale (Bartneder) remembered my beer on my second visit (2 weeks later).\n\nIf you've been to any of the PTs throughout town before and weren't satisfied, give this location a try before giving up on the chain entirely. If you do happen to enjoy the other locations, this one will probably rock your socks!\n\nBe forewarned though, there tends to be really loud, somewhat ridiculous karaoke here on some nights...
3 ||| REALLY GREAT!!!! Everything was awesome. The only issue I have is that there is a long wait to get food, but that should tell you something.
4 ||| Thought they had closed down. Not so! Just a new sign. Also, closed on tuesdays.\n\nExcellent Sonoran-style hot dog: bacon wrapped with beans, tomato, mayo, mustard, etc. As good as the best I've had in Tucson (el Nene, Ruiz), and better than Moreno's down the street (they are not bacon wrapped as a Sonoran dog should be; Mickey's are).
2 ||| the phone number is disconnected. and it looks like a new smoothie place has replaced this. it used to be next to as you wish, right? and it stinks cuz I have groupons that I intended to use at this location.
0 ||| I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.
3 ||| It was pretty tasty and the prices were good. We called in our order, walked in and payed. Then waited 20 minutes until I asked where was our food. They handed me a bag that was sitting behind them the whole time so our food was now cold and not as fresh. Service is were they lacked.
3 ||| Homey place with bad lighting. It adds a little twist to normal American Chinese fare. Different, yet tasty flavors than the average Lo Mein parlor. Well prepared. Not deep fried goop like most strip mall Chinese joints.I would go back again if I'm in the area.\n\nVery friendly staff. Watch out for Karaoke night on Fridays....Very, very loud. However, the pregnant lady DJ sang the most  hauntingly beautiful version of Fleetwood Mac \"Dreams\" which made it alright. Brought me to the brink of tears it was so good.
0 ||| Me and my wife ate here years ago and I am not planning on going back to update this review, so here it goes. Wow talk about bad tasting food, never and I mean never in my life have the walked out leaving the whole plate of food on the table and still paid for the meal. It had no taste what so ever, I mean I grew up in a little mexican town so I know what it should taste like and it was not even close. Taco Bell has better tasting mexican food. Oh and my wife threw up in the parking lot so you know how her experience was. Just bad food.
0 ||| My first LGA experience...won't be back unless someone begs me. Omelette was served cold, too busy to care what the plate looked like and no silverware clean. The place was packed. Why?
3 ||| I camped out at the Lost Dutchman State Park, but it was raining in the morning, and I was hungry. So I got on yelp to see what I could find nearby. I liked the name of this place, so I packed up camp and headed on over. I had the green chili and cheese omelet with homefries and wheat toast. The omelet was super fabulous, but the home fries had more to do with frozen diced potatoes than home, and the \"toast\" was barely toasted. The service was great though - the waitress was very attentive. I'll go back, but probably not for the homefries.
4 ||| We grabbed up a Groupon for this museum which was for the Adult's Night Out Da Vinci exhibit viewing.  We loved it!  \n\nI'm a touch confused by some of the other reviewers on here that went and complained about parking and screaming children. First, park in the Science Center parking garage and they validate (so it's free).  Second, it's a museum...kids go there so it's a tad unrealistic to expect them to not be there unless you are going to Adult's Night Out - which is why we purchased the ticket we purchased.  We don't have kids just yet, and wanted a date night.  Bam!  Adult's Night Out to the rescue!  \n\nThe Da Vinci exhibit is closed now, however it was very well organized and set up.  The catered food was delicious and well presented.  The staff was helpful in guiding us when we needed it.  \n\nAll in all, a great night out!  Grab a Groupon and make it a date night.  ;)
2 ||| Still on a search to find good, authentic Chinese food in No. Scottsdale, we decided to give Sesame Inn a try.  Bottom line is ... we are still searching.  First clue that it wasn't going to go well ... no chopsticks on the table and we were never offered any.  Second clue ... after ordering, the waitress said, \"That comes with white rice.\"  To say that to a Chinese couple is like a slap in the face.  Of course it should come with white rice!  The food is edible, but I wouldn't rave about it .  I could make the same dishes at home for a fraction of the price. The previous review by Flippitti is right on.  It's certainly not worth the prices.  In fact, the size of the portions you are served make it a complete ripoff.  We had the chicken with string beans and the salt and pepper shrimp.  I am 5'1\" and 105 lbs. and could have eaten both orders by myself.  Needless to say, we left hungry and $36 poorer.  The salt and pepper shrimp is traditionally made with the shell still on and at some Chinese restaurants with the head on.  Their version (we assume to cater to American tastes) is made without the shells.  In order to accomplish this, they coat the shrimp with a dry, cardboard tasting flour mixture.  Then to disguise the fact that for $17, they are only serving you 8 small/medium size (not even large) shrimp, they pile them on top of a bed chopped green onions and cilantro.  By the way, the order of white rice that they so generously gave us with the entrees, was larger than the 2 entrees combined!  What was more amazing is that people kept coming in.  We couldn't understand it . Don't people get that they are paying out the nose for mediocre, pseudo Asian/Chinese food?  Would rather make the drive to Nee House in PV or even Chandler/Phoenix to get our Chinese food fix.
0 ||| Lets start with Service... The service is pretty damn horrible. When I always go to Pho Kim Long I feel like I'm not wanted there. I feel that if your gonna open up a business that \"Serves\" people, then SERVE the people. This place has the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. \n\nFood. its eh nothing to boast about.\n\nIf I could give this place half of 1/4 of a star I would =\\\n\nPS. if you want thai tea just go next door to LEE's Sandwiches .. they at least get it to you.
0 ||| Ive been to Phat Burrito several times now and I guess each time I just hope I was wrong the last...or maybe I just forget how unimpressed I am.  \n\nThe venue itself is in a great location (yay Southend!). The place itself is very low-key artsy/boho-esque...basically just what you should expect of Southend. \n\nThe service is where things start going downhill slightly- It's never been good. The staff aren't friendly neighborhood joint workers (unlike CM across the street)- in fact they don't really even answer their phones with polite faux-enthusiasm. Ive paid extra for Guacamole - and never received it...when I politely told them this I wasn't even offered an apology-or even some free Guac the next time. Oh well.  All of this I could let go if they had kick-butt Southwestern fare but I am sorry to say they do not. \n\nThe salsa's and Guacamole (sadly) are very bland. I worry about the freshness factor since they are basically left out all day (salsa's only). I ordered some Quesadillas- what no sour cream, lettuce, tomato, salsa, anything?! What is southwestern and/or mexican food without all the scrumptious sides? \n\n I still haven't found a good take out Mexican with take-out prices....
4 ||| My second lunch during Spring 2012 Restaurant Week was at Grape Street with a doctor I work with.  It w as three course meal featuring: a Burrata Toast Point with Roasted Red Pepper and Prosciutto Drizzled with 18 Year Old Balsamic Vinegar and Truffle Oil; Land and Sea Sliders-Dungeness Crab Cakes with a Caper Aioli on a Brioche Roll and a Sirloin Burger with Vermont Extra Sharp Cheddar, Caramelized Onions and an Asian Slaw with a Light Rice Wine Vinaigrette; and Toasted Lemon Pound Cake (Made In House) with Fresh Blackberries, Strawberries and Blueberries with Fresh Whipped Cream.  Since I don't like fish, I had two sirloin sliders.  \n\nThe staff was courteous and there was no problem with the substitution.  They were there to serve but not to the point of interfering with our conversation.  Excellent job!
2 ||| As so many reviews begin... I purchased a Groupon. \n$25 for 60 minute massage. It was money very well spent. I received the best massage ever from Tammy! She was so intuitive and new exactly what to do.\n\nI ended up coming back and having some adjustments done. The rest of the staff is nice and friendly, but not spectacular. I scheduled another massage but was told Tammy was no longer there. I still got the massage but it was not even close to as good.\n\n5 Stars for Tammy. 3 for the rest of the place.
0 ||| I've given Mermaid quite a few chances.  I have never been pleased with the work.\n\nThe outside of the car is always dripping; the interior glass/dash was smeared and looked worse than when I went in.  I make the extra drive down to Octopus.
3 ||| Having someone else, nay, a team of people washing your car is a wonderful thing. It's a brilliant dance of suds, vacuums, towels, sprays and wipes swirling around like Fantasia. It's really not that glamorous, but it's a brilliant system they have going on. Very efficient and certainly adoptive of the \"assembly line\" type of business. These dudes and dudettes can crank out a \"clean\" vehicle in no time. \n\nThe mechanized car wash does a pretty decent job. Sprays most nooks and crannies with maybe a spot missed here and there. The wax and Rain-Ex finish is a nice touch. I like seeing those summertime rain drops zing off of my windshield like a bad habit. A little too spotty on the wheels, though. Some large spots were missed and not tended to, but hey, it's not like it's the end of the world. \n\nThe only big flaw that came out of my experience was the interior of our car. Pools of water in cupholders, dirt still on the seats and floor mats, and the inside of our windshield wasn't wiped down nearly at all. I'm still trying to get smudges out from the guys who attempted to get this done. A bit annoying, but not the worst thing that could happen. \n\nAuto Bell is a great service if you don't have the resources to do it yourself. The prices can vary on which service you choose, so I'm not sure that all pricepoints would really be worth the dollar amount for the service we had rendered. May be back if need be! In the meantime, thanks, Auto Bell!
0 ||| Seriously Carolina's? This place is not at all what I expected it to be. It's busy. There was a line bigger than the restaurant... But super disappointing once my food arrived... 45 minutes later. I got a machaca burrito (apparently that's what the rave was about) and was completely dissatisfied. My husband had the shredded beef tacos and a green tamale (dry with sweet masa, BLEH). Nothing to write home about. I've been searching far and wide for an authentic Mexican food place and these Arizona places are nothing compared to the real food back home in the streets of LA! You people have no idea what good food is... Sorry.
2 ||| So someone my girlfriend knew said that this was THE place to try.  Well with this advice, my girlfriend and I went and spent a good half hour trying to find the place.  After the drive we were starving so we needed food.  The place looked incredibly tacky as well as the fact that it was all white.  And considering the fact that I have a dark complexion, I stood out like a sore thumb.  The food was alright, but it was not worth the drive nor the stares.  So if someone says that you have to try this place, just assume they were high and didn't know what they were talking about when they went...I obviously learned the hard way.
2 ||| ok.  based on beer alone, 5 stars.  service, 3.  the food, no, it's yucky-- don't go here to eat if you're a vegetarian.  the veggie burger tasted good, but the texture was like seared vomit.  vegetarians, stick to pretzels.  on the plus side, if you're local, you can get cases in the business office for cheap during business hours.
3 ||| I used to frequent Volcano Tea often during high school; it's where my friends and I liked to hang out and enjoy boba beverages. I stopped visiting a few years ago, primarily due to my lack of interest in boba and also because I wasn't in Chinatown as much.\n\nAnyway, sometimes I still have a craving for boba and fortunately I was in Chinatown today when it happened. The space has changed a bit with a lot less room to sit since there's more counter/work area to accommodate the addition of snow ice. It was relatively busy, but I was able to order as I entered and waited just a few minutes for my drink.\n\nI love milk tea with boba, so I always order one with just a variation of flavor. Today I went with a Large Taro Milk Tea - with boba, of course ($3.95 with tax). The tea wasn't too sweet and the boba was fabulous - soft and chewy! Oh, so yummy! I guess it's been a while since I've had good boba, but this is the stuff. I'll be back for more when I'm in the mood!
4 ||| I came here for breakfast/brunch and it was delicious! I had biscuits and gravy with a side of home fries and a cup of hot chocolate. \n\nThe biscuits and gravy were better than other places I have been to. The biscuits were cooked and not moist or floury. The gravy was also scrumptious not too many spices just good. It had bit of sausage and was great!\n\nThe home fries were pieces of sliced potatoes and not greasy at all. They were excellent. \n\nThe hot chocolate was also delicious. Sweet and creamy. \n\nOverall it was good!! No complaints here!
3 ||| The only bad thing bad about this place is they are a cleveland browns bar and I am a diehard steelers fan. Food is friggin awesome and pizza is half off on the week ends. Chicken wings are equally awesome with ranch that is utterly addictive. And for all the fools below hating about the  smoking. Dude it's a bar. A BAR. Get over it.   More people need to go here
4 ||| I've bought shoes, a sweet 3-compartment insulated Head bag, grip, and had my rackets restrung there several times. Always satisfied by their professionalism, speed, and courtesy. There's no shoddy salesman tactics, no unkept promises about restringing (done same day or next), and I always leave happy.\n\nI highly recommend Don's to all tennis players, new and experienced.\n\nThanks Don's
0 ||| Wow. Employees who should be working r pumping money into the juke box playing music. When customers who are paying to keep the lights on have to wait 2 hear they're songs. The server just informed me that ill have to wait 8 plus songs to here what I played...I'm a paying customer. Really WFT. Someone  needs 2 fire this bitch. Oh wait her sister is the bar manager. That'll never happen. Hey jimmy and bob wake the fuck up and clean house. Your shit is gonna go down hill.Demographics   have change
2 ||| I had lunch at China King.  It's pretty standard Chinese place.  The restaurant was pretty full.  The food is not made to order, but in batches which are kept in a steam table where you order.  I had the General's chicken which was $6.25 and came with an eggroll.  I'm pretty sure you can get a chicken wing instead of the eggroll  The food was hot and pretty tasty.  It satisfied my craving for Chinese.  Not much to say here really. Next time I would go for the chicken wing instad of the eggroll which was kind of soggy after sitting around.  If you want inexpensive fast Chinese food then try the China King, but don't expect much more than inexpensive, fast, Chinese.
2 ||| Tucked away in the complex corner and a little hard to find. Came here with a friend to check out the specials. Plus it is close to my work. Nice!\n\nInside has the basic Chinese theme going on with lighting that could be improved. It was hard to see the menu and even the food. Now where is my trusty flashlight app?\n\nOrdered the Hunan Beef lunch special and my friend went with something that had sweet and sour sauce. It may have been Lemon Chicken. They both came out with a small cup of the soup of the day. That day it was Egg Drop with small pieces of corn in it.\n\nThe food was basically the standard Americanized deal. The sauces are pretty heavy and you end up finishing your plate with a spoon. Both dishes were good and could easily be ordered for take out and it would probably not make much of a difference.\n\nService was decent with a small language barrier. It was fun watching them deliver the different orders to the tables. They had a small push cart and it would travel slowly around the room. \n\nThe best part to this restaurant is the value. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are rather large. Give them a visit and see what you think. FORTUNE COOKIE SAYS ... !\n\n3.25 STARS
3 ||| I visited this place on 9/1/2013. I love that they are open 24 hours. I recently moved to the area and after a long day of moving my husband and I were very hungry. We used to eat at Julioberto's in Phoenix (see my review on them), and I was skeptical about Filiberto's after hearing they are nothing like Julio's. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge, like a Julio's, but the food was different. My husband's Chimichanga was great! and I enjoyed the burrito/taco combo I got as well. I like Filiberto's beans better than those served at Julioberto's. We each got a huge combo and split a drink (with a side of sour cream) for under $20, which, for the portions, is very fair. If we weren't so hungry, we could have easily split a combo, which we often do at Julio's. \nAnother thing I appreciated about this place was that they got my order correct. At Julio's I often was missing little extra add-ons, or they would get my drink order wrong. Nothing devastating, just irritating and Filiberto's GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!!\nIf you're looking for a late night tasty Mexican feast for cheap-- LOOK NO FURTHER and go to Filiberto's!
1 ||| Surviving the summer heat in Phoenix can be a test of one's resourcefulness. One can retreat to the air-conditioned comfort of one's home, but then one also has to pay the piper when the power bill arrives. Accordingly, Phoenicians tend not to crank the air conditioners down to the frosty extremes familiar to folks in more temperate climates. Besides, it's a \"dry heat\", right? So you learn how to accommodate a looser, somewhat warmer definition of \"room temperature\" when you live here.\n\nI discovered that in order to be comfortable in my own home on hot summer nights, I immediately have to strip off my workclothes and promptly don my woobs. Woobs is a word I stole from Kevin Smith (of Clerks fame) for your lounge-around pajama-like comfy cozy clothes. And the more ventilated the woobs the better... so I discovered the appeal of tank tops, pajama shorts, and flip flops.\n\nI needed some more inventory to add to my woobs wardrobe, and had a helluva time locating tank tops (not undershirts) without ridiculous corporate logos or graphics. Some department stores seem to not carry them at all... I guess wife-beating isn't as popular as it once was. It suddenly flashed on me that this would possibly be an item they sold at Old Navy, since most of their clothing is affordable and fairly straightforward, fashion-wise.\n\nI did find men's tank tops in my size at Old Navy, so that was a plus. However, these were a little more of a scoop neck that I really prefer--and a mite snug for someone of my rotundity. Out of sheer desperation to add more pairs to the rotation, I bought two shirts (whose gonna see me in my PJs anyhow?). Unfortunately, after washing, these shirts got even tighter and appear even more low cut than when I tried them on the store. Now when I try them on, I see an oafish Freddy Mercury wannabe looking back at me (hairy chest resplendent!). Only when my looser, less flamboyant sleeveless shirts are in the wash do I now even dare to wear my Old Navy purchases. Clothing shopping lesson learned.\n\nNonetheless, I have managed to find some other decent bargains at this Old Navy store. I snagged a western shirt for $10.50 and a decent hoodie for $12 recently. I'm just gonna steer clear of the \"Bears Shop Here\" aisle.
4 ||| My wife and I went here with another couple last night.  All of us are very white and very non-Korean so I was concerned about the service we would receive after reading a few reviews on Yelp.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the service.  Our waiter was very friendly and fast and answered any questions with a smile.\n\nIt was about 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  There were probably 15 other people in the place who were all of Asian decent so you know the place is the real deal.  The ambiance is a bit cafeteria-like but it didn't matter because I was there for a new culinary experience as this was my first time eating Korean food.\n\nNow about the food....\n\nAfter they take your drink and food orders, your table is given 6 or 7 small appetizers.  I don't remember what everything was but I do remember the kimchi.  I've never had it before but I know it is a Korean dining staple so I gave it a shot.  I was not a fan of it and probably won't ever have it again, but it was interesting to say the least.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\n* Mushroom Soon Tofu soup with beef - the soup is what this place seems to be known for judging by the Yelp reviews so I had to order it.  The bowl came out boiling hot which was good because we opted for the raw egg to be cracked and put into it right before it was served.  The soft tofu was a bit different to me but the soup had good flavor and a nice kick.  I would order it again but I'd like to try other ingredients such as prawns, etc.\n\n* Short ribs - this is secretly why I wanted to come here.  I was told they were awesome and they were.  The marinate\\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.\n\n* BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\\marinade was not too strong.\n\n* Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the \"crazy\" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.  I'm not sure I would order this again.\n\nAnyway, I would definitely come back again.  I enjoyed the service and would like to try other tofu soups and some of the other meat dishes.  I really want to try the bbq ribeye and bbq pork dishes in addition to more of that chicken and those short ribs!
1 ||| First impression: ohmygosh it smells so good!\n\nAfter that though, I wasn't very impressed. The food was good, but they were out of several options on the buffet, some of the foods were clearly not freshly prepared, and I didn't get the impression that cleanliness mattered much to them.\n\nWe tried really  hard to like David's, but I can't give more than two stars.
0 ||| If I can give them negative stars I would!  My car was hit while it was parked and they won't pay for my car to get fixed.\n\nChubbs has been the worst insurance I have ever dealt with AND if you ever get hit by anyone from Chubbs Insurance please do the following:\n\n1.  Call the COPS - No matter how nice they are, call them and make them come to the scene of the accident to write the police report.\n2.  Make sure you get all the driver's information, vehicle that hit you (plate, vin and what type of car) and copy of insurance card to prove they are even insured with this company. - If they don't have insurance card with them, tell the Police Officer.\n3. Take tons of pictures\n4. Last but not least, don't be nice - Chubbs won't so don't feel bad if you aren't nice.\n\nTheir Customer Service doesn't even know what they are doing, you get different answers every day.  Most of the reps there have been rude and unwilling to help if you have to file a claim against their client.  \n\nWhen I called in and informed them of the situation, they told me that the person that hit me wasn't even insured with Chubbs, I had 2 representatives that told me that AND a supervisor telling me that driver wasn't insured with them.  They informed that they had the parents, but not the driver.  The next day, the adjuster called me and said that the driver was insured, when I asked about why I was informed driver not insured, the Adjuster got angry and didn't want me to ask her anymore questions about it.  Which makes me believe something fishy about this insurance company - did they add him retroactively after he had the accident?\n\nCurrently still dealing with them and they STILL will not pay for the full damages to my car or get me a rental at the time being. \n\nThis insurance company covers the rich and wealthy, so if you are not that and someone from this insurance hits you then get ready for a battle.
3 ||| Rarely, if ever, disappointed in this Chili's.\n\nGood food, fast service, and everything you expect from this well-known chain.  Never too crowded and rarely a wait, ever.\n\nI take off one whole star because it is FREEZING in this place and not just one time.  Every time I eat here, I freeze.  I and friends on several occasions have gone to our cars and gotten sweaters and coats.\n\nAlso, the partner servers are kind of silly.  Just give me one person so that they will actually remember what I asked for.  It makes it a super causal dining experience having multiple waiters.\n\nLast night, had a delicious Raspberry Presidente Margarita and they left the shaker with quite a large drink..... all for under $8.  I'm sold by that.
4 ||| I hate going to mechanics!! However, Bumper to Bumper was recommended to me by a friend and I've had only good experiences there. I took my car in for a basic repair that only cost me $25, but I expected to pay around $100 for it. I'm glad they were honest and didn't try to upsell me anything...they just fixed what was wrong and did it as inexpensively as possible. Highly recommended!
2 ||| I have been having a tragic time trying to find SoCal style Mexican food here in Vegas.  There are Roberto's, but not only was the Roberto's franchise not my first choice in San Diego (there are so many better taco shops), it's hit and miss here in Vegas -- each one is a little different and all are just slightly different than the ones in San Diego.\n\nIn my quest to find something like I'm used to, I read that Pepe's was much like SoCal -- and it sort of is.  It's not the same, but I think nothing will be the same as actually being there, so I just need to judge based on what I got.\n\nI ordered the carnitas and I have to say, I was super unimpressed. The meat was bland and fatty and didn't have that salty crispness that carnitas have.  The tortillas were good, though, as were the rice and beans.\n\nMy boyfriend got the enchiladas and he's super picky about food, especially enchilada sauce, but he really loved them, so that bumps it up from 2 stars to 3 for me. Finally, enchiladas he likes.  He wasn't wild about the chorizo burrito he got another time, though.\n\nThe service was fine, albeit a little chilly in the \"never been before/what a gringo\" department, but adequate.\n\nI will never understand why Nevada taco shops don't offer chips and salsa. People look at us like we're crazy whenever we ask for chips and salsa to go.  No place I've been here even HAS salsa, just hot sauce. I find it so strange.  They did offer chips, though.\n\nI'd go back, but I'd likely just order tacos or a simple bean burrito. It didn't wow me.  But then, I'm just a gringo who grew up a stone's throw from the border, so what do I know? ;)
3 ||| I fly through here a couple of times a year.  On my return flight, I always have a fairly long layover of 4 to 6 hours.  Flights have generally always been good.  The general terminal area is pretty comfortable for spending time in.  A lot of interesting shops to check out.  Plus, the location is convenient if you have time to spend running around town - Phoenix or Tempe...some neat places to visit.\n\nI must say, this airport has to have THE LAZIEST maintenance workers.  I have never seen so many slackers loafing around, sitting on their buts in different parts of the airport, sitting on their carts, or driving each other around.  And the place is DIRTY - it's not like there isn't work for them to do.  Especially in this economy....wow.\n\nSecurity has always been good for me, lines move pretty quick, TSA people are friendly.  no complaints there.\n\nThey could really do for replacements of all the obviously fake plants in the waiting area - those have to be some of the tackiest planters I have ever seen...
2 ||| This was one of my favorite places to go when I was growing up.  We tried it recently because of my fond memories of it but it was just OK.  The steak was very high priced & I ordered the filet mignon.  It was tough & very fatty.  I ordered it medium, it was well done.  The drinks were weak & the service was slow even though it was a slow  night.  Too bad it wasn't as good as I remembered.  Glad its still there though.
3 ||| I had high hopes for this place.  After reading the yelp reviews and online menu, I made a reservation for 4 for Friday night (3/11/2011).  My party was initially impressed with the lovely (man-made) lake view and the talented jazz guitarist/vocalist.  Unfortunately, our initial impression was marred by several factors:\n\n1) we had a long wait for our dinner (45 min)\n2) my order was incorrect\n3) our blonde server was not really attentive (she did not ask us how our food was....she didn't ask if we wanted coffee or tea with our dessert order!)\n\nOn the plus side, the view is lovely.  My meal was complimentary due to the kitchen's error.  The food and wine were wonderful.  I would come here again to see if the service would be better.  For a first-time visit, however, this was a little disappointing, especially since the prices are on the expensive side.  Aren't pricier restaurants supposed to ensure quality of food AND service?  March\u00e9 Bacchus has a lot of potential for consistent 5-star ratings....y'all have the food, wine, and view part down....now, work on your wait staff!
0 ||| Staff sucks! Dislike this store alot. Long lines. Unhelpful staff! I prefer oreilys!
1 ||| I've been here many times because I work nearby, and this is the only reason I'll go back (if I'm with a group). It's an ok place if you want a regular salad for lunch (beware: house dressing just tastes like oil), but other things I've ordered have been disappointing. I had the saith/couscous dish today, and the fish had no flavor and it was really greasy (almost sent it back and I've done that 2-3 times in my whole life). Other dishes I've had have been similar. My glass and fork had caked on food. Today's lunch experience (which took 2 hours on a workday) prompted me to finally write about Biaggi's. For the prices and the image it projects, it's just not a good place.
0 ||| A Friday night; 1st visit; as we were told, place was packed and loud. Okay, we're prepared for it: yelling to be heard sucks, but we were forewarned. Also told that the place was \"typical bar food\".  Hmmmmm.\n\nPROS: we were seated relatively quickly;  pretty decent beer; server was friendly and took satisfactory care of our table of 8; entire staff seemed like an organized, hard working team\n\nCONS: the food. I understand bar food is not haute cuisine, but 4 Peaks was just blah. Pizza undercooked--literally, dough was still moist in parts. Worse? You could tell just by looking at the pizza it needed 5 more minutes in the oven--why even serve it? Next issue: change the fry oil! Over half our table got something of the fried variety (I really hate bar food). In every case, the fried food had that really dark brown quality, indicating the fryer oil should have been changed after the lunch rush earlier that day! After I sent the pizza back and waived off the offer for a new one or another meal selection, I accepted a chicken strip from a table mate. It tasted as gross as it looked. \n\nI understand why some folks like places like 4 Peaks, but I have yet to find a brew pub anywhere in which I've said, \"I have to return here soon!\" True, the beer was okay (I was drinking one of their IPAs), and I appreciated the hard working staff (BTW, server and manager came to table to apologize for the pizza I sent back AND comped us a pitcher of beer). I accepted the noise and the need to nearly yell to communicate, but I didn't like it.  But at the end of the day, the real issue was the quality of the food--poor to marginal.  I won't return.\n\nCheers!\nRS
0 ||| The order was taken correctly but the person at last window gave me the wrong item. No time to back for them to fix a mistake...
3 ||| My first and only visit thus far was many, many moons ago as part of a large meetup group.  Many of us started to gather outside around 7p.  I arrived a little earlier since I planned on trying some BBQ at the stand located outside the venue.  The meat sampler I had was tasty, and it was easier to turn down the cornbread since it looked rather dry.  Instead, I said hello to a beautiful slice of peach cobbler :D  While I cannot eat raw peaches anymore (a pity really, since I only started eating fresh, not canned, peaches around 2 or 3 years ago and LOVE them!), I've found that cooked peaches are safer for me, which I am thankful for.  I recall thinking that the cobbler was good.  \n\nMusicians started to set up around 8, and the first band began playing at 9p.  I enjoyed the many bands that performed that night.  The acoustics of the room was very good considering the venue's history.  I did notice that the crowd here was an amalgam of various age groups, and everyone did seem to be having a lot of fun.  One downside I found was how busy the bar was, esp. since all I wanted was ice water.  Perhaps someone should install a bottled water vending machine.
0 ||| Lots of paperwork to fill out on the first visit (maybe 5-6 pages), then I got hit up with a co-pay, then they sent a bill for $5! Presumably because they changed me the wrong amount in the office.  Then they called me and told me they didn't take the insurance that they took when I was there.  On my fist visit they put me with a PA not a doctor.  It is not ideal to see the doctor on the initial visit to a new \"Doctors\" office. The P.A. told me I had to come back after fasting for a second checkup and then come back again to discuss the blood test results.  Keep in mind this was just a checkup. To my knowledge they just wanted me to get hit up with multiple visit charges.  \nNice crap on the walls and fountains in the lobby does not equate to good healthcare.\nThe old \"stake and sizzle\" deal
4 ||| The Capastrami was awesome! One of the best subs that I have had in a long time. Very nice staff and clean restaurant. Very fulfilling.
3 ||| I've found a new favorite Greek eatery in the Northwest Valley.\n\nFresh ingredients prepared as you wait truly deliver.  The decidedly un-ranch dressing tzatziki (hooray!) has just the right zing.  The lemon juice squeezed over the taboule gave the perfect finish.  And the shawarma... delicious.  For sandwiches, go for the larger \"wrap\" over the \"pita\" and take the leftovers to go; the tandoori-ed wrap _is_ that much better.\n\nMy eyes tend to be larger than my stomach, so I venture just beyond that 1$ mark; but there are certainly plenty of options within that price range.\n\nBe prepared for crowds.  There isn't much seating room inside or out; I missed some table opportunities on my last visit and had to \"borrow\" a table outside from the establishment next door.  Regardless, I'm already looking forward to trying some more of the menu the next time I'm in the area.
0 ||| Too busy to place a take out order is what i was told by an employee. Update your website and indicate that take out orders are not available. Im glad Ihop was available to take my order
0 ||| This review is only based off of one experience from a non customer. My customer paid me with a 25 dollar check from this credit union, I went here to cash it and they told me they \"have to charge a fee of 10 dollars for non members.\"\nUm, no. You can't honor your own customers checks than you're not a great company.
4 ||| I love to go to lunch at off times when  they are not so busy. This was the case on Friday.  I had a fantastic coupon and the waiter that rang me up said he would even make me a fresh pot of coffee. I did not even have to ask.  The salad was wonderful! I really liked how fresh every thing was. Soup a bit so so,but they even had tacos and they were really good. It was very nice and clean inside. My waiter brought me lots of fresh coffee, i was very happy.
0 ||| Over priced, poor service, poor quality. This is a tourist trap and not worth your time.
0 ||| Poor service and was not impressed by the food. Wait staff didn't seem interested when taking our order. I had breakfast, the eggs were burnt and rubbery and the pancakes has sat under the warmer too long and did not taste fresh. Definitely won't be back here
0 ||| Another of Phoenix New Times Ten Best Tacos in Phoenix.\n\nA MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  Another bare bones establishment that I approached with great expectations. Ordered the recommended Suadero Tacos and they came served in soggy tortillas (unforgiveable to my mind) to begin this less than fabulous experience. Very little taste to the Tacos so I found myself pouring on the hot sauce.\n\nWill NOT return!
0 ||| I had to wait close to 20 mins. Even when they had empty tables! Not just one empty table but many!
4 ||| Prepare to have your taste buds delighted and comforted by a menu made with love and service inspired to please you and your family. \n\nRight as we entered the owner greeted us with a smile and the kind suggestion of a few entrees which sounded amazing. The Monte Cristo and chorizo and green chili wrap were delicious.  The Monte Cristo was wonderful, grilled to maintain a even balance of crisp egg and bread along with fresh melted cheese and ham. So soft and delicious to the last bite.  I would strongly recommend this place because of it's loving environment and heathy options made with high quality ingredients.
0 ||| This is a crappy, dark theater that leaks water when it rains. Do not go!
3 ||| Great cupcakes and cookies.  Unfortunately - worst customer service in the world.  It's a shame.  Twice now,  they have goofed up my cupcake order.  No apologies for the mistakes both times.  On one occasion, they completely forgot about the order.  I was told I would just have to buy items out of the case - which I did.  No problem.  However, there were not enough cupcakes to fill the order and I was charged the full order price.  When I pointed out that they had overcharged me by $9, the manager rolled her eyes at me.  Started slamming things around and told me sharply I would have to WAIT for the refund.   So you forget my order, don't apologize, overcharge for the replacement order, then have a hissyfit when I ask for the correct price. Wow. Unbelievable.
0 ||| my girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla and was given a beef quesadilla.  Last time I checked a beef quesadilla would be a taco not a quesadilla.  The shell was overly soggy and nasty. The ground beef had no seasoning or taste.  If this place is suppose to serve mexican food they have definitely missed the mark. Taco Bell does a better job and they are a fast food restaurant. The owner of this place needs to learn how to cook food properly.
2 ||| This is the best fried chicken in town! Whenever I go during lunch, the line extends out the door onto the sidewalk. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because they don't accept credit cards and I wish they'd offer fries instead of tater tots.
1 ||| Let me be the first to say that this place has unappetizing food. \n\nThe pizza slices I've had from here (tried on 3 separate occasions before I decided to write this review) were terrible. The crust was soft soggy because of the grease, the pepperoni and sausage slices were unsavory, and the breadsticks I had were under seasoned.\n\nOverall, it's cheap and fast and that's a big draw for most people, but why would I eat here when I would rather go to the McDonald's on Mills and Regent or any other place that doesn't have grease as a main ingredient for their pizza slices. I'll pass.
4 ||| I friggin' love Trader Joe's. We buy most of our food there, and it makes you wonder, if they can offer such clean healthy food at such reasonable prices, why can't everyone? \n\n A great wine selection, reasonably priced...in some cases half what you'd pay for the same bottle down the street. Lots of organic and semi-organic stuff that isn't crazy expensive, dairy products certified to be rBST free, baked goods with no hydrogenated oils, all that kind of stuff. But it isn't a \"health food store\" it's just a \"good food store\". Great cheese, pasta, olive oil, canned roma tomatos for 1/2 what you pay anywhere else, great fruit, prepared products that are actually really good (like imported frozen asparagus risotto from Italy...that's the shit)...a nice selection of frozen fish, vitamins, beer....\n\nIt's really what every grocery store in America should aspire to. They prove that grocery shopping doesn't have to be a choice between poisonous and expensive.
0 ||| Today's review is a challenge as it's more about the service than the food itself.  If you want the Readers Digest version of the report, skip to the bottom paragraph.  \n\nMom and I went there for dinner.  It was a Saturday night and the outside patio was packed, but it turns out that was a private party, the inside was much more free.  \n\nThe Hostess greeted us with a welcome and asked if we had a reservation.  I asked \"Do we need one?\"  She replied we did not a lead us to a table in the corner near the front window.  We were only a party of two but she sat us at a 4-top, with plenty of twos available.  I guess they were not planning on being busy that night...?\n\nHere's where the poor part of the evening began, with our waitress.  She came to the table without introduction and asked if we wanted drinks.  We did not so she quickly departed allowing us time to peruse the menu.  When she returned, her first words were, \"Have you decided?\"  Biting my tongue for fear of the endless comebacks I could have used, I asked about specials.  She jumped into recall-mode and tried to think about what was being offered, all without pricing or recommendations. \n\nOne of the items was interesting but not enough to make me change my mind on what I was intending on having.  I chose the Lasagna which comes with a soup or salad.  I chose the salad.  There must only be one choice as she did not ask me about my preferences so I have to assume its the only option.  Mom chose the Italian Wedding Soup which on the menu was listed as a single item but the waitress then asked \"Large or Small?\"  Wouldn't \"Cup\" or \"Bowl\" be more appropriate?\n\nThe other thing that chapped my ass about this waitress was the fact that we were there well before 6pm and there are Early Bird Dinner specials offered from 3-6 which she never suggested and looked to be a great value...about 6 separate items all for $9.95 each all of them something would like, too!\n\nA basket of bread was brought out along with some Whipped Garlic & Herb Butter.  The bread was exceptionally dried out and squished as though it was cut when it was too hot and then left to air-dry into something reminiscent of old Scones.  Thank god for the butter, its what made he bread tolerable.  \n\nMy salad arrived along with moms Wedding Soup.  Here is where he marks on this place are salvaged.  The Salad was perfectly proportioned, not too much or little.  The Soup was delicious as well.  OK, I am feeling a little redemption coming on here.  \n\nGetting my plate taken away was slow but a bus person finally came by and removed it.  We also requested at that time a refill of water and some fresh bread.  When it arrived this time, the bread was far better than the left overs served to us 20 minutes earlier.  (Maybe they heard us griping about it and this was their attempt at redeeming themselves) \n\nMy Lasagna finally arrived and this was impressive when first set down on the table.  Large portion, well presented and very tasty.  Lasagna is an interesting food item as its different everywhere you go.  Not always great but usually OK.....This was wonderful!  It was actually such a large portion I took about 1/2 of it home with me.  This, I would order again!\n\nOne thing we notices was the owner and his wife (mother?) walking around and stopping at a few tables.  Based on the conversations we could hear, they were all regulars.  What about us newbie's??  Do we not rate a quick stop to see how things are going??  This is YOUR restaurant and you want to keep the customers coming back, that should include the new guys too, right?  Never happened.  I felt like the red-headed step-child of the restaurant.   \n\nOnce finished, we again had a new delay in getting the plates cleared as well as the waitress to come back by.  She finally did and asked if were interested in dessert but there was no room for me so we asked for the check.  Another delay.  It was delivered, hand written like in an old-school diner.  We left a credit card and again, another delay in getting it picked up.  \n\nFinally she dropped it by the table and said her thank you's....obviously a dinner bill of under $20 was not going to net her a huge tip so there was no need for small talk from her.  \n\nAs we departed the owner and his wife said thank you and good night.  I stopped to ask him what the waitress's name was  who served us.  He mentioned it and asked \"Why, was everything all right?\"  I replied that I was curious as to her name since she never introduced herself and I was just curious as to whom had served us.  Funny, I still cannot remember it since it was only said one time in the whole evening.  Not that it matters now. \n\nThe wrap up...Lousy service, never felt like I was a welcome part of the restaurant BUT great food.  I liked what I had and would certainly try it again....but probably would want to order ahead and get it to go.  The ambiance and setting of home is far nicer than being treated like a outsider at this place.
2 ||| It's really not a bad place to watch a game.  Big TVs, decent beer choices, edible fried foods, nice staff.  With a few changes it could be a 4 star joint. \n\nBut here's the deal:  every time some schmo orders their signature two foot long hotdog  platter called the \"Big Unit\" - a horrifying, shrill, alarm rings off and the staff simultaneously yells the eponymous name.  \n\nWhen I was there, 17 such \"Units\" were purchased in rapid succession.   I watched the rest of the game in fear of another order.  \n\nThanks for the PTSD Alice Cooper!
1 ||| Seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance. That, paired with a mediocre menu and overall experience, gives this two stars. Save your money and stay in town. I would probably send you to the (gasp) Olive Garden before I referred you here.
3 ||| My husband & I met our friends Matt & Brooke here for lunch yesterday afternoon, so we could give them a present since I missed her baby shower the week before. \n\nWe met them there & the salsa/bean dip & chips were already on the table, they also ordered a side of guacamole. This was only my 2nd time here & the boys 1st so we had a hard time deciding. Brooke loves this place so she already knew what she wanted before we got there. We all liked how there were pics of each item on the menu. We finally decided; Nick ordered chicken tacos, Matt ordered a beef chimichanga, Brooke ordered beef & chicken enchiladas & I ordered the Arriba pollo con queso (a specialty item). We all enjoyed our meals, except for Matt. His chimichanga had ground beef in it. I told him he should have got shredded, it's so much better!\n\nService was a bit on the slow side, which seemed odd for the place being practically empty on a Sunday around 3pm. But our server was nice & he always made sure to refill our drinks. Our total (plus tip) came to an even $80, not too bad but a little steep for lunch. \n\nOverall, we'd come back. Curious to try their beer that they brew right there in the restaurant & the desserts looked tasty as well.
4 ||| I was pleasantly surprised by Harper's! I was thinking it'd be like a cross between Chili's and Applebee's...you know, either way, you're not going to be entirely satisfied, and you'll likely walk out of the restaurant feeling worse than when you walked in. But no! \n\nI had the Sicilian pizza, with prosciutto and some other salty tastiness. My sister got the Chicago and had no complaints. The only thing I would ask is for them to put the descriptions of the pizza on the menu. If I hadn't asked the server what came on the Sicilian pizza, I wouldn't have ordered it. Same for the Chicago, which is an even more deceptive name since pizza, when the word \"Chicago\" is involved, has a different meaning. Our server explained very well what all the toppings were, and was attentive to our needs for the most part.\n\nAside from there not being enough information on the menu, my family and I had a nice experience. I'd be happy to come back.
0 ||| Awful service, awful food.\n\nWas here several weeks ago as part of a large group; I arrived partway through the meal and did not order anything, so can't speak for the food on that occasion (though it looked good), but the service was excellent. We had a male waiter who handled our giant group with ease and was very pleasant.\n\nThis time, we had a girl serving us. I did not catch her name, but she was short, kinda squat and had darker hair. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude, and was nowhere to be found when we needed refills, dressing, or the check. Another server also delivered all our beer from the bar, so she must have really been pulling a vanishing act.\n\nAs for the food... We had chicken alfredo and a pizza. The alfredo sauce was ridiculously salty and the noodles undercooked. The pizza was lukewarm when it arrived. The crust was insanely chewy to the point of making your jaw hurt. The only good thing about the meal was the ranch dressing.
2 ||| Not sure what the big deal is, went today because I got trumped by the coworkers I went to lunch with. Don't wanna bash the place too much as the service was good and that I'm not a 'Carolina' style bbq person. Just can't get with all the vinegar and plus the meat was pretty dry.
2 ||| Living Social made me an offer I couldn't refuse...one night in a suite at the Arizona Grand Resort in Phoenix, four passes to their onsite water park, a $50 gift certificate to their onsite spa (ummm...massage!), and two free breakfasts at their onsite restaurant. It was only a tiny bend of the straight line between San Diego and Las Cruces and offered me relaxation and a break from driving...so I bought the deal for the budget pleasing price of $129.\n\nIt was PACKED...a beehive of kids from 0 to 16...and parents who were thrilled to have them distracted long enough so they could sneak off to the onsite spa or the onsite golf course or lounge by one of the 100 onsite pools in peace. I saw many a man gazing lovingly at the Budweiser clutched lovingly in his hands. Both Sophie and I shuddered to imagine the water quality in the pools we dipped our sweaty bodies into. I had a nice massage...not the best I've ever had, not the worst I've ever had. Breakfast was kind of a nightmare...a 45 minute wait with the added torture of staring longingly at several empty tables. Service was always great...\n\nIf you're not into being surrounded by kids, I'd bypass this place...
3 ||| I gave this restaurant three stars because they made some of the best Chinese food take-out I've had in Vegas, but that's not to say it was very good... For some reason Vegas has really terrible Chinese food and I'm usually relieved if I don't get food poisoning from it. In New York and Fort Lauderdale there is some AMAZING Chinese food and the delivery guy will get to you in ten minutes even if it is pouring rain outside. Anyway, if I was grading this place based on all of the Chinese food I've ever had I would give it two stars. If I were grading on a curve (since we are in Vegas) I'd give it about 3 and a half stars. I decided to rate it in the middle as a result.\n\nNow let's breakdown the food: my girlfriend and I ordered the Poo Poo Platter as well as the Kungpow Shrimp and the Broccoli Beef. The Poo Poo Platter consisted of Crab Ragoons that were 90% cream cheese. Meh. The Egg Rolls were good smothered in chili garlic sauce and soy sauce, but they were some of the greasiest things I've ever eaten. Then there was a sweet pork thing on a skewer, not a ton of meat on it and I just wasn't a fan. There was this weird piece of chicken wrapped in tinfoil that seemed like it was baked in soy sauce and it was DELICIOUS. My favorite part of the whole meal. I would eat that again.The shrimp in the Kungpow Shrimp was good, but everything else kind of sucked. There was a ton of waterchesnuts in the Kungpow Shrimp and I hate waterchesnuts, but there was also a ton of undercooked zucchini that gave the dish a really crunchy texture. Ew. Also, the sauce on the kungpow shrimp wasn't even spicy. Maybe they gave me the wrong dish? I don't know. The beef in the broccoli beef was chewy and the sauce was sweet. My girlfriend liked it, but I didn't. I did like the Broccoli Beef better than the Kungpow Shrimp though. Also, the Broccoli Beef didn't heat up well and I didn't even bother to eat the Kungpow Shrimp.\n\nI'm really surprised that this place has such amazing reviews. I may have gotten a crappy meal because I ordered right before they closed, but I asked if that was okay and the woman on the phone said yes. If she had said no it wouldn't have been a problem and I would've just called somewhere else. I am not impressed and I'm not ordering from Golden Flower again. I'll be going out of state for my Chinese food from now on.
1 ||| Ah, the place where dreams go to die. I find most casinos in Arizona to be a little depressing, this was no exception. It's pretty small, but they do offer all the games, including tables, bingo (and late night bingo parties) and keno and it's easily accessible, so it will do on occasion, when I can handle all the smoke for a few hours.
0 ||| Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well, if you're into that, you'll love this joint!!!\n\nThe food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage, which at any other place is a very small pizza, and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).  \n\nDon't be fooled by this \"gourmet\" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.\n\nwhen I compare this to say Oreganos, they are not even in the same ball league.\n\nskip this joint....and save your money.
0 ||| There is almost no reason to go to BWW unless you're jonesing to play NTN trivia.  I used to be a regular here, sometimes coming as often as 3-4 times a week, and I one of their first customers on the day of their grand opening.  But better competition has moved into the Eastern Avenue market and BWW refuses to adapt.  The drinks are cheaper at Inn Zone down the street.  The food is better at Stadium Grille across the street.  The gambling comps are better at Doc Holiday's which has two locations in the area.  Every time I come in one of the four big TV's doesn't work.  And what kind of place doesn't serve you fries with your burger?  You have to order fries separately.  I still stop here periodically (usually when I want to play trivia) but to be honest, there are now better choices in the area.
0 ||| This office has a horrible staff! I made an appointment that took me 5 weeks to get into. And this was only to see the Nurse Practitioner. I arrived at my appointment time, and was told that because I did not arrive 30 min. before my appointment that they could not see me. I was not told to arrive early.  All I needed was a prescription to be refilled. Now they wanted to re-schedule! I waited 5 weeks for the first appointment!  You have got to be kidding me! Office staff were extremely rude, and lied about telling me to be there early.  Seriously how long could it take the nurse to write one prescription!. For some reason this Dr. is not listed w/ the better business bureau either. Hmmmm...
4 ||| I felt like agent Cooper in Twin Peaks as I sat down to sample several slices of pie in one sitting.  I'm twitching as I write this... drooling over the memory of each slice and how amazingly good it tasted.  The blueberry crumb, the peach, the Jack Daniel's pecan.  I left with a whole apple crumb, which later on became 1/3 of an apple crumb pie before nights end.  As their website states, worth the drive from anywhere.... it is.
3 ||| famous for their 24 hour specials. this family diner offers decent breakfasts all made from scratch. prices are reasonable. very busy on sundays there may be a wait. service is a little slow but friendly. lots of booth seating. i'd stay away from the dinner menu-not so good from experience. good breakfast
4 ||| these doughnuts were really good. I had vegan doughnuts and im not vegan and they tasted great. the apple fritter was one of the best i have ever had, especially for being made from vegan ingredients. and also the prices are super cheap! I can't believe how cheap everything was.
0 ||| Where do I start with this?  I am used to the Discount Tire that makes sure their customer is taken care of.  I had a tire blowout on the freeway on a Sunday afternoon.  I towed my car to this shop as it happened to be the nearest one to where my car broke down at.  Being a customer, I knew 2 things.  1, my tire was flat and 2, Discount tire would fix it.  I left my car in their parking lot overnight and called them first thing Monday morning to advise them of the situation.  They said that they would get everything taken care of, that they would be fine only having to replace the one tire, and it would be done that same day.\n\nSo I picked up my car that afternoon, happy as a clam.  One of the employees (Victor?) seemed to be in a rush and while my credit card was giving me problems, he was pressuring me to just use a different form of payment and call my credit card company later.  That wasn't very nice.  Regardless, I was happy to be over the situation and I drove my car home.  \n\nThe next day (today), I got ready for work.  On my way out of the Starbucks parking lot, I notice the same exact wheel that they fixed was yet again, flat.  It had barely enough air in it for me to lug it to the nearest QT and fill it with air.  I then proceeded to the nearest discount tire to that location (4th ave and Bell).  It was then revealed to me that the tire that and the blow out, the same tire that was then again flat, was flat and was having tire issues due to a CRACKED RIM.  \n\nNow.. I am not saying my rims were in perfect condition.  In fact, I knew that they had seen better days.  But words cannot convey how it felt to know that they did not fully inspect my rim as they should have for safety/hazard reasons.  \n\nIf they had only taken an additional 3 minutes.. THREE minutes... to check the rim and see that it was cracked, I would have GLADLY paid for a new set of rims and tires right then and there.  Times like that it is not about money- it is about safety and I TRUSTED them to tell me that my car was or wasnt safe to drive.  They were NEGLIGENT in not checking for my safety and literally, put my life at risk.\n\nI can't imagine what could have happened if I didn't notice the flat this morning and kept driving up the freeway to work.  Another blowout during rush hour?  \n\nThis discount tire put my life at risk and it is my mission to make sure that this gets as far as it can.  This can happen to ANYONE.  I am lucky that I caught it before it was too late.\n\n\nI would not recommend this discount tire to my worst enemy.
4 ||| The most dependable upscale restaurant I know in Phoenix. First-rate dishes, like melt in your mouth osso bucco and a huge and delicious veal chop, at reasonable prices. Reservations essential. Don't miss their calamari.
4 ||| I received a card for this place from a Verizon store when my phone has issues, and i had no insurance. Dan was very quick and repaired my phone for a very nice price! His first fix did not take care of the issue, but after taking it back to him he was able to properly diagnose the issue and resolve it with no extra cost. I would definitely recommend going to see Dan if you have any phone issues.
0 ||| it seems  that latley the food have been hit or miss..no sweets except on sunday and some of the food is either 2 sweet or salty. and the guy on register was slow. the inside has never been redone
2 ||| Went in today during my lunch break for a quick oil change.  Whenever I choose Jiffy Lube, I never really know what I'm going to get.  Some locations are ok, others are pretty darn slow.\n\nI hit this location today, at around 1pm and was on the road in less than a half hour!  It wasn't very busy, but I was very pleased with the service.\n\nThey didn't push on the up-selling, of course they asked, but I liked that there wasn't the high pressure there normally is. \n\nThe two techs were very pleasant, and the manager was very friendly and kind.  They did a good job cleaning the windows/vacuuming as well!  This location is a good 8 miles from work, but I chose it because they had the best reviews of all the Jiffy Lubes in a 10 mile radius. \n\nI will be defintely be coming back to this location!  Great job. Got the speed and convenience I was looking for.
3 ||| On a recent business trip to Madison, I had the opportunity to experience Demonico's.  As it's a rare occasion to hit a nice steak joint, I was definitely excited and eager to get in the door and sample the menu.  We ended up ordering almost every app and a variety of sides, in addition to my main course - the Tenderloin (ordered medium-rare - of course!).  \n\nWhile the ambiance is typical higher-end steak place, i.e. dark, formal, and warm (by the way, this is all good) and the server was great, the food certainly fell short of all my expectations.  The mussels were in a sauce that felt too watered down, the tuna app was average, as were most of the sides.  My steak was over cooked and dry.\n\nJohhny Delmonico's has all the makings of a great restaurant, but it maybe time to look for a better kitchen staff.
0 ||| I walked in and noticed a cashier counting money from the cash register. I asked her for a pie. Without washing her hands from counting dirty dollars and coins, she picks up a pie from a bakers rack full of other pies and places my pie in a pie box. Disgusting.
0 ||| : (\nHubby was craving Carl's burger and we were in this neighborhood, so we ended up here...\nA few odd things...\nHubby had the Western burger and I had the bacon guacamole $6 dll burger... Staff was friendly, food was OK. Mine had a strong flavor, like cumin (I guess I do not like cumin very much) but I didn't know if it came from the guacamole or something else.\n\nMy sweet potato fries (large) were like half. While the container was flat on the tray it looked full, but once I picked it up... I swear, it was almost half...\nHubby had the criss cross ones and that was reasonably full, but the odd thing is that he asked for large but the receipt said medium.\nStraws? They only had short straws by the fountain drinks, which barely stick out of the large cups, like a cm or less... I went and asked if they had long straws and they immediately gave me a couple from behind the counter... o.O\n\nLike some other yelper mentioned, the tables, seats and floor look like greasy... \n\nAaaaand, to top it off, my hubby noticed a bug behind me... and it looked to me like a tiny roach (like 2mm).... : ( those brown ones with a yellow spot...\n\nYuck... please remind me not to stop here ever again... : (
0 ||| I think Rubio's is my least favorite of the quick-service Mexican restaurants. I want to like it, but somehow the flavors just aren't my bag. They do have fish and shrimp here, but again, not really my bag. \n\nOn the day in question I had a salad. It left a little something to be desired--though it was fresh. They make it seem like you're getting buckets full of avocado, and then you get three teeeeeny little slices. \n\nI will say that the service at this place is stellar. Everybody was so friendly, even brought me my food when I cold have gotten up and got it for myself. If I liked the flavors more, I would definitely be giving them more business based on service alone!
0 ||| This place has the smallest selection of womens' bikes I have ever seen for its size, and literally only one or two small women's road and/or hybrid bikes.  If you're under 5'5\", skip this place and go straight to Champaign Cycle, which has lots of small Treks to ride (if you don't like Trek, though, you should drive to Bloomington).  Also, they make no effort to adjust your bike to fit you if you buy it there. I bought an Electra Townie there and paid full price, and only learned later that the handlebars were set WAY too high; I could barely reach them and could never curl my fingers around the handlebars without leaning way forward. Because I could not yet ride a bike when I bought this one, I couldn't test ride, but this was something that anyone could have seen who bothered to look at me and look at this bike.  I later adjusted them myself at home using an Allen wrench, but other adjustments were needed that required tools that i don't own, which was irritating.  Also, the salesperson tried to wheedle me into riding a bike that was so big for me I couldn't stand over it.  I also was sold a water bottle holder for my Townie that didn't fit my Townie.  I was unable to return or exchange it, but they offered to give me some \"shims\" to make it fit.  very lame!
0 ||| If I could give a ZERO, I would.  We had the prime rib last night and it tasted awful!  In fact, it tasted old.  The food is definitely not worth the money.  The only thing good about the experience was the service.  I was with someone that has been going to this restaurant over 30 years and they say they have never tasted such bad food from this place...yes, even their food tasted just average or old.  Perhaps quality control isn't what it used to be?  I think this will be the last time for me.
3 ||| The pros: the ambiance, the food, and the uniqueness of it all.\n\nThe setting is very relaxing and romantic. We had never had fondue before, and found it very entertaining. Our waiter was attentive without being over bearing.\n\nThe cons: the price and it can get pretty busy.\n\nI don't remember our exact total, but I do remember thinking \"holy crap\" when they brought the check. Also make sure to plan ahead. Show up without reservations and you'll end up waiting a while.\n\nOverall the experience was pleasant.
3 ||| Bey good food. The only thing is that it's a little bit pricey for what your getting.
0 ||| Called to schedule a simple 5k, and I got a lot of \"Uhhhhhh's\" and \"Ummmmms\" which is never confidence inspiring from the get go. They were $105 higher than another dealership i wont mention- and wouldnt work with me on that price. He proceeded to tell me theyre not busy at all and could have someone finish it quick. So youre not good at your job, youre expensive, and not busy? Shocking.
0 ||| WORST. HOTEL. EVER.    I don't know if the tower rooms are any better than the courtyard (where we stayed), but the whole experience we had here was awful, from beginning to end:\n1)  The \"resort fee\" literally cost us more than the room itself\n2)  They sell you non-refundable breakfast buffet coupons then don't tell you all the terms and restrictions so you end up wasting your money\n3)  Their \"complimentary internet\" is sporatic and unstable\n4)  The rooms are cramped and there are no bed options bigger than double\n5)  If you are over 5' 5\", you will have to crouch or sit down on the floor of the shower fit to under it....or you will only get clean from the waist down.\n6)  The management and staff are the smarmiest, nastiest samples of humanity you'll ever find.  Watch out for the tall blond manager.  I swear he was one of those creepy evil smiley guys that eat your soul (while grinning from ear to hear with pure hatred) from that episode of \"Buffy.\"
4 ||| Best pozole in town! I go every chance I get. Everyone is extremely hospitable and The chips and salsa are great.
3 ||| Well it was St. Patrick's day and I could not think of anywhere to go but here, that might be celebrating. Oh the were definately into it up in here! haha patrons and staff were both decked out for the day in green and with hats, tee-shirts, plastic jewlery and just about anything you can find related to the day.The crowd was happy and I talked to a lot more people than on the average stop in. The dining room and bar were both filled. The Irish music was filling the place, the green beer was flowing as one might expect at a discounted rate. There was a corn beef & cabbage plate special being offered up as well as the usual menu items and the Wed .40 cent wing deal they now have started. There was St Paddys day decoration and give aways from happy hour into the evening. A fun and lively pub it was. My only complaint was that drinks were all being served in limp little plastic cups; mixed drinks and the beer.
0 ||| This location hates to do returns of their merchandise. Purchased from their online site, had original receipt. Customer service was terrible and they tried to refund less than what I actually paid for the merchandise.  Additionally they made me wait 30 minutes for a manager to try and help me out.
4 ||| Really beautiful 90 minute nature cruise. We went on Sunday morning May 5th. It's a real deal at $20.00 and we had an Entertainment Book Coupon for Buy One Get One Free. Bald Eagle nest with babies & rare Crested Saguaro. Priceless. The captain and crew are great and they have a little snack and drink bar. They play the song \"I Love You Arizona\" and it is really touching. Very fun time - Highly recommended.
2 ||| This is my roommate from China's favorite Chinese restaurant in Oakland. He says they prepare the food like his mother did, but he also mentioned that he doesn't think his mother's cooking is that good. There is a rumor that Szechuan favors Asian students which seems to be true according to my roommate who was able to order meals after hours.\n\nBased on my experiences, the food quality and preparation time were on par with the other American style Chinese restaurants on the corner of Oakland Ave and Forbes. Szechuan is a little cheaper but the entree typically consists of a little less meat.
1 ||| There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  \n\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. \n\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. \n\n\nNow the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. \n\nThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. \n\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  \n\nThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.
0 ||| Well, for the person who wrote the review before me, I guess you haven't met the owner yet. Wait till you meet her.\nIf it were the only place to shop for Asian foods, I would rather go hungry. Lucky for me, there are other Asian grocery stores which have better selections and way better customer service.
0 ||| What a dump.  One star for scenery but thats it.  Drunken morons, stoners, fights, and police.  I also think that \"Girls with Low self-esteem\" was filming there.  Nasty people.  Find something else to do.
3 ||| My first time here, I saw that it was a very homey feeling. Every inch of space in the store was used and did not waste any. An awesome selection of beer that you can't find anywhere else, that was the first place I browsed. I drank the Aventinus which was absolutely delicious (and at 8.2% alc. content it got me where I wanted to be.) The only small problem I feel was that the seating was limited and parking was also limited. I think this only applies to the wintertime because it's too cold to go outside to drink.\n\nI have heard raving reviews and talk about their deli, but sadly when I went there it was closed and I didn't get the chance to go and try their food. They definitely have an amazing amount of beer food where it accompanies your drink. I found that really useful as my friends and I did buy some snacks to eat. I will definitely be back here for their free beer sampling.
2 ||| Service was best part of our meal experience. Pork tenderloin was over cooked, mixed veggies were flavorless, trout was dry and overcooked as was the salmon. Very disappointed as I know they can do better.
2 ||| I had heard good things about the 'dog, and have to say that in general, I was a bit disappointed.\n\nWe happened to be in the area for one reason or another, and so we stopped in for what we hoped would be a quick meal. The menu looked appetizing, and after placing our order, we settled into a nice discussion and waited for things to arrive. And waited. And waited. And waited.\n\nEventually the dishes showed up, which meant we were able to dig into our dishes, and it just led to some disappointment. To be fair, it could have been because of the huge wait. But the dishes really didn't live up to the description on the menu, or to the level we  had been hoping for that was seen by many other reviews. They weren't bad - they just didn't have the kick we were expecting.\n\nOff night? Perhaps - it happens to everyone. We may try again, but since they aren't in our neck of the woods, it might be a while.\n\nOn the upside, the decor was definitely interesting, and because of the service misses, we had plenty of time to look at it.
2 ||| Will buy a grill and some meat and try my own hand before I go back.
1 ||| I hate to do this but My last visit here was horrible which was 45 min ago! Thats how bad it was that i had to yelp it right away... Food was like normal ive been going there for years now. But the service was horrible!!! Not once did we get ask for refills and i drink water like crazy! I asked for the manager and we talked but she seem to be so defenseive lke the owners on Hells Kitchen I couldnt believe it... = [ i hope this service changes around.
4 ||| I like this place...Saw dust on the ground, country music in the back, great views, and a small slide to get you into the restaurant. I went last night with my son. A balloon guy and magician approached our table and made waiting for our food fun. I might normally have been annoyed because I had to tip but, because I had my son I was truly grateful. Free cotton candy with dessert! And quite possibly the best chocolate cake anywhere. Yes, I just said that! It's true!
2 ||| The only reason I wouldn't rate this place any higher than a 3 is that it can be a hit or miss. This time was great! \n\nFOOD: I ordered the chopper steak salad, which is grilled steak on top of a bed of greens with half an avocado, cherry tomatoes, corn, onions and a tortilla. The steak was tender and tasty with the ripe avocado. I had it with Ranch dressing. This combination was a light but filling dinner.
0 ||| RUN AWAY!  Went for brunch mid morning on a Friday, seated in the corner of a back room (sure to be ignored).  After browsing their 10 page, grimey-ass, PrintShop menu still covered with syrup from the 90's on it, and multiple servers/runners/bussers passing me by multiple times for 10 minutes without so much as a check in or glass of water, I peaced out.
2 ||| A bumpy first experience with Modern, but alls well that ends well.  Although you may call a specific location, that location might not be the one that answers the phone, so from the get-go, we had a bit of scheduling confusion.  I had perused the services menu online prior to calling, and had selected the Fresh Face Facial.  As I scheduled my appointment, the receptionist mentioned that it was typically for teenagers, but given that I felt this was best for my needs, she booked it for me anyway, no questions asked.\n\nWhen I showed up, I was pleasantly greeted and quickly ushered back to the waiting room, where I was asked if I wanted anything to drink (from reading other Yelp reviews, apparently they have wine?).  The chairs were comfy, the lighting moodful, and there were a few magazines to read while passing the time.  Once I was called back to my room, it got awkward.  Apparently the service I'd booked was ONLY available for teenagers, although neither the website nor the receptionist indicated this restriction when I booked my appointment.  The aesthetician and I played an awkward cat and mouse game as she tried to upsell me to another facial.  Given that price was one of the factors I'd used in not only selecting my facial choice, but also one of the reasons I'd chosen Modern over another spa, I was a bit peeved.  My face is the same size as a teenager, and I'm breaking out like it's the mid-90s all over again, so I don't see why there should be a $15 upcharge (which she told me was the standard price difference between the Fresh Face Facial for teenagers and the comparable offering for adults).  Finally, she said that since I hadn't been told this during the reservation, they would honor the appointment as scheduled.  Nice outcome, but making your clients uncomfortable from the get-go is not the best customer service experience.\n\nWe began the facial, and I told her I had been having some skin problems over the last few months.  Instead of generally asking me what products I use, she immediately said \"do you use Aveda products?\"  Here, we go - informercial central; time to sell some product.  Luckily that was the only sales push I got, but again - an impact to the customer experience.\n\nOnce we got over those hurdles, it was actually a very pleasant experience.  My aesthetician was easy to talk to, and what she did felt great on my face.  Ultimately, I was pleased with the service (product-related) I received but felt there were some challenges with how the service (customer-focused) was delivered.  Not sure if or when I will return.
2 ||| My first time here was for the Queen's Feast a few weeks back. We try to go somewhere new every time this event rolls around to see if we find any little unexpected gems. Food was pretty good, service was absolutely disappointing, & prices matched the quality of food for the most part. Nothing earth shattering here but it is certainly a decent place to eat on the high end.\n\nWe started with the Arrancini and the Hummus & Dolmada. Both of which were excellent. The Arrancini was really excellent. Could sit around and get fat on that one. Mmmm. \n\nNext we ordered Trout a la Navarra and Chicken Tagine. The menu description of the Chicken Tagine says \"a fiery harrisa sauce\". Yes. It. Is. My husband likes things that set my face on fire and he mentioned it was nearly too fiery for him! This dish, IMO, is over priced by about 5-7 dollars. Other than the price though, he had no complaint (it was Queen's Feast so everything was a flat rate from the offering menu so no bigs). The Trout a la Navarra was very well prepared. The trout cooked, skin on, perfectly. This is a plate I would absolutely order again. There wasn't a trace of it left on my plate when I was done. \n\nWe finished off the meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding and Amaretto Cheesecake. The sticky toffee pudding was absolutely delicious. Nectar of the sugar addicted gods. I can't speak toward the cheesecake because, well, yuck. But the hubs said it was pretty good. He's the cheesecake man, not I.\n\nThe service? Was seriously lacking and well below par for a place of this sort. Yes, it was very busy. Since when did that become and excuse for poor service IN a service based industry?? Our waitress was inattentive, slow, and we clearly had just half of her already fractured attention. Also.......a personality to be rivaled only by moldy driftwood. I get that it was Queen's Feast and there are alot of \"po folk\" out living the good life for half the price so tips are going to be lacking. However, I tip extremely generously when you have earned it, regardless. Do your job, do it well or go home. \n\nAll in all, would eat there again for a special occasion. Some of the dishes are a bit over priced, the food was good, the place itself had a nice vibe, but service left alot to be desired.
3 ||| Now, let me preface this by saying this is not going to be your least costly experience\nShopping, but it will provide you with the most variety of unusual gifts and decorative\nItems.  We come once a year from out of state to shop. We have family here and a sister who used to live near the  store is who introduced me to the Black Lion experience and it has been a love affair ever since.  This store consists of several\nDifferent booths in an old K mart store. One booth may be full of antique purple glass\nBottles and another all sports memorabilia. The selection is wide and varied and could easily take all day to see.   I can't tell you how many times I hear \"That's so \ncute ,where Did you get it\"?to which I reply \"BLACK LION\".
3 ||| It's fine.  I've been here twice in the last week for breakfast because it was convenient.  Had the oatmeal both times.  It was good.  The second time I was brought out granola bits instead of raisins and didn't care for that so had to ask for the raisins.  Iced tea is good and they are nice enough to give you a cup to go.  \n\nBiggest complaint over the two visits was on the second one a family with three young children was sat directly across from us even though the entire restaurant was almost empty.  Made conversation harder and the kids were fussy.  Why would the hostess do that?!?!
4 ||| I would have never knew about this place if my friend hadn't introduced me. My friend Annalisa took my friends and I here since we wanted something cheap and something different than what was on the strip. It is in a little plaza in Chinatown. From the outside, it looked like a typical Vietnamese restaurant, but once I stepped inside it was totally different. It was very spacious and clean. I am very picky when it comes to Vietnamese food and I quite surprised when I came here. It was a little pricey, but the quality of food and the atmosphere made up for it.\n\nMy friends and I were greeted and seated immediately  upon arrival. As we were looking through the menu, I was very indecisive about which item to choose. Everything looked so good! I finally came to a decision and ordered the Hu Tieu. I was content with my decision. The bowl it came in looked very small and deceiving, but as I was working my way through the bowl I could not finish it. The broth was very clear and tasty. It was so appetizing that I kept wanting to eat more but my stomach couldn't hang.
3 ||| I'm a huge quesadilla fan. I'm also a big fan of fresh food. In addition to that, as often as possible I like to be a patron of the small locally held businesses in the area where I live. I like spending my money there because they spend their money here and we all know that's good for the local economy. Okay so here we go.\n\nThis place has a pretty big blue sign on the front of the store. They have a half a dozen or so parking spaces of their own in front. It's nothing to look at but what goes on under the hood is pretty darn special. There is only about 5' x 12' of walking space in front of the counter. Directly in front of you when you walk in the door there are pork rinds, Cabeza, Cow Tongue and a few other traditional Mexican entr\u00e9es nicely seasoned and cooked. In the back behind the counter you can see through an open door, a team of folks working hard and making tortillas. This is what I was here for. Now over to your right they have prepackaged in a few different denominations and sizes fresh tortillas made probably only earlier that day and packaged right there on the spot. I bought myself a dozen 12 inch flour tortillas for $1.98 . . . . I couldn't wait to rip open the package and try one right outside the store (I ended up eating three)  Yummy ! All I can say now is I don't know if I can go back to the ones I used to get at Fry's. If any of you have ever had fresh flower tortillas you already know what I'm talking about. Check it out for yourself!!
0 ||| The kids that work here are extremely unsanitary.. They are rude and just plain don't care.  To be honest I love subway but this store is gross. The owner needs to fire the kids working here. Lets be real, making a sub is not rocket science. The other subway in town is 1000 times better. I'm still pissed that the kids knowningly gave me really old bread that I only discovered when I got home. I had to throw the subs in the trash. I was afraid I would get sick. Punk kids wasted $10 that I work hard for. Never again will I go here.
4 ||| Amazing beer selection. Seriously. Not the crappy flavored microbrews you'll see. Quality man's stuff. The food was very good too. We had burgers: pork, buffalo and sirloin and I got to sample all three. Really good. Wished mine was a little more medium than well.\n\nJust wanted to point out the exceptional service. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the beers and was so nice to us. Especially my daughter.
0 ||| I have been boycotting the Artisan for over a year since they charged me a \"pre-authorization\" fee of $40 for using my debit card to buy a few drinks there without notifying me of such, leading to some economic awkwardness in my personal finances. \n\nBut this review is for a wedding I attended there this weekend.\n\nThere is no question that the decor of the Artisan is legendary.  The theme of the wedding was zombie/fetish so it was the perfect venue.  However, the wedding guests were shocked when the planner approached the bride & groom after the ceremony to try and re-negotiate the contract so they could get more money out of them.  THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE WEDDING WAS IN PROGRESS.\n\nAfter that disgraceful little scene passed we had the reception during which the dinner portion of the evening was so badly handled that I gave up my place at the table because the food was not being served.  It seems the servers didn't know who was having what so the food was probably sitting around in the kitchen.  Many guests who had the steak option have reported they got ill from it.\n\nMy friends threw an awesome wedding in spite of what the Artisan event managers did to try and ruin their special day.  I cannot recommend this venue to anyone who wants to plan a special event.  The staff was completely unprofessional and trying to change the contract DURING the event  was just vicious and heartless.\n\nThe boycott continues.
0 ||| Terrible terrible customer service. I work at a place that orders from Wiggies all the time. Today I tried to place an order for delivery and the woman working at Wiggies sounded very miserable on the phone. But I just ignored her rudeness and replaced it with my cheer and went on ordering. At the end of my order, she said they don't take credit cards when ordering? Sounded strange since most places do and I questioned it \"Really? Most delivery places do.\" She said \"Well we aren't most places.\" I didn't have time to argue b/c I was really hungry so I hung up. The woman had the nerve to call back the office where I work and tell our receptionist she didn't want me to ever order from them again! We were all shocked! Who does that? Turns out she wasn't even the owner - just a rude staff member hurting their business. There was a nice man there when I called back to get the owners name - but he was very busy. He gave me the owners name and said to call at 10:00am tomorrow. I can't wait until the owner hears about this! I watch shows like STAKEOUT on the Food channel and if any professional restaurateur heard about the hideous way she treated a customer, they would fire her immediately. Owners of restaurants really have to be wary of the people they have answering their phones b/c those rude people can do so much damage to a business like in this one instance. There's too much competition out there to have rude and badly-trained staff alienating customers.
3 ||| This airport is my go to airport when I have a layover.  There are tons of places to eat, drink and shop throughout the airport.  It is always clean whenever I arrive.  And this has to have the best people watching out of every airport I've been to.  Just sit back, observe, laugh and let the time fly by.  You won't be disappointed.  \n\nThey have a many rocking chairs throughout the airport and  moving walk ways to help you navigate from one terminal to the next.  Just about every flight seems to be on-time, unlike other airports that i frequent.
2 ||| Hit or miss? maybe...but it was a miss for me.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm not reviewing the bar part of Comet Grill, just the grill part.  My wife and I popped in for lunch the other day.  We have heard raves about the burgers and fries being the best in the Queen City so with that lofty build-up in mind along with a hankering for some great fries we stopped in.  We both love good french fries and I realize that they are not easy to cook properly.  If you are using fresh cut potatoes (frozen fries need not apply) then they absolutely have to be cooked twice to get the crisp exterior that stays crisp and the cooked and fluffy interior that actually tastes like potato.  Single cooked fries are good for a few minutes while they are hot, think 5 guys, but go downhill and get limp and soggy quickly upon cooling.  We ordered cheese fries, along with chicken wings as well as a grilled pimento cheese sandwich with even more of the supposedly award winning fries.  We didn't order burgers because, quite frankly we have never found one in a restaurant as good as our fresh ground home made burgers. \n\nThe fries: they were not good, they came out pretty hot but were not crisp and they went downhill from there.  Oil not hot enough, only one fry and potatoes that may have had too high of a moisture content can all contribute to anemic, limp fries and these were all that and then some.  The cheese was just clumped on and cooled the fries down even faster.  Green onion on top was a nice touch but the fries should have been the hero but they were a zero.  Big disappointment.\n\nChicken wings were well cooked, hot and crisp.  We got the garlic Parmesan cheese flavor and they were OK  flavor wise.  Too much salt but proper frying gets them 3 stars overall.\n\nPimento Cheese Sandwich.  I wanted to like this thing.  I am a huge fan of pimento cheese and this was like nothing I have ever tried.  Strange recipe and I can forgive them that.  but the killer was the smell of the oil on the bread.  The sandwich had been grilled on the flat top or in a pan with some old, rancid smelling and tasting oil.  I let my wife smell it and she recoiled at the first whiff.  The plain fries that came with the sandwich were no better than the others.  Anemic, light in color, soggy, limp, seasoned with what tasted like Lawry's Seasoned salt.\n\nMaybe the beer is good and cold and the live music is hot, but as for me, if these are the best fries Charlotte has to offer, I certainly don;t want to try their burgers.
4 ||| Cheba Hut has my favorite sandwiches in the Valley. Everything here is made with care - the employees never skimp on ingredients or mess up an order. The tables are always clean, the employees are pleasant, and everything from the hilarious decor to the food itself seems to have a friendly aura. They even have Mountain Dew, which thrills my green-blooded boyfriend. :-)\nMy go-to sandwiches are the Griefo (toasted vegetarian with cream cheese) and the Panama Red (chicken Parmesan). The garlic sandwich bread is to die for. I highly recommend this (heh heh) joint!
0 ||| 8 bucks and change for 4 mediocre bagels and some disgusting strawberry cream cheese.. No thanks.. Not again
3 ||| I've eaten here twice now and love the food. The spam musubi and lumpias are great. Their poke isn't the best I've had but still decent and would order it when coming back but i wish it was available at all their locations.\n\nMy only problem is bringing the kids here. While they love the burgers, they wont eat the teriyaki chicken because of the fat and the skin.
0 ||| The incompetence of the employees forces me to question how anything gets shipped at all...
3 ||| For us, Mario's is our favorite delivery pizza choice. \n\nIn our experience, the young girls who take your order have a hard time hearing you over the phone (it's quite loud in the restaurant); but once you get past that, you're good to go.\n\nI despise chains and cheap-o pizza (Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's etc) and love Mario's. It tastes very \"New York\" to me, but is not quite as crispy as a good NYC slice. I recommend Mario's White Pizza, it is delicious. Also recommended in the entree category: the Baked Ziti Sorentina. \n\nHowever - beware of their salads... their Greek salad is a joke for $8.99. It should be more like $5.99 for the size and ingredients.\n\nI definitely think that Mario's a bit overpriced no matter what you get... c'mon $35.00 for two (simple) pizzas? (one medium, one large). It's a bit much. \n\nI don't believe we have ever had any issues with delivery. In our experience it always arrives quickly and is usually still piping hot. \nWe happily pay the $1 or $2 delivery fee - even though we live within walking distance of the \"other Mario's\" in Matthews, in Matthews Festival. \n\nI guess the fact is, in the Charlotte area, we are deprived of really great pizza, especially those places that deliver, so Mario's fits the bill quite nicely. It's not perfect, but it will do for now.\n\n~
3 ||| Thank you for the great cocktail.
0 ||| Stopped by with college friends visiting Madison who insisted on stopping here as a tribute to the 'good old days.'  Already not a huge fan I went along with it, not expecting anything too great.  I was right.  Rude staff, dungeon-like seating areas with horrible lighting and cheesy commercials about Greece playing.  DIRTY floors and tables.  The group consensus after getting our food?  \"What the hell were we thinking?!? Either we had no taste in our college days, or the Parthenon has gone seriously down hill.\"  Overly salty meat, dry and stale pitas, with mushy onions and tomatoes.  Gross.
3 ||| This Bank of America location is just okay. I go here for both personal and merchant banking and it frustrates me that on the lunch hour they only have two bankers windows open. Today I waited for at least fifteen minutes with only one person in line a head of me because all of the merchants were dropping deposits and of course it was taking a very long time to count them through. The banker at the counter was very nice and made nice conversation with me but this location needs to be more efficient.
4 ||| I have somehow come to love this place. I remember the first time I went, I walked in and walked out, and I'm definitely glad I went back.  During the weekends it gets pretty crowded but the line moves pretty quickly. If you are coming with small groups of people you will actually jump in front of large chunks of the line. \n\nThey serve pretty good coffee; I really like their cappuccino (second in Madison in my mind only to Graze right now), their omelettes and french toast. I tend to not stray from those items ;) \n\nI'm not usually in Madison during the weekday but apparently their weekday prices are ridiculously cheap.
4 ||| The sushi at Kiku is the best you can find around, IMO. The service is always great too. \nThe restaurant is lacking in style and lighting, but who cares if the food rocks.
3 ||| We were down the street and wanted to grab a bite somewhere new. As soon as we got there, there was a bit of confusion because the hostess was not present. When she finally showed up we told her that we wanted to sit outside and she directed us to a table that had not yet been clean and told us to sit while someone came over to clean it up. Eventually she took on the duty, but never introduced herself or asked us if we had ever dined there before. Khris and I looked at each other and just shrugged our shoulders and made nothing of it.\n\nLater our waitress arrived and took our drink orders, but a pattern emerged as she also failed to tell us her name or greet is in a kind manner. When she came back we ordered our food and both chose the Sweet Cajun Burger which was amazing! The patty was spicy, the sauce was sweet, and Khris enjoy the bread the most. Though thin, the fries were very tasty and were plentiful as well.\n\nWe give the food the highest compliment, but the service was subpar. Given that it's a well known restaurant and a highlight in the downtown area, we expected a bit more.
3 ||| I visited Pin Kaow 2 before and I thought this one would be the same but it is not. The food was slightly more salty IMO. I like the second location better. Service was decent. \n-Duck Fried Rice : a must get here. The rice and duck were moist and flavorful. \n-Pa Kao - It is a seafood version of Tom Yum. Soup was too sour. \n-Salt and Pepper Soft Shell Crab - it was really good but a bit salty. meant to be a dish to be eaten with rice I guess but we were too full. Spicy alert! There was green chilies in the dish. Beware. \n-Steamed Seabass Bangkok style - my favorite dish!!! the seabass was tender and creamy. The sauce complimented the fish well \n-Mango Salad - it was alright. did not like it with the tofu. \n-Pad Prik King - This dish should be in the sauteed section. Our was beef sauteed with green bean in curry spices. Dry dish. It is not a curry dish with broth/ soup like other curry dishes. Pretty good.
2 ||| I had an iPod dock put into my SUV. Everyone was nice when\nI called to make the appointment and all my questions were answered. My problem came with having to return 2xs for them to get everything right. The first return we made was because the radio wasn't working AT ALL. My dashboard was put back together incorrectly (an oversight to the person who picked it up for me- he's unfamiliar with my car) so now I have to go back again. I wish I could give a better review, but the inconvenience of having to make so many trips back soured the whole experience. \nThe guys that helped me were super super nice to deal with. They apologized both return trips.
2 ||| I came here to have dinner for the first time and although I didn't dislike this place, I didn't love it either.\n\nFood: 3/5 - Broiled stuffed shrimp with rice pilaf and literally two stalks of broccoli. My friends ordered all you can eat crab legs for $50 and they thought the crab was delicious; however, they were a bit soggy and hard to break. I ordered the Captain's Punch for $5 off the happy hour menu and it was pretty good and a plentiful drink for its price. Score. \n\nService: 2.5/5 - Our waitress was nice and mostly attentive; however, she had to ask her manager twice if we were allowed to use the Yelp deal for free dessert, and then to see if my friend could use her concierge gift certificate. The Yelp deal situation was understandable, but when my friend also wanted to use his deal, she brought out the dessert AFTER she found out both deals wouldn't work in the same table. Then, she stated that the concierge gift certificate couldn't be used because she thought it was another offer. A gift certificate is not an offer, Lady. \n\nAs for the dessert, save the calories. We ordered the bananas foster and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both together receive a 3.5/5. The wrap used for the bananas foster was stale but the flavor was okay. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e wasn't bad so I would recommend it.
4 ||| This is one of our favorite places. First, Everything on the menu is to die for. I get my usual, chicken gumbo with a side of brocolli, we have recently been getting our son the catfish sticks, I am not a catfish person, but wow! I help him eat them, if he lets me. ;) I could go on and on about the other fantastic favorites, \nWe get treated so special there which is really nice. It feels like home. And our sons favorite thing is Dino, the music man. He isn't always there, but you can catch him at lunch or in the evenings starting around 6. That's a nice deal considering most place don't start music till 8, that's our kids bedtime.\nI highly recommend this place to anyone!!
4 ||| A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about \"being taken\" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop.
1 ||| What has happened to this place?  This place used to be great and now your wasting your time if you are going to dine in.  Food is still good but service just sucks. The place was dead on a Friday.  3 tables being used.  We order a pizza with 2 drinks and waited over 30 minutes for the pizza.  Our waitress never brought us plates or silverware and we never got a refill on our drinks.  The waitress did try to give us the pizza from another table.  Really 3 tables and you cant remember what pizza a table gets?  I guess she should stay away from the back of the store and playing with her phone. This is the second time we have had such terrible service from this place.  We miss you Connie.  We wish you still had the place.  The people that run it now have destroyed this place.
3 ||| This is a small business where you get a good sandwich for a good price. The quality of the meat leaves something to be desired, but overall for a quick bite for cheap it is a good alternative to subway. These are sandwiches you can make yourself, but don't because your lazy. The owner is a good guy who offered to wrap our leftovers for us, so they get bumped up to 4 stars for that. Go here if you want subway but not subway.
3 ||| Love this place.  Great prices and Atmosphere.  Apple is amazing with designs!
1 ||| Wow you are at their mercy. Waiting 3 hours from check in to even be seen for preoperative.  No communication just told this is the way it is.... so far not impressed.
1 ||| The wings were just fine, but the restaurant seemed dirty.  The floor was sticky, the tables had not been cleaned, and the whole place smelled like stale beer.  I wasn't looking for fine dining, but I was looking for a place that looks like it passed it's health inspection.  I don't think I will be returning on my next trip.
0 ||| I have been to this bar for happy hour a couple of times after work. They have good Martini specials and they are tasty too! Everything sounds great up to here. So you must be thinking \" why would I give this place only 1 Star?\" \nHere is where I draw the line_____________________________- \nI went last Friday Feb 6th, now when we go for happy hour on Friday night I come straight from work. Since Fridays at my work are casual, I had my casual clothes on (jeans, button up shirt, DC shoes) Myself and about 10 other people were waiting in line to get in, when I got up to the front, I was turned away because, and I quote \" You can't wear those type of shoes in here\" He then informed me that \"Skater shoes aren't allowed\". \nI asked what kind of shoes are allowed? he said anything but \"skater shoes\" So I said if I had flip flops on that would be ok? he said \"yep\". So we peaced out of there and I'm never going back. \n\nThe End
0 ||| I love Michaels as a brand.  I enjoy crafting, new hobbies, and everything Michaels is about... I could spend my life savings in there without much of a thought.  I worked at a Michaels for two years (mind you, my feelings of shopping at Michaels are independent from my feelings of working for them) so I'm intimately familiar with corporate standards and what the employees are up against.  This store FAILS.  \n\nCustomer service: I've rarely so much as been greeted by an employee here.  When I seek someone out, they act like it's an inconvenience for them to stop what they're doing and answer my question.. or God-forbid, walk with me to another section.  If a second cashier is called up for the always-way-too-long checkout lines, they too act like it's such an inconvenience.  I saw a woman with \"assistant manager\" on her name tag walk right by me, standing in the back of a 10-person, impatient line, without stopping to help, calling for other help, saying a word to anybody, or even making eye-contact.  Ignoring us doesn't make us go away.  \n\nStore cleanliness: There are consistently shipping boxes from incoming merchandise, overstock boxes, and extra product stacked in the aisles.  The same boxes stacked on top of the aisles is more out of the way, but still tacky.  Every retail store has to deal with customers putting things down in the wrong spot, even the wrong department, and routinely go through putting things back... that doesn't happen here, at least not often.  \n\nFraming department: I had a poster that I am VERY fond of framed here.  Again, working at Michaels I was trained in the framing department, so I know their standards.  To start, the frame samples are kept behind a counter, so I expected the associate to help me identify which ones I wanted to see.  She would bring out only the ones I specified, one at a time, as I asked for them... no advice, suggested alternatives if one didn't work, or opinions in any way.  No price guidance, no aesthetic guidance, no questions about what I was looking for, not even a trace of up-selling, and frankly no help.  I made my decisions somehow, and left it for the 10 days it would take.  When I came to pick it up, there was some of the poster \"fine print\" (copyright info I think) half visible, half cut off by the frame.  When I asked about it, they said they had been trying to center the print, and that's how it had to be.  No, no...first of all, it still wasn't centered, so that's no excuse.  Secondly, that's a big problem, not collateral damage they should have been ok with.  Shouldn't they strive for perfection when I'm paying a lot of money for professional framing?  They agreed to re-frame it (another week) and it was positioned correctly the next time.  The last problem was evident after I got it home.  The poster, which was purchased rolled up, had small creases in it over the entire surface from having been rolled so long.  In my frame shop, it wasn't even questioned if a poster would be dry-mounted, it just was.  That would have smoothed out the poster since it is essentially adhering the poster to a piece of foam-board.  If they didn't want to include that automatically, fine, but they should have offered.  These framing \"experts\" should have known what would happen without it and suggested a solution.  I'd have paid extra to have it done, I obviously was willing to pay to have the whole project done well.  These framers didn't take my project seriously; I mean it was a small job (relatively cheap compared to other custom frames), and a reproduced poster as opposed to original art.  Why should they exert effort into that?\n\nThe ONE exception to this review is ONE employee I saw a couple times, who went out of her way to help me.  She came to ME to ask if she could help, she was friendly, and she offered her help as a cashier when they got backed up from having only one register open.  She was on the replenishment crew, so customer interaction isn't even her usual job.  Unfortunately, everything else about this store has convinced me to stop shopping there and drive the extra ten minutes to Tempe Marketplace.  This store needs a serious corporate overhaul.
1 ||| A friend of mine decided to pay 20.00 and get a lifetime membership to REI in order to take advantage of their REI Yard sale they have once a year where you can get gear 30-70% off retail price. \n\nSounded like a deal so I signed up as well. \n\nDay of the yard sale there was a huge line waiting to be let into the \"Yard Sale Area\" which consisted of about 12 tables full of items and they would come refill them occasionally. However, if you were not one of the first 10 people in or you weren't interested in used shoes you were out of luck.\n\nThe first 10 people in took the giant camping packs and scooped up ALL of the camping gear into it whether they needed it or not, it was a free for all with people packed in like sardines. I found an air mattress that may or may not have a leak I have yet to test this, however that is what the tag said.\n\nAfter staying in the sardine can for about an hour I finally decided to take my air mattress inside, they have camping gear during the sale, so they must have killer gear inside.\n\nI go inside and the sticker prices were astronomically high. I am sure you are getting good quality items but for someone who goes camping maybe once or twice a year I could not bring myself to pay full retail on the items they were asking for. I would rather go to Kmart or target and get what I need, heck even Cabella's has better deals.\n\nI hear that the Paradise Valley location handles their Yard Sale differently and takes in groups at a time. Since I have the lifetime membership I will scope it out at least once. \n\nAll in all unless you are going to be back packing all over Europe or living in the wilderness, go find your gear some place cheaper.
1 ||| Their prices have really gone up. Food isn't anything special! Typical westernized \"Asian\" food. I use to come here 7 years ago and have come by now and then. It's alright.
3 ||| My husband and I frequent this location quite a lot as it's fast and really close to home. Good points: like I said already, it's fast and the employees are generally really good. My major complaint here is that nearly every time we come here lately (it's generally around 5pm) they're out of items. Usually the items they're out of are cheese, provolone typically, spinach among others. Now to me this seems like the owner is being a little too cheap for a fairly busy location. It really needs to be well stocked and they're just not :(
4 ||| Top Tier Thai.  Best Green Curry in the city.\n\nWe've been there twice, once for lunch, and once for dinner.  Both were great, with nice service, and excellent food.  \n\nThe big hit the first time was the Tofu Green Curry.  Every restaurant in the city that has a \"Vegetarian Option\" on the menu needs to go here and try this dish.  It is so good, with each ingredient having its own place in the dish.  Not just a mash of veggies in a thick green curry.  Truly one of the best curries I've ever had.  It makes a dish that has become boring in most other places truly exciting.  We had it again the second time and it was exceptional again.\n\nOur second dish was a whole spicy fish, which was also very good, and a nice compliment to the curry.  First time, at lunch, I think I had a shrimp prik pow, and that was also very nice.\n\nThe Ginger Tea is also great.  \n\nAs we were finishing dinner last time, I commented that the curry is so good that next time we'd have to try the Pad Thai.  That's a dish we hardly ever get when its just the two of us, because it can be a bit generic, a safe choice for those that don't know or really like Thai food.  But it IS the national dish of a truly world-class cuisine, and given what they do with the green curry, we thought, \"I bet it's really something special\"\n\nAs we were leaving, the owner thanked us for coming, and as we discussed the meal a bit she said \"Oh, you have to try the Pad Thai!  The best in the city!\"  I bet that's true, and can't wait to have another dish that's usually a bit of a yawn, turn out to be a real surprise in the hands of this great Thai restaurant.
1 ||| We went to Long Animal Hospital for a couple of years and had to stop going over a series of really bad encounters and mishaps. \n\nThey are a well-established clinic in a good location; however, it is a bit run-down and you'll definitely see rusting, paint chipping and questionable cleanliness if you go often enough. We haven't been there in a few years, however, Dr. Killough, Sr stands out as a vet we would never go to again after the very rough handling we experienced with our older, very sweet and gentle, greyhound. He treated her like she was a truck on an assembly line and after that visit alone, she started getting panic attacks everytime we would go thereafter (it was her first time seeing Dr. Killough, Sr after going to the practice for over 3 years). \n\nSecond, they \"forgot\" to give her a Bordatella vaccination (for over 3 years) even though we saw them regularly, we had her original paperwork/vaccination schedule sent when we first got her and they did her vaccinations each year. We were going on a weekend trip and keeping her at a boarding facility, had their vaccinations sent over and the facility promptly called us to tell us she didn't have her Bordatella - kind of important.\n\nThird, they prescribed incorrect dosages to our 2nd greyhound who had heart issues. In fact, they diagnosed him with all his heart issues and kept putting him on different meds - each time we would go in, their diagnosis would change (his heart murmur went from a grade 2 to a grade 6, then to a 5) - he had high blood pressure, then he didn't, then he did again. He had an enlarged heart, then it was normal (ex-racers are naturally larger) and then it was again. Get the picture? We took him to NCSU vet school and they said it was around a grade 4 and that his medication strengths were all off. They sent all the results and paperwork back to Long's. I am guessing they didn't read it, because our next visit to Long's, they re-upped his medications (he was on 3 different medications). He started having kidney issues (and what dog wouldn't on all those meds?) and the prescription bottle dosage changed *again* -- I called them and they had no idea what dosage he was on, or what he should be on or why this bottle was different than the last. I asked them to review what NCSU sent over, which they did, and I had to go back, again, to get his \"true\" medications and dosages. What a mess. We later took him to a canine cardiologist in Charlotte (she had just started practicing here) and she was appalled at all the changes in his diagnoses, medications and dosages. His health definitely suffered as a result of inadequate care and he died, of heart failure, when he was barely 8 years old. Long's just wasn't capable of treating his condition.\n\nBy the time we were forced to leave, both our dogs were having panic attacks when going there (something they didn't have at first, and didn't have at the next vet clinic we went to). We didn't have a regular vet, we saw all of them there and perhaps that is why they never seemed to know what the heck had gone on with our dogs before that visit (we ended up having to tell them our dogs' histories, which sucks, since THEY had their records). Maybe they were too busy to read charts, maybe we got them on bad days, I don't know - but I believe a vet should at least skim an animal's record before walking in and seeing them again. Why should I have to tell you what meds my dog is on? Why should I have to tell them what they diagnosed last time? \n\nFinally, we never used them for boarding, but the boarding conditions are insanely bad. They are outdoor cages attached to the main clinic building. Dogs were completely exposed to the elements AND to anyone walking to the backside of the clinic. Perhaps they've upgraded in the last couple years, but even if they have, I find it pretty bothersome that dogs would sit in a cage in winter, the dead of summer, through rainstorms and potentially have some random person do something to them because they are in outdoor cages. I could never understand how anyone could leave their dog in those conditions.\n\nWe didn't try them one time, have one bad experience, and leave - we went there for over three years and it was one headache after another. I will say that the front office staff were all incredibly nice. They knew our dogs by name within a visit or two and were very welcoming when we came. We also had some good experiences with the vets there, which is why we went there for so long -- but the bad experiences, in the end, outweighed the good and we left. We aren't looking for anything fancy-schmancy (as another reviewer mentioned) - but we expect them to know what's going on with our dogs, diagnose them correctly, give them correct meds with correct doses, have a clean practice and humane boarding conditions -- oh, and maybe be gentle with the animals when necessary. Is that too much to ask?
2 ||| I was here for a conference and it had it's pros and cons. I was in a Jr King Suit and was disappointed that the bathroom was super small. The furniture was low quality. No microwave.  Wi-Fi cost per day which is just un-real these days and at this price point.\n\nIt is really located in a good place next to a mall and close to the interstate.  Room service was really impressive and the food quality was really good.  Very cool pool and common areas.  The front desk wasn't really nice or helpful. They seemed annoyed almost if you asked them something. I asked for a wake up call that never happened, thankfully I woke up on time.  Very comfortable bed. It's phoenix I know but still pretty bad view.\n\nI probably wouldn't stay here again by choice. Hope this helps. Be sure and ask for a room with a big bathroom or shower if you do stay here.
2 ||| Dr. Hull is great but not great enough to overcome the poor treatment from the business office.  Don't ask for anything out of the ordinary like calling in a mail order script.  They are a well oiled machine and you are truly just a number there.
0 ||| My family insists on going to this Chipotle because they like the food.  I go next door to AJ's and buy my food because I would never eat in a place this FILTHY!  Every time I go, same thing.  I complained to management and they don't seem to care.  Doesn't matter what time we go - busy or not, tables are never cleaned, floor has food all over it.  And the bathroom?  Ugh - I won't even go there.  The health dept really needs to pay this place a visit!
3 ||| You know what America needs right now, more economic stimulation and  great chinese food.  Luckily, Wang's Express provides the latter of the two and for an affordable price.  I suggest coming in for the lunch time special from 11 til 4 in the afternoon.  Unlike other fast food places this stuff is made to order.  Definitely, recommend this place if you are in the area.  To Da Roo my amigos
3 ||| This was my first yelp-recommended restaurant in Vegas, and the crowd-sourcing didn't disappoint.  We found it on a mission for vegetarian- and carnivore-friendly Thai, and the 6+ page menu offered something for everyone.\n\nHave had a couple of entrees here that were really good (unfortunately I don't recall exactly what I've had each of the couple of times we've gone now).  The pad thai was fabulous comfort food.  I was told the tofu curry (with heat cranked up to \"10\") was awesome.\n\nMy only complaint about them is that each time we've been there it has taken 30-40 minutes for the food to arrive.  I suppose it's a good sign really, implying that everything is being cooked freshly, but it can make for a really long wait with no food.
2 ||| Went on a date here last night. The food was A+ and so was the lovely pregnant bartender, but our table service was subpar. First, as we headed to the bar, the hostess stopped us and said \"table for 2\" when we were obviously trying to have a drink. Her demeanor was just a little odd. Then, after we had drinks and were seated, we were forgotten about until we flagged someone down and asked if we could get a server (15 minutes?). Then, our meat antipasto came without meat until we asked. Odd experience to say the least.
3 ||| I don't know if \"thrift store\" really describes this unique little chain (there are three stores in the Chicago area, one in Minneapolis, and I wouldn't be surprised if the next one opens in Portland or Seattle).  Ragstock is a fun store to wander through.  They pick up very random lots of overstock, used clothing, and....other stuff, and sell it cheap. There's really nothing expensive here.  It's really hard to walk two feet in this big cluttered three level store without saying, out loud, \"What the..?\"  Well, it's really tight, so it's actually kind of hard to walk two feet in this store, period. I can't quite describe how entertaining it is to shop here, you really need to come with a friend, and a sense of the absurd.  There's lots of absurd in here, and on clearance prices.  \n      So let's see, what have I bought here recently?  A couple of peculiar hats, a black tuxedo shirt (they actually had tuxedo shirts for $15 in 6 different colors other than white, 6 different colors of tuxedo shirts? Yes, six different colors of tuxedo shirts) , a book bag made out of Nepali rice sacks, a used Japanese minor league baseball jersey, some thick union-suit style long underwear (kind of an adult size onesie), a Korean war era gas mask (long story), and a purple bow tie for my cat (who didn't like it and tore it to shreds but it only cost me a buck).  The young, personable and helpful staff, for the most part, actually know what's in this strange store and where to find it, in spite of a constantly shifting inventory.  The staff here are about as unlike the jaded, synthetically friendly oppressed automatons found at big corporate chain retail clothing stores as you'll find, and that alone is refreshing. \n    This is an excellent place for hipsters, those who love irony, people with any kind of sense of humor, tourists visiting Madison, if you need a costume, ska musicians, parents visiting their costly college students (whatever they want in here won't set you back much, and there's lots of conversation starters in here), 50-year olds looking for the sports jacket they wore in 1976, theater people, protesters looking for their rights (you won't find your stolen rights in here, but you can find some cheap gloves and warm hats so you can protest a little longer, and some antique Nixon era ironic buttons that have renewed relevance), and anyone who needs a disguise.  \n    Close to both the campus and the capitol.  Very crowded just before Halloween.
3 ||| Had some penne pesto and added some Italian Sausage.. the pesto was ok.. lacking a little salt and probably need to add a little more basil to the sauce.. but it was good.\n\nThe pizza was better though for sure, but nothing amazing. \n\nEveryone there seems pretty nice and friendly. Will try it again and order something different to see how the rest of the food is.
3 ||| I came here cause one of the stylists, Tamara, needed hair models to complete her stylist training. I was there for color, hair cut and style. I must share that Tamara did a fantastic job with my hair. The most promising part is her passion for the profession and she has fantastic, warm people skills which I hope will not diminish as the year passes. I enjoyed getting to know her a bit while she spent time on my hair. \nI felt listened to when I was telling her my concerns. The hair massage was terrific. She used great products on me. I liked the cut and the style. \nTamara the stylist was terrific. \nThe only part that left me a little unsettled was as I went to leave, she casually mentioned that I had to pay for the products that were used and the receptionist asked if I wanted to leave a tip. \nHmmmm, having to pay for the products used was never mentioned to me in all the correspondences I had with her. I am there to be her hair model to help her become a full stylist and I'm being asked to pay for hair products used and for a tip?\nIn other situations where I've been a hair model, not only was I not asked to pay for anything, I was thanked with a gift bag!  \nI'm sure I would have been okay with it all if I was informed of it from the beginning. It just felt like I was hit with a hidden charge. I paid the $15 and unfortunately left not feeling 100% happy. \nI am sure that is not the intention of Tamara or the salon . . . Although I think and I hope if they reverse the situation, they can understand where I am coming from.
3 ||| I have been here once before today and thought it was OK. \n\nKnowing that have a huge daily special for only $10 I thought it would be perfect to share with my daughter, I think it comes with 5 pieces of assorted sushi fish, a crunchy California roll, crab tempura and a stuffed shrimp egg roll thing plus soup and salad, definitely a lot of food! \n\nThat's what we planned on ordering until we sat down at the sushi bar and saw them pre-making the CA rolls and setting them off to the side on a large tray...UGH you know how I HATE pre made stuff! \n\nI decided on a tuna/avocado roll and Val got a shrimp tempura roll, I also ordered a cucumber salad. \n\nWell I'm much more for quality over quantity and Sakana seems to be the other way around, yeah they give you a lot but it's really not that great. \n\nMy tuna roll was OK, the Shrimp tempura roll was filled with an enormous amount of mayonnaisey Krab meat and my cucumber salad was a giant bowl, probably 3 cucumbers worth, of just plain cucumbers WTH? \n\nI tried to explain to the guy making the sushi but he didn't understand my English because he spoke mainly Spanish and I don't think the waitress understood to clearly either when she returned to me with another bowl of less amount and less fresh cucumbers, plain again but with a drizzle of something foul. \n\nThere is much much better sushi to be had and I'm more than happy to pay for it elsewhere because Sakana's sushi isn't quality sushi to my standards. \n\nBut if your looking to fill up on mediocrity by all means pull up a chair.
3 ||| If you're connecting to a flight in the same terminal, this airport is great!  If you're connecting to a flight on the opposite end of the airport, not so much.  The array of food options will come in super handy when Useless Air - oh, I mean US Air - cancels or delays your flight.  Be healthy and have some Jamba Juice and then undo it all at The Chocolate Factory.
3 ||| load up on fresh fruits and veggies here.\n\ntheir seafood is cheap and good!\n\ntry their aqua frescas for refreshment during the hot summer!
0 ||| I WILL NOT eat here ever again!!! I used to love this place great specials, delivery and good chinese food. The last and final time I ordered from here I got my delivery order and found a handful of baby roaches in my chow mein, that was 3 years ago. I have not eaten here since and I never will return
3 ||| Very nice range where you feel safe to shoot. Range masters have great sense of humor but know when to be serious.  Wear your safety glasses from the moment you hit the property as they get  testy if you don't have them on at all times.  Targets are available for a quarter and you can shoot at least up to 200 yards not sure about further than that. Follow the rules, read the rules,  make it easier in yourself and everyone else.
2 ||| Pizzookie. It's the mic drop.
1 ||| My family went to Ted's this weekend. We have been avoiding it because we dislike cash only establishments, unfortunately we can now avoid it because we don't much care for Ted's. \n\nI am from Upstate NY and I definately want to support bringing culturally pleasing (to me) food out to the desert. Knowing Ted's is from \"back home\" (since 1929), this encouraged me to break with our no cash only policy, besides I had to know if their hot dogs were better than the ones I import from Rochester to Arizona a few times a  year. It's expensive to bring Zweigles (since 1880) to Arizona and if there is a local replacement I was ready to find out.\n\nFirst the ordering of our food was confusing. The person on the grill heard the first two items and then started talking to others in line to take their orders and I wasn't done yet. It wasn't like I paused, it was like he just heard all he wanted from me and moved on. I had to interrupt the ordering going on after me and say, Hey! I'm not done yet. This annoyed him, obviously. But I couldn't believe it when I started to order the rest, It didn't seem like he was paying any attention becuase mid sentance he started talking cheese with the people in front of me!  Ahem... we need two white hots, two footlongs, two corn dogs, three medium logenberry's, a chocolate shake and an onion ring please...\n\nNext thing I know we are at the condiment section and the guy is putting stuff on my dogs I haven't even told him yet what I want on them!  Excuse me, I want to put Weber's mustard on that white hot. The grill guy yells over to me, \"We don't use Weber's, if you don't want yellow you can pump out the spicy mustard over by the straw station.\" \n\nThey don't use the mustard they are advertising in the window? They don't have the spicy mustard at their own condiment station? In the meantime the register girl has already totalled my order and my order hasn't even been made yet, so of course it's not correct. I said, it's not all here yet. This puzzled her. I said I am still waiitng for the corn dogs, the drinks , the onion rings and the chocolate shake. She started over and came up with a second total, also wrong. The shake came in a tiny size, they said they are one size only. Who knew.  The register girl screwed up the change as well. Good thing I didn't just swipe a card and get screwed not paying attention.\n\nWe got to the table determined to see if the food was worth the aggravation. Since the toppings were not done right and the onion rings were very undercooked and a gnarled mess I was really hoping the white hot dogs flavor would kick ass. This was my main reason for coming. It was a decent dog, but it was not better than the ones I have shipped in to my house.  Amazingly enough the best tasting of the dogs we bought were the corndogs! What a surprise. But not worth driving out to Ted's and having cash ready for them. As for the shake, it rivaled McDonalds to me and I'd be happier getting a mondo size Chocolate Peanut Butter delight from Lenny's.\n\nSo for atmosphere, service, food and cost it just doesn't rate more than the two stars I gave it. Looks like I haven't found a way to replace my multi year shipment for back east brats, dogs, etc. with a local alternative. Sorry Ted's.
1 ||| I have been coming to this place for over 4 years now but, it has gone down hill as far as service. Summary: the food is fair, the price is good, the service is poor (after 10pm when night shift takes over, multiple times waiting 20 minutes to get a menu when the place is completely dead)... Probably won't be coming back any more considering.
2 ||| This place will satisfy a craving for Thai food, but the aesthetics and practicality of the menu is poorly put together. \n\nI don't doubt that the service is usually better too, but it was clear they were short-staffed for whatever reason the night I went, so the it took longer to order than I would have liked.\n\nI ordered the Kimow, which is a dish I have been looking for on the menus of various Thai restaurants in AZ, but have never been able to find. Needless to say, I was excited! Alas, at the arrival of my food, I was disappointed. It was a small portion for paying 10 dollars, but I will say it was tasty. \n\nIt is starting to get hot now and the evening's cold air was starting to set in, so we sat outside, which was nice. Inside looked clean and the booths are rather private, which is neat. \n\nMy biggest complaint was the layout of the menu itself. This may sound kind of stuck up, but it really made a difference to me. It is kind of scattered looking and the selection, as it is presented, appears small. Plus, the menu doesn't obviously inform the customer that all their specialties and items that say they're made with this or that meat, can actually be replaced with another meat or tofu (if you're vegan or vegetarian like me). \n\nNeedless to say, I always value trying new restaurants, especially of my favorite cuisine. Wild Thaiger, unfortunately, probably won't be one of those places I insist on going to when I go to Phx though. Like I said, it'll satisfy, but it pretty mediocre.
1 ||| I called this Sam's Club to order some sheet cakes on behalf of a friend who is a member and was going to be the one picking up the cakes. The \"ladies\" in the bakery who answered the phone were extremely rude and unhelpful, even when I asked to speak to a manager. I have never in my life encountered such awful customer service. I told them to forget it and that I was going to get cakes through a local grocery store chain... and I did. We will never use Sam's Club again.
3 ||| I so want to like this place. It's in a perfect location, prices are reasonable, food quality is good; but the customer service is bad beyond belief. The people are friendly, but don't seem to understand that servicing the customer is job one. I've waited for 3 or 4 minutes at the counter waiting for someone to take my order. Likewise, I've waited the same time for someone to show up to take my money. Come on guys, it isn't that tough to cross train your employees and have them flex into work stations as people come and go.
3 ||| One of the nicer airports to fly into, out of and thru. This is my home airport but since it is also the largest Hub for US Airways I also have to fly thru during business travel. You walk from furthest points in about 15-minutes if you use the moving walkways and walk at a good steady pace. You have food and if you desire shopping options in all concourses. TSA Precheck at all concourses as well. You will find rocking Chairs in the main food court area as well as the E Concourse. A big item is that you have free WiFi! The biggest downside to the airport is finding enough charging outlets in the airport. It is for this reason that I give it a 4-Star rating instead of a 5-Star.
4 ||| Love this joint. Best breakfast for the buck. BnB Breakfast aNd Beer. Love the staff. Yay tacos.
3 ||| Jonathan is great. He is not much of a conversationalist but he'll do you right. Good haircut, warm shaving cream, hot towel on the fact, and a massage at the end. I had the other guy cut my hair once and the dude hacked me up. I saw him shave a guy once and dude looked like he just at a sloppy ketchup sandwich (bloody in the face). Waiting for Jonathan is definitely worth it.
0 ||| I will never step foot in this establishment again. This is my 3rd time here and the service has yet to improve. Waiter/Waitresses are continuously very cold not personable. Moving on the food was below average ( chicken fajita  - blackened tuna salad) tuna was over cooked and the fajita  was thrown together! The waiter could obviously notice the tuna was not prepared as we requested however failed to ever ask if we enjoyed our dish. We feared speaking up about the matter due to the poor service and chances of food contamination.
0 ||| Want friendly service, good prices, safe location? Don't stop,keep going! Located in a strip mall near a smoke shop and a QT many unsavory characters milling around. Recently moved nearby and explained that I like Chinese food and need a go to place for my fix. I ordered the lunch special take-out. Thinking they would like my return business, they would make my order especially robust. WRONG! Upon opening, found egg rolls missing, small scoop of fried rice and lo mien and 2 small pieces of beef with broccoli and as a bonus...all cold and bland. Also missing, fork, napkins, condiments and the traditional fortune cookie. No drink order. Total, almost $9! WOW. No wonder it's always empty of customers. Too bad! :-(
0 ||| Place smells very very musky-mildewy. I should have left when I smelled the place. I ordered their \"house chicken\" - it was basically overcooked fried chicken in a very watered down teriyaki sauce - I ate two bites and asked for the check. Husband ordered beef with broccoli - it was cold. Don't waste your time. Go to Great Wok instead for great take out.
2 ||| The new interior design of the restaurant is great and I have no complaints with the updates. However, it has made this location much more smaller than it already was and you just need to learn to get cozy with your neighbors. \n\nBrixx is a great place to come for lunch and that's about it. It doesn't have anything special on it's menu that really separates it from CPK or like Mellow Mushroom. If you are feeling a late night bite though, they do have a 1/2 special for their appetizers and pizza I believe. \n\nI've never had a bad experience here and I don't mind coming here at all. The pizzas are average and don't really blow me away in regards to quality and serving size. I'm the type of person that wouldn't mind paying a little more to get a lot more. An example would be their barbecue chicken pizza. It's a great little pizza, but lately their chicken and cheese have started to disappear and the price hasn't gone down with it. I could go to Mellow Mushroom and pay a buck more to get a better pie with better quality food and serving sizes.\n\nThe Brixx chain in Charlotte and Lake Norman is a great place for lunch. Just don't take somebody here on a dinner date unless you really want to go home alone.
2 ||| The first experience we had here was amazing.  Had a follow up trip for V-day and I was really unimpressed. All 4 courses that night really failed to impress
1 ||| Okay bagels though a little overpriced. Been to squirrel hill location and Ellsworth location once each. Have consistently had rude customer service. Really turns me off. Won't be going back even though the bagels are okay.
0 ||| I stop by with my car to have the estimate on my bumper and at first they said, they just only going to charge $100 to adjust it. Guess what? The next day when I pick it up, it hasnt been done and it looks like it wasnt even touched. They said I need a new bumper a bumper bar and the whole thing will now cost me $1500.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my car, there is another customer who was yelling at them for not keeping their promise. The guy has hitched a bus across town only to find that his car only in primer and not even painted yet. I am not gonna leave my car here. \n\nI took it somewhere else and get it done the right way. Think again, about leaving your car here.
1 ||| I really, really wanted to like this place. We've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent. The first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio. We really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything. I brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit. This time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food. Again, a really inattentive server. When we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her. 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening. Unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst. I asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left. When we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline. She then came to the table and took our order. 30 seconds later she comes back telling us \"Sorry, you missed the cut-off for happy hour\".....yeah, we missed it because you never came back! Grrrr......We received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)...and waited....and waited. No one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food. When our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to Kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you. Seriously???? It's bad enough that they are cooking with a Fry Daddy but never never tell your customers something like that.  After 40 full minutes we received our appetizers, our wine glasses empty. No, she didn't ask if we wanted another glass. She then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries, that other girl will take care of you. \"That other girl\" never came by....ever. We had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check. I fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no. Not even an apology. So I told them our experience and the manager came over. She said she was happy to take off one appetizer. Great. Except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today. So we waited for our revised bill....and waited....and waited. Are you kidding me? We had to go up to the bar to get the check. It's a nice little wine bar with pretty good food but 3 strikes and you are out. We will not return here. Very unfortunate for us and them.
1 ||| The good:  \nStaff was accomidating.  AC worked well. \n\nThe rest:\nRoom looked \"cleaned\". We were already unpacked and tired when we really noticed the state of the room. I wiped down the surfaces with a washcloth and was discusted at what was picked up.  My wife climed into bed and found that the sheets were dirty. The phone didn't work so I had to walk back to the front desk. Got new sheets & towels. Maintenance replaced the phone.\n\nThe next morning, we found that the water temperature wouldn't stay steady.   The tub floor was stained.  Couldn't get out of the there fast enough.\n\nThe entire place needs a thourough cleaning.
3 ||| They have excellent brunch on weekends, the pancakes are not to be missed.
0 ||| Omg!! Wow! rude. Rude. rude. After a busy long day (which included going to the dentist) I was so excited to sit down and eat my first meal of the day (at 4pm)---I was starving!!! At a table for one, I ordered a squid salad and three rolls. I thought \"hey even I don't finish it, I'll have a few pieces for lunch tomorrow.\" the waitress (older Asian lady) said \"are u going to eat all that?I'm not giving you a to go box\" I was like , are you effin kidding me?!, and replied, \"I'm sure gonna try to!\" to which she argued, \"but you are so thin!\" I thought \"so if I was bigger, it would be ok? Wtf?\"! I had to assure her that I eat a lot and was very hungry. Again, wtf?!\n She said \"well why don't u just get one roll, it's eight pieces.\"\n do not tell your patrons what they should orderr! Ridiculous.\n We comripmised on two rolls, which I ate all of! Thank you! AND I was hungry an hour later without leftovers! I am so disappointed and insulted.
2 ||| Last night at 11:58 i had the biggest pregnancy craving for taco bell, so we went through the drive through not realizing how long they open till...\nThe drive through was still open and a young man took our order. \nEverything was fine until we were given our food with a side of attitude. \n\nThe young man handed the food to us and said \"Thank you SO MUCH for visiting us SO LATE\" and shuts the light off in the drive through...\nHonestly, if I knew that they were closing in like 2 mins, I would not have ordered. I don't want any chance of people spitting in my food... \n\nIm still giving this place a 3 star for letting me order and still giving us a decent togo.  But next time, please do not serve people with a side of attitude.
0 ||| It's almost as if Cucina Tagliani doesn't even exist. Despite its visible location right off the Loop 101 freeway, I've never seen a wait. To some that might be a good thing; in my opinion, if it's too easy it's probably not worth it. And Cucina Tagliani proves that it isn't worth it time and time again. \n\nLets start with first impressions: tacky and unoriginal. The whole interior is decorated to look like some small Italian village or something. Oh gee, I've never seen that look before...Oh, wait isn't that what every Italian place looks like? \n\nThe food is so-so. Nothing special at best, and downright disgusting at worst. They don't even have spaghetti and meatballs. This place fills the Italian restaurant stereotype to a tee, and then they don't offer traditional Italian fare. It just doesn't make sense. \n\nThe service is just terrible. They never have enough people to keep everything running smoothly, and the waitresses are so fake. Working in the food industry myself, I'm not the kind of customer that asks for three sides of ranch after my food is already at the table. But even if you order the simplest items, the waitresses will still treat you like they'd want nothing more than to poke your eyes out with the rolled utensils. \n\nWith this deadly combination it's no wonder Olive Garden has a 45 minute wait at any given time, and Tagliani can't even fill the dining room.
3 ||| They have a great selection here.  I got a new gym bag for $30 and a sweatshirt for $24.  If you're a huge Nike fan, come here!
4 ||| Delicious!! Had chicken, waffles, mac n cheese, greens, and cornbread. I'm stuffed. Excellent friendly service!!
0 ||| I wouldn't recommend the two doctors I saw here, Dr. Ibe and Dr.Mueller. \n\nDr.Ibe is one of the worst doctors i've ever seen in my life. She's quick to diagnose with few considerations of your conditions. Every visit with her leaves me feeling unbelievable that diagnosis is this easy and quick, and therefore always INEFFECTIVE. \n\nShe never diagnosed a problem. Always just prescribed standard medicine and does not do a thorough job or care for her patients. \n\nAvoid at all costs.
3 ||| Going to start this one with 4 Stars because we only had Tapas and didn't have any of the delicious looking entrees. \nWe went there for Happy Hour on a Sunday. What time is Happy Hour on Sunday? How about this; ALL DAY 4-9p!! \nSuch a wonderful waitress that seemed thrilled to be working there and knew the menu in and out. Why? Well because she was Spanish. I haven't been to a Cuban Restaurant before and always assumed Cuban Food was Cuban Sandwiches, well that's Cuban Fast Food. Cuban Cuisine is more like Spanish Food with their own Island Twist! Also very similar to Puerto Rican Food with a slightly different twist as well.\nSome awesome specials on food and drink. We kept it simple with a basic Mojito that was great!!! x3 :-P \nWe ordered some food from the Happy Hour Menu and some of their Tapas off the dinner menu. \nI will list them out for ease of reading. \nSeviche-Basic but good! Loaded with fresh fish and veggies! \nFrituras de Camarones-Think Shrimp Cakes/Patties with a great sauce!\nCalamari Frito-Calamari fried in Almond flour, crispy but not caked in batter, really the best Calamari I've ever had! \nCroquetas de Pollo-Delicious crispy little chicken treats with an awesome sauce\nYuca Frita-Great little Yuca fries with another awesome sauce\nPastelito de Picadillo-Great little puff pastries filled with seasoned ground beef\nAlbondigas-Little tender balls of beef with an incredible brown gravy! \nRepollo Relleno-Cabbage Leaves stuffed with Chicken and veggies covered in a creamy lime sauce! \nMojo de Ajo-Warm Garlicky lime and oil that is great for....Well, EVERYTHING to be dipped in! Great for bread dipping!\n\nJust a fantastic experience for us since we loved Tapas Bars in Chicago and ate our way though Puerto Rico for a Week! We will definitely go back for a Full Dinner as our mouths were watering over their Seafood and Pork dishes! Semi-Local place with a nice Island feel as soon as you walk in the door. Also take a look at their schedule for music and dancing as they clearly like to party it up there and make you feel like you're 2000 miles from Phoenix! :-) \nGreat stuff! Thrilled we found this place. Strangely enough because we were sent to a dive bar next door and saw this and knew we needed to go back. \nTake the previous LOW reviews with a grain of salt. I don't like to insult other people but I will guess they're just not up to speed on what Spanish and Island food are all about. This menu was put together like Pros!
3 ||| I love The Funk House. It's a giant treasure cove filled with hidden gems. I've been there dozens of times and have yet to see everything. This is a great place for those who love the adventure of hunting for an antique deal. There are frequent sales and always something new to see. I've purchased a couple of items from this store at very reasonable pricing that I know I will cherish forever. There are definitely notable names and artists with items in this store. It makes me wish I knew more about antiques and interested in learning about them. The Funk House is truly a staple of downtown.
3 ||| Thankfully, a colleague recommended Toscana to me in the clutch and me and my guests had a great time. The service was very good, I managed to get the owner as my waiter and he was just a gem of a guy, sending over comped bruschetta and dessert (must have been my shining personality and mention of how many times i frequent sister restaurant Luce). The food itself was very comparable to what I've had at Luce, although I didnt see the braised octopus that they have at luce (but dont remember really looking). Food was very good, scene was very charlotte (boring) but all in all it was a good time. I would definitely return on a date or a business thing but probably wouldn't eat here alone or with buds.
3 ||| The BF and I went here last night for dinner and it was pretty good. The place is really close to our house, so I'm surprised we hadn't been here before, but we had a living social deal that was on the brink of expiration so we had to go use it! This restaurant is fairly cute inside with adequate seating and a neat looking phone booth thing in the back. I ordered Tom's favorite sandwich or something like that. It had pulled pork with onions, hot peppers, some sauce, amongst other unidentifiable foods. I thought the sandwich was tasty, but the bread was really wet and the whole thing was falling apart. The BF got a bbq pork sandwich and it was good, not the most flavorful sandwich in the universe, but not bad. Despite this not being the most exciting place to eat, I will definitely be back because it is close to my house and they have vienna beef hotdogs (which is what I'm totally getting next time....yum!).
1 ||| Not worth the wait. Save your time and money and go elsewhere fellow yelpers. I'm sorely disappointed by the hamachi tar tar, kimchi fried rice, wasabi octopus,... The tartar was a total rip, two stacks of fried wonton chips with a small layer of \"hamachi\" and salsa. I can make better kimchi fried rice and I've only cooked that dish once. The only dishes we appreciated was the hamachi sashimi, miso cod and chicken skewer. Not worth the time and money, even if I was hungry at 2am. The honey toast everyone was raving about is also $8. Overall, Highly overrated  - your foodie sf yelper.
2 ||| I really like the food here, but consistently the service is atrocious. The servers are rude from the get go as if you are bothering them by just being there. Several examples: the restaurant only had two other couples seated, so when a friend popped in and we asked if we could get a 5th chair for the table, we were told a manager would have to approve it (this took several minutes as the manager was out smoking). My boyfriend and I both ordered bloody Mary's at brunch, but I was brought a tequila sunrise. As someone with lots of experience in the service industry, I immediately and very politely asked to have the drink I ordered. She took the sunrise away, did not return with a bloody, didn't apologize, and charged us for 2 bloodys and the sunrise. I sat at the bar once waiting for a table and the bartender told me he does not transfer checks to the waitresses because he doesn't get the tips then. The food is amazing, but don't expect the service to be prompt or polite.
2 ||| I would probably give Carl's Cakes 2.5. The lady who dropped off the desserts for my reception was very rude at first. After she found out I was the bride she was a lot nicer but I think she thought I was a wedding planner or something. We traveled for our reception and forgot some things at home. Honest mistake but it was nothing major and she was rude about it. The desserts were delicious but the service was not what I had expected
0 ||| Really I'm the first to review this place that has been here for a gajillion years?? So I should preface by saying the few blocks surrounding the area are the oldest graves in Phoenix, a pioneer site.  \n\nI love this place, too bad it does not love to provide service.  I was attending a conference at Civic Plaza and my hostess was buying.. I scanned Yelp as I had no idea what I wanted to eat and than it hit me..Tuna Wrap with the Zombies in the graveyard!  Too bad when I walked in I requested a bag of sour cream chips be added to my tuna wrap - the cashier looked at me like I was doing crack and refused my request and the sandwich maker asked what was up so I made the request a second time when he refused I asked what the big deal was?  He said because doing so would be a, \"Pain in his ass\" So I said Okay, as a customer it is a pain in my ass to spend my money here.  and left.  My $$$ spends any where and as long as I'm not making unreasonable demands or asking for free well than I worked customer service long enough to know making people happy keeps them coming back!
3 ||| I really like bowling and I really really enjoy \"extreme bowling\".  I love the flashing lights, great music, etc. etc.  AMF Tempe is the only place I have ever extreme bowled so I can't compare it to anywhere else.  I went a lot during high school 15 years ago, but haven't gone back in many many years.  It is WAY better now.  Better music, upgraded computer things, nicer lanes, huge screens for music videos, etc.  Its all pretty nice and an excellent extreme bowling experience.  The crowd is still a bit sketchy but everyone was there to have a good time so no complaints there.  The staff is also excellent and pretty friendly.\n\nIt looked like they had decent beer specials and what looked to be decent bar type food.  I didn't get anything but I wouldn't mind eating, drinking and bowling the night away sometime in the future.\n\nI went last night (Saturday) and it was $18 per person including shoe rental and all-you-can-bowl from 10pm until 1am.  Not really too bad of a deal if you stay there all 3 hours (which I didn't because I'm old now).  My group got there at about 9:40 right before a mad rush of people came in so my advice is to get there 20mins ahead of time to avoid standing in line forever.  They also take reservations so that may come in handy.
3 ||| Only place I trust for hand wash! Reasonably priced for a prestigious wash! They also honor all coupons from Yelp for full service. I've always left here satisfied with the service my on vehicle and customer service received by staff. \n\nThey go soon and beyond on customer service, as I sit here writing this review a service member walked through the door with an elderly customer on his arm helping her in and let me add carrying her purse in his other hand.\n\nLos Olivos also has a shoe shining service available for all those that are stopping by during lunch from work.
2 ||| Like many others I assume, I'm just trying the new \"add a review\" feature from the app. That being said, it's Starbucks. Always consistent and at a premium price.
0 ||| If I could I'd give zero stars! I ordered 2.5 hours ago and the food just barely got here. The pizza had been sitting out for so long it was barely Luke warm and the cheese had gotten a hard like plasticity feel and taste to it. With all the time they took to get here you'd think they could at least give me more then 1 packet of ketchup for my fries (asked for xtra). To top things off the driver was extremely rude and tried to step in my house to grab the food when I called his work to discuss his behavior. Very disappointed and will NEVER ORDER AGAIN! Oh and to top if off they gave me 79cent soda from frys for my coke that I paid 2.50 for. This place sucks and had I known I could post pics on here I would posted a picture of it. My good friend was with me who just happens to be a cook at a fine dining restaurant in the area and choose toaster strudels over the crap presented so rudely at my door!
3 ||| The building is adorable, brick wall warehouse feel. Complimentary valet is also nice. OH & they gave me my beer in a paper bag, hood style, which was pretty cool.\n\nAs far as the food, I should have just ordered appetizers because my meal was horrible!\n\nAppetizers included fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, & fried corn fritters. All of which were delicious.\n\nI ordered the veggie plate which was just a ton of bland food.\n\nService was slow, our orders were wrong, and overall the food is nothing special but very overpriced.\n\nI don't think I'll ever go back.
0 ||| I'll keep this one short - DO NOT GO HERE! We waited about 20 mins to get a beer and then another 1/2 hr to get our check. Asked a couple other waitresses to get our waitress, but she seemed busy elsewhere. Finally came with our checks when a couple of us made it seem like we were walking out without paying.\n\nAnd btw, Flying Saucer is right around the corner and MUCH better. Go there instead. Seriously.
2 ||| Maybe my expectations were too high after I'd heard so many good things about this place because I can't say I was blown away.\n\nThe boyfriend and I are loyal fans of the Farmhouse which is right next door. But we'd been curious about their neighbor for a while so we finally decided to check out Liberty Market. It was a Sunday and I think there was a show at the Hale Theatre because the place was packed. We stood in line for quite a while. \n\nI ordered the demi-breakfast - eggs, biscuit and bacon and the boyfriend ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo. We also ordered a slice of chocolate chip banana bread and a slice of red velvet cake to go because that's just how we roll.\n\nI thought the banana bread was pretty good, boyfriend thought it was too dry. My demi-breakfast was okay but my biscuit was too powdery, like they didn't mix the dough well enough. There was actually a clump of flour in part of it. Considering how amazing the biscuits are at the Farmhouse next door I was disappointed. Boyfriend was not impressed with the quesadilla either.\n\nLater that afternoon we decided to try out the red velvet cake. Like the breakfast, it was just okay. Nothing I would crave or make the trip across town for.\n\nOverall, I like Joe's other places (Joe's BBQ and Farm Grill) much better. Although I will say the staff was very nice and I liked the atmosphere. Maybe their lunch is good? But for breakfast in Gilbert, I'll stick with the Farmhouse from now on.
4 ||| great place great deals really nice staff , i would prefer to do all my business here. \nnothing bad to say about this place. always fair w prices and the guys in the repair shop helped me out giving advice on how to fix a broken bass i had. \nthey rock
2 ||| This place used to be great, with unique dishes, yummy breadsticks with special butters and complimentary white chocolate for dessert. Now it's just average, with nice outdoor seating.
4 ||| I had a pedicure at this place today. The prices are excellent. I paid $22 for the best pedicure I can ever remember getting and I have paid $60+ in some places. I kept expecting to pay more thinking they must be giving me the deluxe pedi instead of the basic one but nope the one I got was the basic one. I'm not even sure what they might add if they have a deluxe pedi accept maybe a paraffin dip or an herbal wrap?\nThey have an attractive clean facility. They actually line the basin where your feet go with a plastic liner that they change between customers, now that is clean! The chairs themselves look brand new. I got the longest foot massage I have ever had with a pedi even when I paid for a so-called deluxe or spa pedi elsewhere. My toes looked great when they were done. I was offered a bottle of water to drink while I waited. I know some places will give you wine, coffee etc but this is not a spa and for that price I am more than happy with water (besides I have to drive).\nBtw, they have male clients as well. In case you guys want to experience one of the things that makes it great to be a woman. \nThe staff was so pleasant and most of them are English speaking. What more could you ask for? Hanna was the girl that did my feet but I saw the others working and they all seemed to do quality work. I am so excited that I found a great affordable place to get some regular pedicures while I'm here. If I can only find a good massage around here I will be in heaven. \nI give them 5 stars because they are better than any spa I have ever been to and a third the price.
0 ||| Worst company in the world.  I had no idea how bad they were.  I was a loyal customer for 20 years but when I needed them they kicked me to the curb.  Axxholes.  I also needed a loss report for my new replacement insurance and they keep bouncing me at customer no service.  Buyer beware from Chubb!
4 ||| Can't beat the price.  Very clean.  Great size rooms.  A very nice breakfast spread!  Pool is small but almost always empty.  Even a small gym on site!  Great deal and would definitely stay again.
3 ||| This one is okay stocked but sometimes you need to double check the prices. Actually a lot of the times you need to watch the prices. Still better than going to Wal Mart.
4 ||| Needed two Palo Verde trees thinned and trimmed.  Received a call back less than 24 hours after leaving a message.\n\nThe estimator showed up the following day, and presented a very fair estimate for the job.\n\nThe crew (Dave and Luis) showed up 2 days later to do the job.  I have to say they did an outstanding job.  Trees look great.  They were very knowledgeable and meticulous in their work.  They literally swept their way off of my property.\n\nHighly recommend!
0 ||| TERRIBLE SERVICE! Just left this place after literally no one felt like trying to sell a vehicle. We entered the lobby one person said hi and that was it. While inside we sat inside the vehicle we were interested in played with some gadgets and still no one in sight to come assist us with any questions. There was 1 other customer in the entire place . We stood in front of the glass fishbowl of associates talking to each other but even with us standing looking at them would anyone come out to help us? No. We even walked outside to view the vehicle we were interested in by ourselves outside and yes you guessed it no one came out to assist us . The year vehicle we were interested in was locked on the lot so we headed inside thinking for sure they have now seen us outside and will say something like can I open that vehicle for you or how about are you wanting to test drive?? To which our answer would have been yes and yes but sadly again my husband and I were ignored. We started to laugh seeing we just left a FORD dealership where they instantly came up to us didn't hover but were never too far away and checked in with us and even brought us water since it was a warm day in AZ. We stood there now inside the CHEVY dealership where 2 more associates passed us not saying one word lol! My husband and I could not believe these folks . Is this a joke? Well needless to say Freeway Chevrolet made our decision easy for us we left with again not one person to thank us for coming in. We are now headed back to FORD and will never be returning to this dealership again and I will make sure I tell everyone I know to never purchase from Freeway Chevrolet!
4 ||| First, the service was amazing!\nSecond, the burger was amazing!\nGo.
3 ||| This is my second dance with Primanti's.  The first was at the Pitt location, which has a better atmosphere in my humble opinion.  I had the #2 most requested sandwich, Cheesesteak.  I asked the waitress what was the most requested item and she said, \"You're drinking it honey.\" pointing to my Iron City pint.  Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.  \n\nSo the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there's a reason they can keep prices low.  There's not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It's dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I'd also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn't seem right and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.  \n\nSo the sandwich and decor of this location would rate 3 stars, but the concept of a restaurant that serves you an oversized sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it for  around 5 bucks rates 5, so it equals out to 4.  This sandwich and chain are one of the reasons I love the Burgh so much.
0 ||| ...and this chit-hole is still open??  WHY???  Must be so the gang-bangers have a place to conduct target practice.
4 ||| One of the best Mexican food restaurants I ever have been to All my friends and family have gone here since early 80's, I live in Los Angeles now and miss the true real deal that El Norteno has. I have three place I consider the \"best\" and this one of the three. One of the Three are closed now sorry to say. When I visit Phoenix we always stop by for Lunch or Dinner. Wish that Los Angeles some how can pick up there flavors compared to Phoenix.
1 ||| Wow. Just was refused service because we had a large group. When we offered to break up and just sit with the family. Nope....not an option. Empty restaurant, and they would not let 18 people sit and eat. Their policy  is \" no teams\".  We had 6 high school girls and 12 parents.  The hostess politely  said they have had teams cause problems.  Well, this policy just cost them. None of these 12 parents will ever return. So I can't tell you how the food is. Just don't walk in as a large group. That is my tip.
4 ||| My son has seen Dr Ritchey since birth. Everyday we are thankful that he came into our life.  We are confident with his abilities and consistently have seen his extraordinary care and dedication (to patients and parents as well!).  He honestly changed our lives!
4 ||| You gotta love the name \"pho kim long\" time lol... The decor here is better than any Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been too and to match the food is top notch! Great place to cure your hangover in Vegas. It's also open 24hrs!!!
3 ||| Well, I recently went here with a friend of mine. She said this is where she usually goes and likes it so I thought I'd try it out. \n\nWe get there it looks pretty nice and once i chose my colors for a Mani and Pedi they get me seated. \nI had this one lady that was going to do my nails and then this lady walks in wanting a fill or something not sure and then i get stuck with some pregnant lady! \nShe did a good massage but didn't get all the callus's off my feet. Then when it came to the nails, everything went down. She didn't file them straight, not really my toes either, it was like her technique or something. And so while she did my massage for my Pedi she would close her eyes like she was into it you know? So while she was doing my Mani i couldn't tell if her eyes were closed. \nShe put the nail polish on to fast because my nails are cracked and bubbled and the polish is way uneven. \n\n\nI think this place has potential, I just think I got stuck with the wrong lady. \n\nOh i forgot pricing my Mani was 12 and my Pedi 18
0 ||| I rented from the Fairfield CA location @1425 W Texas St on 8/9/2006. I reserved online a 26' truck. I had to drive 30 miles, past 6 closer locations to go to this one because that was where the 26' truck was supposedly at a cost of $982.48. When we got there it was a 24' truck. We were moving out of state and had everything ready to go & people at the house to load it, no time for changes. So we took it, not everything fit! Their own paperwork says they may sub LARGER but not smaller! The truck had a gas engine w/ 202,000 miles on it and it was August. we were driving from Napa CA to Tempe AZ. Now you tell me if this is a disaster waiting to happen! The a/c went out in Blythe CA. We drove to Quartzite with no a/c and it was too hot, partly because VERY hot air was blowing out on my legs. Now, we had to get to AZ because had to pick up a family member flying in to the  Phoenix airport that afternoon. So, we called U-Haul and talked to various people. Their plan was for us to turn around and go back to Blythe for repair- it would be the next day at least, probably longer. Now, I am not going to pay for gas and hotel while they fix a truck that they shouldn't have given us in the first place. So, we drove on and got to our hotel in AZ. As soon as I walked in the hotel Asst manager said\" Oh my gosh! let me get you some water\". My face was bright red from the heat. Oh, that is the Airport Hilton, they are great. So, when we got to AZ they told us to take the truck to this location on Priest. It is their service center. They supposedly fixed it while we had to sit and wait because we had no other vehicle in town yet. When they were done (2 hours later) we drove back to the hotel. When we left 1/2 hour later, the a/c was out again! We ended up unloading and driving it back to them with no a/c and temps well oer 110 degrees! Turns out that in the 2 hours they had it they just charged with freon, nnot fixing it like they should have. It needed a new compressor. So, all in all U-HAUL sucks! besides they reservation process won't let you chose a location, they call you the day before and tell you where to pick-up. I used Penske before this and will ever since this, they are much better!!! Oh yeah, they wanted us to make full payment. I went to my credit card company and after MANY phone calls, ended up after all of this having to pay them $736.86. Not much of a discount for causing us so much trouble, stress and health issues for me from heat exhaustion. I was very sick.  Please think before using them! Penske is much better.
3 ||| I fly US Airways almost always for business travel, as they are our preferred travel partner and one of only three airline options for getting me from my office to our home office.  I must say that US Airways is growing on me, despite my early hatred.\n\nI really think that US Airways is improving.  Sure, the fleet could still use a good tune up (I've had more than my fair share of mis-functioning lights/TVs/seats that wouldn't recline over the past few years).  But the people seem to be more friendly than they used to be.  Pilots & flight attendants with a sense of humor!  Gate attendants that don't snap at you for no reason!  Have I had some bad experiences flying with US Airways?  Of course.  No company has a 100% perfect staff, but the good has definitely outweighed the bad in the last 18 months.  And even with the extra baggage fees, it's still always cheaper for me to fly US Airways out of my local airport than to drive the 90 minutes to an airport that has Southwest by the time I submit my reimbursement for the drive.\n\nThe Charlotte hub, however, is always a much better experience than the Philly hub.  I think it must be that good ole Southern charm :)
4 ||| I have always had a great experience at this Arby's.  Although I am not a fan of roast beef, they have many other options such as chicken and salads and their curly fries are amazing!  Their dining area is clean, the staff is always very friendly and the food is tasty and relatively cheap.  I definitely recommend this establishment!
1 ||| I went with a group of friends but they did not have a large  table for us so we were all separated into tables for 2 and some into table for 4.  We were all separated and did not get to chat/socialize at all (uh,uh, not bueno at all).  Yet, at the end of the meal, the waitress went around and passed out to each couple a mandatory 18% tip bill. When I asked the waitress why the 18% when they'd refused to sit us together, she said something about \" but ju still a group\".....whatever.\n\nMy sister in law got really sick from the food and couldn't enjoy the strip.  She ended up going back home after the dinner instead.  She was having  stomach pain from the food.   :((\n\nI am giving 1 star for the variety of food and another star for the parking/convenience.
0 ||| i was convinced that this was my \"go to place\" for my diamond needs. little did i know they took advantage of me when i was in. they knew i had conducted business there in the past and i was upgrading my pinky ring, they took in my pinky ring valued (which i paid $1400 for) charged me another $1500 for a ring that is only .60 of a carrot!!!! i did not know too much about diamonds etc. and barry and jacks son(the owner) took full advantage of me!! boy, do i feel stupid paying close to $3000 for 0.60 of a carrot!! this place is a rip off!! terrible!! do not trust these guys!! please look elsewhere!! we were just about to purchase more rings ( wedding rings ) and again,,,... they tried over charging us!!! i will stop sending guests there and please do yourself a favor and shop elsewhere!! this is not the business i would recommend to anyone. !!stay away!! -jeffrey frischmann
3 ||| I usually just get take out from here, but we like the fact that they have vegetarian and seafood options.
0 ||| Damaged my interior door panel during install, left bubbles causing two visits and still did a poor job.\n\nI got the groupon and came to this place for all my windows. They removed the tint and replaced it with new tint.  The selection was basically medium dark or limo. I chose medium, however, it appears lighter than the factory tint that was on it from the dealer.  When I picked up my car, there were bubbles everywhere! They advised me, though, that the bubbles will go away after a few days.  The tint on my back window was cut too short and some regular window showed, the back passenger window had a cut mark across the tint.\n\nTwo months later, the bubbles remained.  So I brought it back in and asked them to replace the tint that had bubbles (5 windows).  The front desk woman got the tech from the back to insect my car. I advised that my windows are dusty and to bring a rag outside.  When he came out, he made some rude comment that I dont have to tell him how to do his job.  He told the desk woman, who relayed that to me before he came out front.  The tech stated that he could get out the bubbles on one side of the vehicle (three windows) and would replace the rest.  I stressed to them that I do not want to pick it up and have there still be bubbles.  They assured me they would get the bubbles out but if they cant, they will replace.\n\n8 hours later, I pick up the vehicle and there were still bubbles in the windows that they wouldnt replace.  It looked like they popped them and now they are just smaller bubbles but they are still there.  I called this to their attention, the front desk woman, whom stated that they cannot get out all the bubbles and that no one can ever get out all the bubbles.  I advised her that its in their warranty that they warrant against bubbles so why would they deliver the vehicle WITH bubbles if they warranty against them?  She had no answer and said she would notify her manager.  Nothing ever came of that. No manager ever contacted me.\n\nOn my drive home I notice stab marks in my drivers door (in the plastic).  I looked over to the passenger side and there are stab marks in that door as well, but more of them.  It looks like a razor or knife.  Only thing I can imagine is if they have a razor on a belt and were careless during install, the razor began pressing in on my door panel making those marks.\n\nI would NOT recommend this place.  I got my boyfriends windows done right after this and went with another company.  They were awesome and there were not damage or bubbles, I wish I went to them now!
2 ||| Ok I'm spoiled living in vegas... This casino was average.. Casino floor is made to fill small more high end machine everything is pushed towards the middle then out making it a weird feeling. Played 2 hr no big jackpots etc.. there penny and 5 cent machines are out to date. The one game I did have fun with is the middle game monopoly in the middle of casino but everyone was on it.. time to upgrade casino az.. dissapointed
3 ||| Excellent service, food isn't always the best (but if you go on night/grave shift it's MUCH better), and our server Mary is one of the most wonderful people we've ever had the chance of meeting in the service industry.\n\nThis is our hangout every few weeks for late night breakfast with our friends, and we're never disappointed.\n\nThe worst thing is that they took out the 80's music and put some really boring crap in. XD
1 ||| Things started out pretty well; on a Friday night at 6, the wait was only 15 minutes. Pretty much everything was downhill from there, though. They put us in a cozy area downstairs, which was fine, except that they essentially forgot about us. The salads came after the food, only because I reminded the waitress that we never got them. It took the waitress about half an hour to come get a dessert order, and then another half hour to flag her down to get the check. Then another 20 minutes for her to come get the card. It's now been 15 minutes, and I still haven't seen her again. \n\nThe food was actually pretty good, and would have earned the place 3 stars, but a hair in the food bumped it down notch.
2 ||| Appetizer - Satay was good.\nWe asked if we could have the wor wonton soup without calimari, to which the waitress responded with an emphatic \"yes\".  The soup came \"with\" calimari!!!\nRoasted Duck Curry was o.k., but nothing extraordinary.  The Mussaman Curry was also nothing to write home about (we've had better).
2 ||| Breakfast anytime ... and it's hard to mess up breakfast. It's a step up from franchise fast food (McDonald's, Burger King, etc.) on the road but not what I'd call a giant step. The big difference is that you get to sit down while they take your order (as opposed to standing in line at a counter). The coffee is OK but not what I'd call gourmet. Service is friendly and helpful.
3 ||| This gulf course is not the nicest. Just sayin. There are lots of cute bunnies around here. Also the way the course is laid out is a maze but once you've been around a couple times you get the hang of it.
1 ||| This place is super cute. The slide is a blast for kids! The food is alright. Just alright. The service is not good at all. We came for my best friend's birthday and upon arrival we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. We asked if we could sit in the bar area to order a drink and we were told we could order drinks and appetizers while we waited. So we ordered some snacks and drinks. We were hungry! About three minutes later they said our table was ready! We wouldn't have ordered all the snacks if we'd known the wait would only be three minutes! We asked the server what happened and she was rude and dismissive. Totally not apologetic. The service in general was unappreciative and smug. Definitely didn't feel appreciated at all. We ordered dessert to go and they didn't give us napkins or utensils. Bummer.
3 ||| Wow, I don't see what all the horrible reviews are about. I switched here from LA Fitness and am so much happier. I never received the high pressure sales tactics for memberships or trainers that I did at LA Fitness. I like the layout and it's not overcrowded. Seriously, you get what you pay for. I don't expect a top notch towel service gym for this rate..but....I get the equipment I need, the service I like and have no complaints.
2 ||| It's been a while since we've dined at a Claim Jumper restaurant.  We picked this place because it was half way between us and where a friend was visiting and it's just off the 101.  We were disappointed to learn that some of our favorite dishes are no longer on the menu.  We loved the Crispy Asian Chicken Salad....gone.  What about the Salad Bar?  Gone.  Dammit.  Instead we settled on the following items:\n\nSliders, $10.99\nPotato Skins, $9.99\nBaby Back Ribs, $23.99\n\nThe Potato Skins were very good and so were the Sliders.  However, the Baby Back Ribs were terrible.  They were too dry and didn't \"slide\" off the bone like you'd expect them to.  Next time, we'll pass on those.\n\nOur server was very friendly and entertaining.  She also never rushed us.  Since we were meeting friends on this visit, we had a long dinner and stayed for drinks and Dessert much later than most diners.  She was super cool about it and stopped by to check in on us from time to time.\n\nToo bad about our deleted favorite menu items.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%
2 ||| I begged my husband to come here prior to returning our rental car due to the reviews. If I was only reviewing the maple donut, I would say 10 stars out of five. The maple donut is absolute perfection - crispy on the outside, moist and cakey on the inside, and everything a donut should be. Next on my list in order of flavor was the cinnamon crumb donut, which was also pretty good. I tried the apple fritter based on the reviews here but found it entirely too greasy, almost as if it had been double-fried, and way too sweet. I could only take one bite. The coffee was also pretty bad. I think one other reviewer described it as \"diner style\" which I didn't realize was an insult until after I drank it. I'd come back here every week for maple and cinnamon crumb donuts, and maybe to try the old fashioned glazed, but I definitely wouldn't get the coffee or the apple fritter again.
0 ||| Horrible, horrible property management company. Don't even know where to begin, but I totally agree with previous reviewer that communication is extremely poor and when I tried to give feedback on this, explaining in a calm way why we were canceling our contract with them, Mario (owner) became extremely defensive and arrogant. \n\nThey obviously don't give a rats ass about you as a client (property owner) or the renters. They failed to notify us that the renters abandoned the property and left two months early on the lease, the only way I found out was to drive by myself. Then there was a lot of back pedaling when I tried to find out why no one called us the moment they were notified by tenants that they had left, so we could have put utilities back on before pool turned green. They knew about it on Friday and falied to tell us until I contacted them myself almost five days later. Unacceptable. Now our pool is green as power was off several days in summer. \n\nWhenever there were problems at the property, such as dryer breaking down, etc, it took a ridiculously long time for them to handle it and communicate. They basically are in it for the $$ they collect, quite easily with the online payments they demand from tenants, and are not the least bit interested in giving good customer service to either the tenant or the property owner. We will be filing a complaint with better business bureau and letting others know, they are just terrible and should not get away with conducting business this way.
1 ||| Pros: love the music they played (electrovibes like Portishead) and the atmosphere was wonderful. Our server was also very pleasant.\n\nCons: I ordered the chicken marsala, as I'm chewing, I crunch on something hard. Turned the chicken over and there were little black chunks that looked like plastic bits.  \n\nWhen I asked the server about it, he said \"I think it's allspice\". Which I did not believe and I told him that if it's allspice then it shouldn't be black, hard, non-chewable bits. \n\nWe paid and left. I will not be going back but maybe this was a one-time incident. Nonetheless, good atmosphere, music, and wine..
2 ||| Showmars has Gyro's, I love Gyros.  These are not great Gyros.  They are 3 star Gyros.  I think the pita bread they use is too brittle.  It shouldn't crack in half when you hold it so everything falls out.  I lived in a Greek neighborhood for a few years and let me tell you, the Greeks know how to eat.  The service is friendly and they have burgers and fries (yum).  If you're close to one and you're hungry it's a decent place with a big menu for a reasonable price.
3 ||| Good selection, well stocked, and fairly reasonable prices. I like the food and wine sections best - lots of my favorite British desserts, candies, and chocolates at decent prices. Also a good place to go if you need to find a gift for someone but you're not sure what to get.
2 ||| Absolutely delicious! Love the Icelandic smoked salmon crepe and the Nutella crepe. However, they are almost never open and the older gentleman (who I assume to be upper management) can be quite rude!\n\nI have been there a few times and have no problem with the younger servers at all, who have actually been extremely pleasant and friendly. My biggest complaint is the manager/owner who literally hung up on me not but five minutes ago!! Had it not been for him, I would have given it 4 stars.\n\nIf you don't mind potentially rude service, I would recommend giving it a try. On the other hand, sometimes it's not worth it.
3 ||| We like this place. From now on we will keep going to this moviehouse since it has a nice parking space for disabled. Lots of shade and pushing someone in a wheelchair is much easier. Shades, Shades all over the place and we loved it,
3 ||| Delicious.  Loved the salsas as they were super fresh and you can request a spicier version.  Our dinners were just as delicious.
0 ||| I rented a car from phx airport  and was going to return it to LAX on June 9. I wasn't sure if I was going to return the car earlier or later, so I asked the person at the counter what would I be charged. They said the rate I have, it would just be adjusted to the days I actually used. .. well to make a long story short, I returned the car one week early in Arizona. The original rental rate had me at just over 1,050 (taxes and fees made it this high). When I looked at my American express account, there was a pending charge for 395 plus the bill was over 1,500 (so I would have paid over 1,900). According to what I was told at the counter, the bill should have been much closer to 750. I called, after much discussion, they reduced the bill to my original 1,050 saying that is the best they could do. I called customer service again a week or so later. Both conversations said I signed the contract saying that the rate could change. I then told them what was said to me at the pickup counter. Both times they said I signed, which I did not knowing that they would not stand behind what was said. I then told both customer service representatives that if I was to stand at the counter and read the documents in their entirety, it would really slow down their rental capacity and so I relied on their own rental agents response, BIG mistake,. Hertz will never see my business ever again, they clearly don't care about the customer anywhere near their bottom line. I hope Hertz goes of business, I would never treat anyone the way Hertz treated me, I hope they are glad they have my money....greedy, greedy jerks
1 ||| This location is significantly below par and in need of major upgrades. The building, carts, inside just don't give the patron a good impression about the quality of the products sold there.
4 ||| Family style atmosphere. Food was delicious. Owner talked to us and made suggestions based on our palate. He actually took the time to listen. Coolest thing I saw was when the couple at the other table had finished and were getting ready to discard half their food, he kind of took offense as he stated \"I hate to waste food\" and  turned their remaining food into sandwiches and sides to take home at no additional charge. I thought that was very cool. This place is what small businesses should be all about. Great food. Will definitely return. Even gave us tips on where to get excellent Mediterranean groceries!
3 ||| Let me make myself clear, the only reason I am giving the Rokerij 4 stars is because of the downstairs.  This downstairs bar area of the restaurant has a taverny-old world-European feel to it.  It is usually crowded, but despite the crowd, the atmosphere still feels fairly intimate.  They have a decent wine list with friendly bartenders.  I enjoyed a nice Malbec which seems to be hard to come by here in Phoenix.  This is a great place to relax with a couple of friends or a casual date, but not a good place for large groups.\n\nAs for the upstairs dining room...I was not impressed.  The restaurant attempts to keep a similar theme from the downstairs, but in a more fine dining way.  It doesn't really work.  I am a small person and the booths swallowed me up because they are so huge.  The booths have pillows but there is just something weird about sitting on a pillow to reach the table.  I felt like a child but not in a good way.\n\nOur server was great, she was new, but she did a great job.  I can imagine we would have stressed her out a bit more had we been more high maintenance.  The food, well, did not live up to its glory.  Let's just say I wasn't in a hurry to finish my food or willing to take anything home with me.  The food just missed something and was over powered by one particular sauce that left a terrible aftertaste.  \n\nTo sum things up, check out the basement but avoid the dining room, the whole fine-dining thing is completely overrated.
0 ||| The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better.
4 ||| Come here 1-3 times each time I visit my grandparents in Vegas. It's a fantastic spot for locals (don't tell the tourists or they'll take over!!), with authentic and delicious Italian food.\n\nI try to branch out, but get the chicken cacciatore pasta special every time. I LOVE IT!!! The portion sizes are humongous and last at least two meals. The wine selection is great and the owner is a complete doll.\n\nLove, love LOVE this place!
1 ||| i went in to get a new collar and a jolly ball. i kept wandering around trying to find the jollyball but couldn't and  NO ONE would help. so i bought the collar and left. so frustrating. you can't ever get customer service in this store
3 ||| I've flown out of terminal 4 & 2. Don't think I've ever been in 3. As a kid I used to love the moving sidewalks in 4. Now as an adult I seem to always fly out of 2.\n\nMy last trip out went well. My flight was for 6:30am. I showed up at about 5am & made it to the gate with 20 min to spare. It was ridiculously easy to park in the West Economy lot & walk right to terminal 2.\n\nThere didn't seem to be enough people working to hand out boarding passes or take your luggage you want to check. We had to stand there and wait for a while even though there were hardly any people in line at the time. Also, the guy that took our luggage was rather grumpy.\n\nThe security line went well. The people working security were actually rather nice. I forgot to take my shoes off & the guy joked with me about it while I took them off.\n\nAll in all, I've always liked my home town airport.
3 ||| Me and my bf decided to go here to find some boba we can cook at home and make our own boba tea and green tea ice cream. Lots of unique Asian food and meats (every organ of the pig and cow) and even fish that they hold in a tank to keep it fresh before butchering which was neat to see. My bf was overjoyed when he found some noodle packages he had and loved a long time ago and immediately stuffed 10 packs into our basket. If you wanna find all things Asian (and food from other countries like the middle east and Hawaii) come here.
4 ||| Just a whole bunch of yum going on at Portofino's. \n\nArrived at the South park location at 6:30 on a Friday - they don't take reservations- and the place was already pretty busy for dinner, but we were able to be seated right away.\n\n\nAttentive service.\nHuge portions ( like 2 meals worth of leftovers huge)\nDelicious specials\n\nAlthough the pasta dishes looked fantastic, I opted for the Seafood Pescatore special. Risotto with a touch of marinara and laden with fruits from the sea - including a half filet of salmon on top.\n\nIt was divine as was the Ahi Tuna special served with a side of polenta with a creamy pepper sauce.\n\nDelicious bread and decent wine list rounded out the dining experience.\n.\nIf you're in the mood for Italian, head to Portofino's.\nAnd go hungry or stay home!
3 ||| Here's something weird if you want to stick to a suburban mom living in Gilbert stereotype- I can't justify spending more than $15 on a haircut. I've certainly gone that route, and you know what? $40 or $15, there is NO difference at all! To be fair, I do one cut, and then grow my hair out to donate to Locks Of Love, so I don't have a lot of upkeep on my 'do. Regardless, I still can't do it. I know a lot of people are weird about who touches their hair. They have a relationship with their stylist or whatever. Well, you can build a relationship and spend less here too. The whole family has been coming to this location for years, and the staff is always friendly, and they've always understood exactly what my children have wanted done with their hair. None of us have ever complained, and they take competitors coupons. Weekends tend to be busier, but if that's the case then you can become the stereotype and get yourself a Starbucks while you're waiting. ;-)
1 ||| I do not understand the hype about this place. Everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre. I did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable. I got the shrimp Diane which I'm pretty sure was just shrimp, mushrooms, white rice and chicken broth. Thank God I only went bc I had a groupon.
3 ||| I went to Roma Garden to help cheer up a friend who was recently let down by his fellow man.   He said a rich creamy Alfredo would perk him up.  I had just heard about Roma Garden and it was in my friend's  neighborhood so we went.  The restaurant faces East in the strip mall on the South West corner of 40th St. and Thunderbird.  Next to Panda Express.  It is not a big place.  We were the only guests there for an early dinner.  Candlelight and fresh roses at the table and I still didn't feel cozy.  My knife had something on it.  I ended up not using it.  We were the first guests of the evening and it seemed like our waiter hadn't adjusted to the fact that he was at work.  Kind of sluggish.  Not impressed so far.\n\nThe bread saved the day.  It was hot and fresh and was accompanied by an herb butter.  My main dish was the Chicken Saltimbocca.  The ingredients were fresh and the side of pasta and marinara were good.  My guest won in my book.  He had ravioli with lobster and crab topped with pink sauce.  He got his rich and creamy.  I had a sample.  Wow!!!\n\nFor dessert I had the tiramisu.  It was presented well and tasted okay.  My friend had the chocolate mousse cake and he said it reminded him of Jello pudding.  This one did not stand out.  It was presented well though.\n\nI would come back for the bread and would try something else on the menu.\n\nRoma Garden was A-OK.
0 ||| On 02/25/14, I ordered (1) \"Etac Long Handle Back Scrubber and Body Washer\" (item #187169) from Allegro Medical in the amount of $32.46 (23.01 + 9.45 shipping).

3 ||| I lived in the valley from 1999 to 2004 and now get back to Phoenix every few years, wife had not been back n 10 years. First stop of the plane is to head here and order a 'Beef' and Chicago Dog. Hands Down the best outside of Chicago. Have seen some people complain about the prices but hey, its a small business and it costs money to get the original supplies and such. The Dogs were overflowing and the beef was great too. Nt the worlds most impressive, physically but the best does not have to change much. Good job Bob, see you next year :)
3 ||| The rooms are clean and the beds are comfy, the staff is friendly, and the location is excellent. There was a nice sized fridge in the room which is a plus in my mind. I think if they were to put some coffee/tea making facilities in the room, that would be great. Their free wifi worked great, even for streaming Netflix. We were on business at the University and everything was a short walk away, no need to car rentals and parking.
0 ||| I would give 0 stars if I could!  I am in the process of relocating from Phoenix to Seattle and due to the last minute notice of the move, I had initially moved out to Seattle with my car a month prior and then flew back to Phoenix to pack all my belongings and officially move to Washington. I knew that I would be needing a car while in Phoenix, and was really excited about the cheap deal I had found to rent a car with advantage. When I arrived at Advantage, I was told that because my driver's license still had an address of Phoenix I needed to provide a copy of my insurance in order to rent the car, which was not possible for me to obtain because it was located in Washington.  The rental reservation had been made two week prior, and no notice of this policy had been communicated to me. I explained my situation and the service attendant apologized and said that there was nothing they could do, which left me carless and having to go to another company and pay over 5x the amount.
2 ||| They were replacing the window motor in my ford explorer (a very simple fix). I even brought the part with me, and they got it in the garage right away with a quote of around $100, so at this point I was excited. It ended up taking over 2 hours to replace the part, and there were about 5 people trying to figure out the problem at different times. Many times the car was completely unattended in the garage for over 15 minutes at a time. When the car was finally done, the window control panel was all kinds of messed up, Im not sure exactly how that happened. Good price, but you get what you pay for I guess. I wouldnt recommend this place for any serious auto repairs. I wouldve given a 4 star before the window control panel situation.
3 ||| I have been thinking that today is Saturday all day long. But inherently I know today is Sunday because yesterday was Saturday, and yesterday's events looked much different than today's, but still, all day long, it felt like Saturday. Imagine my surprise when I went to dinner and found out at a tiny, Sushi-dive that it was indeed Sunday. \n\nI walked in and, I am shocked because, again, I am thinking that it is Saturday night and I am one of only five or six Guests in this place at 5:45 p.m! \n\nI ask for the Sushi bar and they hand me my sushi menu and a pencil and stamped across the menu says something to the effect \"Sushi Happy Hour - Sunday thru Thursday - 5 - 6 p.m. - Nigiri\" It's Sunday night and its before 6 p.m., SCORE!\n\nI order hot tea, spicy scallop, uni, roe and quail egg; and for dessert I ordered freshwater eel - my tab - less than $14. \n\nOutside of the sushi chef, my service was non-existent (which is why I love, love, love Sakana), all the same, Sushi Ko was a nice little find on a Sunday night.
2 ||| Well i have definitely had better smoothie's and the Staff while friendly seemed a bit stressed. The guy making the smoothies i think owned the franchise and the girl that was working for him didn't really seem interested in selling smoothies as she was trying to sell other products in the store. I had a strawberry malt...which was not bad which is why i did give it 3 stars rather than 2. My wife had the Pineapple, Strawberry, Kiwi, with protein smoothie. I tried it and i didn't really think any protein was in it....but wife did and she enjoyed and i guess that is all that matters...LOL\n\nThe other major problem was the price...a small cost about 5.00 for my malt and the smoothie was close to 4 bucks. You can get a large one for that price at Jamba Juice and while the products at Smoothie King are all-natural that is still expensive. So if you want a decent smoothie for the price go to Jamba Juice...if you want all natural, expensive but decent smoothies then go to Smoothie King. Eat, Drink and be Merry my friends!!!!
2 ||| Spinning.  Hardcore.  That about sums it up.  Give it a try if you want a workout that will totally kick your ass and leave you crying.
1 ||| Borrrring.\n\nThis place was actually my first job ever.  I was 15.... ohhh, those were the days....\n\nWhile I was 15, I tried everything on the menu... and I think my favorite item was the generic frozen then fried jalapeno poppers.  Ha!\n\nAs an adult of 27 years old, I decided to retry this old haunt, and found the food to be dull, boring, and quite frankly it reminded me of Lubys....\n\nI do like their BBQ sauce though, and I always buy it at the grocery store.  See, I'm loyal!
1 ||| I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain, but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though). \n\nAlthough I will say that the service was awesome, the \"good\" ends there. \n\nThe food, meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough), spinach dip (I've had better), and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it. \n\nThe drinks, they were made well, but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn't make me very happy at all. \n\nNext time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy.
2 ||| I have to admit that I have a love-hate relationship with Lo-Lo's.  The chicken is incredible, the waffles are okay, but the service always drives me nuts!  I'm okay with the sticky menus, the soggy mac and cheese can be overlooked as well, but don't disrespect me or make us wait 30 minutes for a plate of chicken.  \n\nIf you're not in a hurry, you will probably love this place, but be prepared for some southern style mosy-like service.  \n\nHere are some tips worth the read:  the chicken is great, but if you really want to taste some soul food, you've got to get the dark meat and collard greens with waffles.  When you order your drink, you've got to try the Kool-aid.  Yes, I'm serious!\n\nLo-Lo's you've got me all worked up again.  If you could just have some friendly, fast service, I'd be regular and you'd be a bit richer.
2 ||| I really was not very impressed with the quality of the food. The meat was very dry and the sauce they used to disguise it in was bland and greasy. Yea, yea I know it's mexican food so I should expect some grease, but a puddle of yellow oil surrounding the plate? Yuck. The only redeeming quality was the chips and salsa bar. The tomatillo and adobo salsas were excellent. Not good enough for me to return, but made the wait bearable.
0 ||| I would rather eat a raw fish out of Tempe Town Lake than have to sit through another disgusting meal at Red Lobster. Gggggeeeeerooooossss!
4 ||| Awesome as usual.  Delivery was right on time, both the order taker were pleasent and professional, and the pizza has always and seams to continue to rock.
4 ||| SSSHHHHHHHH    \n\nbut they are the most honest,,  upfront mechanics in Charlotte, \n\nThey have helped myself and many of my friends  with car problems ! and I have never felt cheated !
4 ||| This place is definitely great. Any entree I have had has been excellent.. The service is great too. Bartender is very friendly and the atmosphere is very nice ! I'm going to be a regular for sure!
1 ||| Went there on a Tuesday night. It was busy but no wait for counter seating. The place is a hole in the wall and doesn't feel clean. We ordered the crab fried rice, salmon skin salad, grilled squid, mountain yam with seaweed salad, and a variety of Yakitori including beef tongue. Nothing really stood out. Our neighbor ordered a yellowtail sashimi which actually looked better than all our dishes. The most tasteless were the Yakitori/skewers. No special sauces thus quite bland. The best dish was the grilled squid. Left rather unsatisfied.
3 ||| $12 for All You Can Eat Korean BBQ from 11pm-5am. What more can i say, what more can you ask for?! Great service even at 4am in the morning when I went, the sides were fresh and the meats were tasty. -1 star for no Galbee, but at this price, who can complain?!
4 ||| Insanely delicious.  I don't know how else to describe my dinner there.  My husband and I were in Phoenix for a long weekend and wanted some good Mexican food.  (Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for pointing me towards Mariscos Playa Hermosa.)\n\nThis adorable little restaurant looks like absolutely nothing from the outside- just a plain looking building with a sign.  The inside, though, is cute and definitely has an authentic Mexican feel.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and seated. Within a few minutes, we were offered beers and tortilla chips.  We opted for guacamole to compliment our tortillas, the former of which I was suspicious at first because of the seemingly runny consistency.  Boy, was I wrong - the guac was tangy and full of flavor. I would love to have their recipe!    \n\nBased on other review, we opted for the molcajete for our main curse.  It. Was. Off. The. Hook.  It arrived in a medium-sized, deep bowl, filled half-way with a delicious spicy cheesy gray.  Along the sides of the bowl are shrimp, chicken, beef and scallops.  We just kind of pushed all the meats into the sauce and then dug in.  And while this dish is meant to serve up to 4 persons, we totally killed it and finished every bite.  (Disclaimer:  I'm a small person and really don't eat that much.... The molcajete was JUST THAT GOOD.)  \n\nThe next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll make sure to return to Mariscos!
3 ||| I'm not really a Pho kinda guy.  But a friend loves the place so we went.  I had the pork chops, which aside from them being really thin were actually pretty tasty.
0 ||| I have a 2003 Honda Accord and recently the Engine Light came on, I took it down to a local oil, lube and tire shop, Gunnel's Tires, which we frequent because of their outstanding customer service and attention to detail. Gunnel's recommended Kelly's Automotive, so we called and made an appointment to have it taken in.\n\nMy wife took the car in on a Tuesday and was at the location at 8 am sharp, ready for our \"appointment\" only to find out that, in the words of the attendant, \"Oh, well we just had a bunch of cars come in. Can you leave it till Thursday?\"\n\nWhat is the point in making an appointment if the establishment you made the appointment with doesn't keep it?! I feel that Kelly's Automotive was extremely unprofessional in regards to this and I personally will not ever \"try\" them again. The worst part is when service-based companies have no respect for their \"customers\" time. AVOID these guys at all cost... Unless you want to leave your car for a week or more.
4 ||| Yoga Pura definitely lives up to its reputation-this IS the best studio in the valley for those looking for authentic yoga. Everyone here from the welcoming staff to the knowledgeable teachers and the amazing community of students makes this place feel like home-which is what Pura means in Sanskrit!\n\nEric, the studio owner, is friendly, approachable and always makes himself available to students.  He has done so much for the community.  He is the creator of Bootstrap-a free program for troops and veterans suffering from the effects of military related stress, and he architected and teaches the most highly-respected 500-hour Teacher Training program in the state.  \n\nDefinitely the best place in the valley to practice...and the first class is free!
1 ||| We love this place but $20 for a wristband for only 1 hour is not long enough.  It doesn't give you time to enjoy the rides and you obviously don't have time to stop and eat or go to the bathrooms.  If it happens to be crowded, then you only get on a few rides and the $20 wristband ends up being more expensive than the individual tickets.  We would go more often if they would fix this.  1.5 hours for $30 but it's the same principal, if you pay that much, you still can't stop to eat or anything so it's not worth it either.  $30 should be an all day pass, similiar to what Circus Circus does.
2 ||| I was expecting an authentic indonesian restaurant in madison. reason is that there are many indonesian student in Madison. but apparently, not.\ndon't get me wrong, it is not bad, because the food is now tailored to american taste. I'm kinda surprise to see soo many people in the restaurant, and I'm the only non white.\nI ordered empek2, sayur lodeh, tahu and some other items.\nthe food don't even look right (close), but it don't taste even close to what it supposed to be.\nif you think you've taste indonesian food and you think that place taste good. wait till you taste the real good one. it will blow your sock off.\n\ngood place to get to know indonesian food. but for people who are looking for good indonesian food, not here.
3 ||| It was really hot, I was tired, I was in a part of town I wasn't very familiar with, and I really, really, wanted a good, big, all around typical American burger. Looking around at the places nearby I just wasn't sure if I could find anything tasty in this area at all.\nHowever, Yelp led me here, and with the strangely high reviews I decided to just go for it and I was very pleasantly surprised.\nIt was a big burger, it was good with lots of toppings, I can't really say much. A burger is a burger and it was standard and good! It wasn't a little greasy guilty pleasure like that of In-n-Out or I Love Burger. And it wasn't a flavor-adventure like one would find at Bachi Burger. It was just a standard, big, filling burger, and it was actually good.\nAlso, the service is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed! Like I said, I was tired, hot and hungry, and in a foreign part of town, and I was thoroughly comforted and rejuvenated by this experience. And even though this happened maybe over a month or two ago, lately I find myself thinking about it and even craving another burger from Blue Ox.\n\nFor me, this place was a surprisingly cool haven in the middle of a hot and exhausting day. I was not expecting to like it as much as I did. Hope to see them again soon, yum!
3 ||| Pho was okay. Authentic enough for my oh-so-discerning-pho-palate. Sense the sarcasm? But in all honesty, the pho was not at all bad for the midwest. \n\nTypical menu items. Decent soup base. The noodles were a little overcooked and clumped at the bottom of my bowl, and the sprouts that came with the pho were a little limp, but overall, nothing too difficult to overlook. \n\nWhy the two star rating then? Service. \n\nWe got there at 12:30PM and there was already a healthy cluster of folks waiting at the entrance.  I looked around for a sign-up sheet, but there wasn't one, so I figured the wait must not be too bad. Plus, there were quite a few groups finishing up with their meals.  We'd probably be seated in 10-15 minutes tops, I thought.\n\n...20 minutes later, I was still watching the same waitress clearing the same table that she had started clearing when we had walked in, and NO ONE from the waiting area had been seated yet. Are you pho'king kidding me?! I had half a mind to wrestle the dishcloth out of her hands and clear the tables myself. \n\nAs if the whole process wasn't painful enough to watch, each time she finally cleared a table, she'd saunter slowly over to the entrance and ask the crowd: \"who's next?\" What. \n\nHere's a tip for you, Saigon Noodle. Invest in a clipboard, pen, and piece of lined paper. Start a wait list.  I promise you this will make your lives easier and your patrons MUCH happier.\n\nFellow pho lovers, if you don't want to deal with this BS, get there early.
3 ||| I visited this place a couple of times with Phoenix-area friends, the interior is pleasant though almost a bit too slick/trendy for my tastes, they also have a nice outdoor dining area (heated during chillier winter evenings). All the sushi & maki I tried were very good, they really ought to have some combo/sampler platters on their menu to help those who are not sushi-literate or just can't make up their minds. The menu offers other entrees for non-sushi people. For dessert, I recommend strolling over to the gelato place just south of Zen 32.
4 ||| Awesome wings! Try the raspberry chipotle...   Service is hit or miss, but ate on the patio today and had an exceptional server! Seriously, try the bone-in wings!
3 ||| I just attended a cocktail reception, so my review is based on that experience. We were at the Compass Room which is always a cool experience given the 360 degree views. The wine they served was really good. I had an amazing port that paired really well with the chocolate truffles they served. I haven't seen the hotel since they renovated so it was great to see the changes. I'm anxious to go back when I have time and see the rest of the changes.
1 ||| For Take and Bake Pizza , go down the road to Super Target on PD. It is  better.
0 ||| If not one of the ugliest airports in the US certainly one of the most  depressing. In desperate need of some renovations, especially the outcast terminal 2 home to united & continental.  Driving around and out of the terminals can be a bit tricky and you may end up doing a few laps if you miss your exit.  Also, getting a rental car offsite can test your patience.  However, the short and long term parking lots are convenient and fairly inexpensive.\n\nAnd if you are in need of 1,000+ new pieces of luggage or some free stuff swing by the baggage claim and help yourself.
2 ||| I've been here several times and MOST of the elderly ladies (there are a couple of nice ones) that volunteer here are rude. The Assistance League of Las Vegas do lots of good for the Vegas community and you would think that the ladies that represent them would be kind like the organization.  Prices are a bit high (like retail) but there are bargins to be found. Store is clean & organized.
3 ||| This place and I have a long relationship. I'm really fond of it. The venue is beautiful on the Biltmore golf course. \n\nMy mothers pancakes were beautiful, hot and tasty. My Cobb salad was prepared to perfection but lacking in flavor. Too they toss in carrots and red cabbage - I'm not sure why. \n\nOn a sunny day, it's a delight even with the carrots and red cabbage.
1 ||| Summary: highly overrated and apparently very inconsistent as identified by other reviewers.  Extremely pricey, fills up quickly, no parking, but decent service.  If I was looking only for pizza, I'd look elsewhere.\n\nDetailed review: we've been reading the Yelp reviews about this place for a few months and couldn't wait to try it out.  So, we decided to make the short trek down to Regent Street; with the snow, the roads were interesting but definitely passable.\n\nFinding parking was our first challenge... there's no lot, and there isn't any space near the actual restaurant.  We eventually found parking in one of the hospital ramps across the way.\n\nWe entered the Greenbush, and were immediately charmed by the quaint and cozy setting.  It's definitely small - it'll maybe seat 60 people, and if you're taller than six-feet, you'll be ducking the entire time.  A hostess sat us near the bar at a small two-top table.\n\nWe browsed the drink list and menu for a bit; our server stopped by to take our drink orders - a Spotted Cow and a glass of Pinot Noir.  We also ordered the cheesy garlic bread with marinara ($6).\n\nWithin a few minutes, we decided to try a pizza.  The pastas sounded great, but this place is known for it's pizza, so we chose the 12\" thin crust with pepperoni, capicola ham, roasted peppers, and basil.\n\nThe bread arrived; three average sized slices of fairly dry bread with a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese and a cold dish of marinara.  Light on garlic flavor, but thankfully it wasn't drenched in butter or anything like that.\n\nThe place was quickly filling up, and our waiter became a little more scarce, but for good reason - when the place fills up, you can't see more than 3-4 feet around you and trying to navigate the crowds is challenging to say the least.\n\nOur pizza arrived and it was burned to a crisp - the top was so burned that we couldn't see any peppers or basil.  The waiter said something about the \"crust wouldn't firm up\" and offered to cook us a new pizza if we didn't like this one.  \n\nWe took one bite and figured we could burn toast at home if we wanted that charred taste, so we ordered a new pizza.  The second pizza arrived within 10 minutes or so, and it was cooked much better on top, but the crust was soft and flimsy.  \n\nThe toppings were sparce; the pepperoni greasy, and we couldn't detect much basil flavor at all.  The chewy/doughy crust seemed a bit undercooked, but given the alternative, we gnawed away on it \"as was.\"\n\nThe bill arrived - $46.  ZOIKES.  Really?  $46 for 2 drinks, an appetizer, and a 12\" thin crust pizza that tasted like a mediocre frozen pizza?  Me thinks not.\n\nGreenbush = FAIL\n\nService = 3.5 stars (decent; got worse as place filled up)\nFood = 1.5 stars (highly - HIGHLY - overrated)\nValue = 0 stars\nMisc = 4 stars (liked the atmosphere and cozy nature)\n\nAs we were leaving, we came to the conclusion that the Greenbush seems to attract an older, more yuppie-ish crowd that probably enjoys the cozy setting, nice wine list, and bland food.  Next time I feel like pizza, I'll look elsewhere.
3 ||| Nice ambience, friendly staff but super slow service. It was packed on the Friday we came in and they had one server in the section we sat in which is only out of two sections excluding the bar. We sat for about 10 minutes until we got a server and we currently have been waiting for at least 20 minutes for our check. Yummy drinks though!
4 ||| This little Thai treasure consistently delivers!  I have ate there and had carry out many times.  The service is excellent, atmosphere is fairly basic and quiet and the food is excellent!  To-date this is my favorite Thai place in Charlotte and I highly recommend you give it a try.
1 ||| The Original Oyster House is a restaurant I've been intending to visit for quite some time, and finally got around to trying last evening.  Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed.  As you walk in, it comes across as a bit of a small, a little bit dingy, diner.  I have no problem with that, I happen to love diners, but it's not what I would expect from a place I am hoping to get good seafood.  The selection for beer with dinner was rather limited (but let's face it we weren't going there for beer, it's just something I noticed)  The service was seriously lacking.  When asking for our order, the waitress was literally on her cell phone.  I could never tell if she was paying attention to us or not.   \n\nI also found the set-up of the restaurant to be rather lacking.  It feels very claustrophobic, and while we were sitting up at the counter, a number of people bumped into me due to the fact that there is very little room to walk around.  \n\nNow, as far as the food goes, nothing was BAD, but it wasn't stellar.  Nothing on the menu seemed to be \"Great\" to me.  I ordered clam strips, and there was absolutely nothing special about them whatsoever.  They are the same clam strips I could get anywhere else I were to ever go.  There was no extra flavoring, no pizazz, nothing.  Just some strips of clam fried up.  Same goes for the french fries.  Now, the green beans I got were of note, because they were really gross.  There was no flavoring added to them whatsoever, they were just plain, boring, soggy green beans.  I was very much let down.\n\nSo all in all, if you are looking for something quick and find yourself downtown, the Original Oyster House is perfectly acceptable.  If you are looking for some place that makes very unique, delicious seafood meals, find something else.
0 ||| I don't understand why this place is popular.  The food was bad and the service was bad.  I ordered a burger medium well and got it medium rare.  After sending it back and getting another it was still medium/medium rare but I was too hungry to send it back again and lost all faith in their cooks.  I think they served it on the same plate with the same cold fries as before.  My friend ordered a breakfast dish and it was terrible.  The scrambled eggs were so overcooked they were hard and rubbery, the potatoes were very undercooked, and the biscuit was dry and literally had no flavor.  None.  The service seriously lacked as well.  No one was unfriendly, just incompetent.\n\nWe thought the dessert would redeem them but after paying so much for a single slice of cheesecake we couldn't even finish it.  One slice was dried out and the other cheesecake had too much sour cream - it was actually mushy and very sour, almost spoiled tasting.\n\nBottom line, I found this place to be mediocre at best, and that's being generous. There's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city.  Never going back, and I think the food has made me ill.
0 ||| THE Worst McDonald's I have ever experienced. Believe me, I'm a vet & have been to them all around the world too! Find another; it's easy enough to do.
3 ||| This Walmart is the closest to me, so this is the one I have shopped at for years. They recently remodeled it, so now it carries groceries as well as the normal retail section. \n\nI have to say that this store has the worst customer service I have ever seen. The employees are not interested in helping customers. They seem to only be focused on stocking the shelves and going home to their lives. \n\nWhile the prices are fantastic, it is always difficult to find what you are looking for, because they keep changing where everything is located. \n\nAlso when it finally comes time to check out, you should be prepared to wait for at least 10-15 minutes, even if you only have one item.\n\nOverall, it could be a lot better. However the store is pretty clean and you still go home with what you were expecting.
1 ||| Over priced and they forgot my friends pizza order, so I had to wait while mine got cold until theirs came. \nTook way too long to get my drink refills.
0 ||| This location is pretty terrible. There's people walking inside and out always asking for money and there are cops always present. Most of the food I've ever got at the deli was cold and if you want to get everything you want, you might as well come during restock. The only reason that I gave this a 2 was because unfortunately I've been to a worse Walmart.
0 ||| I'm a huge Chipotle fan, but it has to be said: this is quite possibly the worst Chipotle I've been to.\n\nThey don't have Chipotle in my hometown, so you can bet your sweet ass that whenever I go to a place where there is one, I will plan my meals around it. Hell, I even plan several of my meals around having Chipotle, so that I can maximize my delicious burrito-bowl eating opportunities. That being said, shortly after landing in Madison, of all the places, this HAD to be my first stop. \n\nIt sucked. \n\nThe workers here are more grouchier than your typical chipotle employee. You literally have 5 seconds to shout out your order before the workers give you a look so disdainful you might think you just kicked a basket full of baby kittens. Ugh, the pressure! Not to mention they scoop out your food and throw it in the bowl with such force, it's no wonder that the food portion is so small! Most of it ends up outside of the bowl, and you're left with an order half the size of what you'd get at any other location.\n\nI get it, it's a college town, and no doubt most of the employees are college students. I've been there. Hell, I've even been asked to throw away used tissues at my part time jobs while I've been in college. Life isn't that bad, kids. It shouldn't be, especially at Chipotle.
0 ||| Called and ordered a large thin crust for delivery.  Was told 35 to 45 min.  That was ok.  After an hour I called back and was told that was for pick-up.  No.  In our 20 years of doing business with this Dominos we have always had delivery.  Finally the pizza arrived.  COLD.  Guess I will have to find a different delivery shop.
4 ||| This place has it all. Food is delicious and their selection is well catered to. \n\nCost wise it is sufficient if u especially like seafood. \nThe Restraunt has different ethic dishes in the asajn cuisine. So when in Vegas, get off the strip and try something in the surrounding areas.
0 ||| This Trader Joe's is far closer to my house than the one on Decatur, but I actually favor the Decatur location. This one is smaller, with narrower aisles and it feels like the customers are coming in right off the freeway and polluting the act of grocery shopping with residual driving anger. This is especially noticable in the alcohol aisles, which have the crappiest layout and are always zones of passive aggro. \n\nThat sucks because short of installing a zen garden, you don't really know what TJ's could do to cheer the place up. I mean, Trader Joe's is already a pretty zen minded buisness.
3 ||| Fair prices.  Consistent Octane rating.  I've never been inside.  Also I think this station is very busy so the premium my car burns always seems to go a little further on a tank from here.  Not sure why but I also always get 20 more miles out of a tank if I fill up here instead of getgo or costco.
4 ||| Everything about Atmosphere is great.  It's in a great location, it's in a really wonderful space, it's cool yet unpretentious inside, they have hip stylists, good music, and local art on the walls.  They have good coffee and they put cucumber in their water which is just brilliant and I now do this sometimes at home.  They are a Paul Mitchell Salon and I've never had a bad haircut or rude stylist.  Prices are reasonable, and you can get your brows done while your hair is washed, and they have a nail tech who does really wonderful gels.\n\nMy one and only beef with Atmosphere, and the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5, is because I have never, in probably 15 visits, been able to get the same stylist twice.  Every time I've called back, the stylist I saw before is gone.  Maybe it's just a high turnover business?  After a brief hiatus, I tried them again last night, and really liked the new girl I got.  She said she's been there for 9 months and has no plans on going anywhere, so hopefully this one will stick.  Because I adore you Atmosphere, I really do.
0 ||| Really disappointing food. The service was slow but polite. \n\nIt seemed very inefficient to have four different servers attending to the same small area - but even worse was that only the one assigned to us would actually acknowledge us, so we ended up waiting for every little thing. \n\nFor the food, my companion had chicken parm, which was ok but not flavorful at all. It didn't even come with pasta. I had a Greek salad that was barely edible - overcooked, dry chicken, wilting lettuce, and huge chunks of unripe tomato and cucumber and onion. All the veggies were in enormous pieces that had to be cut several times to fit inside a mouth. The 'Italian' dressing was just a plastic cup of oil with some giardiniera in it. \n\nWe only drank water, but the meal still cost $35. Ridiculous for a basic chicken dish and an old salad. Will not go back.
1 ||| Yummy Olive Garden! I always enjoy their soup, breadsticks, and pasta dishes. Tonight I got the chicken parmigiana and pasta e fagioli. Everything was great. Our server was very soft spoken so it was hard to hear him, but he was still a good server so it was ok. He brought us Andes mints with my to go box, as well as with the check! Love those things! We also got a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go. We have yet to eat it, but I'm sure it will be tasty. The biggest downfall of Olive Garden is it can be kind of noisy since there's usually a lot of people there with their families. Tonight there was a child screeching at the top of his/her lungs that we could hear from across the restaurant. But did the parents ever take him/her outside? No, of course not! Some people just don't give any thought to anyone else and it's unfortunate. I was told that the location on Bell Rd has little tablets at the tables that you can order/pay on now. Wish this one had those! I think that's totally awesome.\n***\nUPDATE: I have to revise my review after heating up my leftovers. Something was wrong with the chicken parm... The meat was tough to cut and when I took a bite, I spit it out. It was inedible. I don't know what it was but it was nothing like the piece of chicken I ate for dinner. It was absolute junk... like processed tendons. I wish I had tried that piece when we were at the restaurant so I could have asked for a new one. So disappointing. Because of this, I have to drop the rating from 4 stars to 2.
4 ||| Dive bar.  $2 draft beers.  Need I say more?
1 ||| Meh. This is not my kind of place. The food always seems oily or greasy and doesn't taste that good. Plus they have yellow fried rice. That is a big NO NO for me. It is kind of like mushed cardboard. I don't like it at all. I haven't eaten here in a while and i don't think i will start anytime soon.
3 ||| Great pizza, and salad
3 ||| While I can't yelp but think that the music, decoration, and overall ambiance of Amel's is pure tacky cheese, their food continues to deliver anyways. The one way parking lot both in the front and rear of the building starts the meal with more frustration than delight.  The outside condition of the restaurant and other buildings surrounding it also don't bode well.\n\nThe first \"seat yourself\" table we sat at was bussed, and reset for dinner, it was also dirty.  They didn't replace the white paper, and there was some type of food smeared on the corner. We moved.\n\nThe service was generally good but the upsell was present in every breathe. It gets old because you are already plunking down a wad of hard earned cash.  The suggestions were good ones.\n\nThe hummus sampler was very good with the grilled lamb/pomegranate being very tasty!\n \nThe Amel's salad of greens with lemon/mint dressing was good.  The upsell of feta was a good idea.  Why they don't just include it and increase the price for the salad, I'm not sure.  It would have lacked something without the feta.  There's a freshness of herbs in the salad -- it was a great start.\n\nI had the mixed grille kabob --- (2) pieces lamb, (1) filet, (1) chicken (1) shrimp, (2) tomatoes, (1) piece of onion.  While admittedly I am a big guy, I could have eaten two of these.  The amount of food was too little given the price tag.  I can get a full 1/2 pound filet kabob at Giant Eagle for about $5. Or mixed Filet/Chicken for $5. Compare this to the $21.00 charged for essentially the same thing.  It was flavorful, but just questionable value.\n\nI think that if they threw on another shrimp to keep the other one company, and perhaps another piece of chicken, and charged $25 I would have been happier.\n\nMy wife's pasta athena with chicken was very good as well.\n\nWhile the service is a bit cheeky for me, and the ambiance definitely shaky, the food overcomes the majority of my concerns.  The value is semi-questionable.  They definitely deliver on flavor, and I'm rounding up to 4 for Amel's.
3 ||| Good but not as good as the Raymond Road location.
2 ||| I mean, it's Taco Bell. Not much to say.\nThis building is very outdated, definitely needs an update. The food is alright, I haven't had any issues with the ordering. They aren't very busy though, so I think the workers could be nicer.
3 ||| This is the first time at this location it's a cute little resturant the foods not bad. It's a bit pricey for food that is just ok the portions are good size and the pies are great but I'd go here just for the pies not to eat anything else.
3 ||| I love Dairy Queens and \"have never met one that I didn't like\" but this one comes close. It is dirty. The windows are gross. The landscaping needs lots of attention. They turn off the Pepsi machine so you can't get a refill. This store needs lots of attention.
1 ||| I have taken the Sun City Express shuttle dozens of times.   They recently had an ownership change and have doubled their rates.   This offends me.  \n\nUber car is now cheaper (especially when you have two or more).  No more Sun City Express shuttle for me unless I am desperate.
2 ||| i don't get it.  the first impression upon walking in is good: full of cantonese families, and it is a huge place that is completely full.  i expected big things with so many glowing reviews from  californians.  i don't even have  california standards.  i have midwest dim sum standards which is really low.\n\nnothing is quite like i expect.  the tapioca wrapper that they use is not good.  too thick thereby ruining the har kow, fun guo, scallop dumplings, etc.  the pork rib is good but overpowered by sesame oil.  siu mai and sinh juk guen (fried/steamed bean curd wrapper filled with goodies) were fine but nothing spectacular.  the haam sui gok (fried glutinous rice filled with goodies) was the highlight as it was freshly fried and the filling was correct.\n\nthe variety is okay; hopefully they just ran out of some of the more common items we were looking for: egg tart, dofu fa, taro puff.\n\ni don't get phoenix.  there are a ton of chinese people, chinese groceries are cheap and plentiful, lots of demand for chinese food.  why isn't it better here?  to be fair china king in chandler was decent when i went a year ago.
3 ||| Open 10:30 to 2:30, so lunch is your only option here.   I would bet this place is really busy during lunch time, because I was here at 10:45 and there was already steady traffic coming in.    \n\nMmmm Japanese food.  I had the Kobe beef bowl, and spicy shrimp rolls.  The Kobe was better than I expected for 6 bucks, and I really liked the spicy shrimp rolls, kind of on the small side but fresh and just spicy enough.   The menu looks pretty good from the pictures on the wall so I'll go back and try a few more items when I get a chance and don't see a line out the door.
1 ||| There are absolutely no mills here, that is false advertising.\n\nThis is a building much larger than any building should be, filled with stores much larger than any store should be, and patrolled by humans much larger than any human should be. A mall with a Ross. The stores are filled with garbage, the food in the food court is from the garbage, etc. You know the deal.\n\nI saw a female here whose shorts were so tight they gave her pot belly some cleavage. That last sentence was not an exaggeration. The clientele here are fascinatingly ugly. Again, a mall with a Ross.\n\nBut they got an IMAX and a GameWorks here, so at least they got that going for them.
3 ||| Came with the family of 5 for lunch on Sunday. All of the food was good. I had the dry rub ribs and was probably the one item I would less likely try again. The ribs were cooked to perfection but the rub lacked flavor. I had the homemade beans and  Mac and cheese, both were delicious! My daughter had the wet ribs and only shared a single bite (don't blame her a bit). They were also done to perfection and the sauce had more flavor. Wife had the pulled pork and was impressed. She grew up near Lexington, NC so she knows her BBQ. I was also allowed only a single bite and was also very impressed. They offer several sauces at the table and each had a very unique flavor. Service was good, glassed stayed full and bill came at the correct time. I found that the amt was kinda high for all lunch entree's when 2 of the meals were kids meals. The total without tip was $48.00. Worth a try and I will return when in the area.
3 ||| Oh, laundromats. How you take me back to my days in college and grad school. Though I've been fortunate to have in-home laundry capabilities everywhere I've lived over the last several years, recently I found myself in need of professional (laundry) help when my dog puked all over our comforter and mattress pad (thanks again for that, little buddy). Our washer was too small to do the job, so off I went to the Laundry Factory.\n\nLike I said, it's been awhile since I've been to a laundromat, so I don't know what other laundromats are like these days, but wow, this one was wayyyy nicer than the ones I used to go to back in the day! It was modern, clean, bright, and had tons of well-kept machines. No dank corners where sketchy people loitered, no broken machines, no weird funky old sneaker smells. \n\nThey had several sizes of machines to choose from, ranging from average (a regular household laundry machine) to mega-capacity. I chose the \"large load\" machine, which fit our comforter and mattress pad just fine. A load in the large capacity machine cost $6.00, which seemed a little steep, but not too bad. Other machines ranged in price from $2.75 to $10.00 (super mega capacity machine). They also have super capacity (50 lb.) dryers, which was very handy. It was $.50 for the first 5 minutes of drying time, and then $.25 for every 4 minutes after that. Again, seemed a little steep, but the dryers were very efficient -- I think it took only about 15 minutes (on low heat, no less) to dry my bulky items.\n\nThey had well-stocked change machines and a nice little lounge to wait in. I didn't see any bathrooms, so good thing I refrained from going to the beer store next door to have a cold one while I waited.\n\nThey do have a parking lot, but it's really small and packed, so you'll probably only get a spot if you're lucky. So plan to either park on the street or behind the building (I found plenty of space behind the building and wasn't ticketed or towed).\n\nAnyhow, next time I need to use a large capacity washing machine (which I hope is NEVER -- hint hint, my little doggie friend), I will not hesitate to come back here.
2 ||| My roommate and I ended up here last night when we wanted a meal that wasn't fast food at like 1am.  Beano's is one of the few local bars that serves food 24 hours.  Prices were great, with hardly a menu item over $10, but the food was pretty average.  The place wasn't really anything too memorable, but if I find myself hungry at that hour again, I would probably stop in again.  Meh.
1 ||| Trying to understand why chicken on half order of nachos costs as much as on full order? Miguel, manager of the kitchen on North Hayden , reassured me that it is EXACTLY the same amount as it is on the full order....what? You be the judge...
0 ||| I didn't want to write a review for this place because my husband loves it and I love my husband. However after a recent dose of South Asian food in New York we believe that Phoenix has a lot of catching-up to do. The more we condone the production of greasy fare on dirty plates the more we fall behind. Pull up your socks buddies because soon my newly educated husband will also fall off your patron-list!
4 ||| Discount Tire is the ONLY place I will EVER get tires!!  I only wish I could give more stars.   Fast and friendly service.  Very knowledgeable staff that goes above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.  No pressure to buy more than you can afford.  They helped me stay within budget and when I got a flat, it was replaced for free.  That replacement coverage is priceless.
2 ||| The good: bartenders, \"ziparitas\", certain food items.\n\nThe average: most of the food (let's be honest though, what do you expect out of bar food?), the wait service, tap beer selection.\n\nThe bad: management: god forbid you have one drink too many here, bar area can get crowded, just has an \"up tight\" feel at times.
2 ||| I go with three stars because the co-owner, Lisa, did a lovely updo for me for a wedding. People commented on my hair and I was pleased with the results. However, I had less than stellar experience with getting my makeup done with airbrush. Not only did the woman give my sister-in-law attitude on her wedding day because she didn't like how her make up was looking, she also spilled the liquid formula all over my white button down shirt.  She was apologetic but considering her work on my face did little to nothing to cover up my blemishes, I would not recommend getting make up done by her.
4 ||| They have the BEST carwash I have ever used - only $7!!  I just arrived yesterday, driving 2,500 miles from VA Beach and this wash got it looking better than my old favorite back home.
4 ||| Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.\n\nThe bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\n\nI'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.
0 ||| Charlie's is truly a despicable establishment. They are sexist and will steal your money.
3 ||| Just searched on yelp and went there with friends. The food was really nice. Liked the chicken makhani that I ordered, my friend ordered paneer masala and it was yummy ! They charge you $0.99 per bowl of rice, but definitely worth it , it had a great taste !! Overall very satisfied with the food, the service could have been better due to which I am going for 4/5
0 ||| Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous.
4 ||| With several Middle Eastern friends, I get a little picky because I get homemade food. Byblos was recommended to my boyfriend and me by a gentleman in Changing Hands who overheard me saying I missed our friend's hummus (they moved back to Israel), so we decided to check it out, and we were so happy we did!\n\nThe older gentleman who served us had a lovely accent and demeanor, and he was very helpful with choosing appetizers and entrees. The decore is a little sparse I suppose, but the food makes up for it. We had the hummus and shish-kabobs that were delicious. The hummus was as close as we've found to our Israeli friend's, so needless to say that would have been enough to captivate our senses.\n\nWe will definitely be going back!
2 ||| Went through the drive through for some breakfast. First thing I was greeted with was a very unfriendly staff, not even hello. The young lady never even smiled! Seems like she just hates her job, or me. Anyways, I ordered 2 breakfast burritos, one with no cheese. The speed of gettin the food was good and they got my order correct, which surprised me cause they have always gotten it wrong. The burritos Tasted ok, not highly recommended.
4 ||| I came in today with my daughter, I had a gel manicure, and my daughter had a polish change. Everyone was super friendly and we did not have to wait long. My daughter's polish change was done first, I do not remember the technician's name, but she was very friendly and patient. My daughter  is only 5 years old, so she doesn't necessarily sit still for long. The polish cahnge was great, even with my daughter's tiny fingers, they were still painted neatly, and filed well. My gel manicure was awesome. I am super picky with my nails, and Stephanie did a great job. It has been a long time since I've had such nice work done. The gel was applied neatly, none of it got stuck to my skin. It is nice and smoothe like it's supposed to be, no ripples or bubbles. They are perfect... And my cuticles were clipped and pushed well, no bleeding or soreness! I will be back, I'm so happy I found this place.
4 ||| I'm kind of surprised that this place has gotten such low reviews, and I can only assume that their game must have come up quite a bit since some of these.\n\nI normally wouldn't review a fast food chain but this place is clean, quiet and I've never had an issue.  I actually drive an extra couple of minutes to go to this location rather than the one down on Glendale Ave.\n\nAlso, let me just say, YOU HAVE TO TRY THE NEW BREAKFAST!  I love a good chicken biscuit, and the one they serve has got honey butter on it as well.  Wendys has really upped the ante for breakfast fast food.  Try it out, you'll love it!!!!
4 ||| I have been a 'Trek' guy for many years, one of the reasons is the great service and customized help I receive at BR. Have purchased both road bikes and mountain and more recently 'upgraded' my daughters bikes for christmas. When I received the call that my girls bikes were in, BR went the extra mile and made sure I picked up before they closed the day before Christmas and the 'store next to target' as not to give 'Santa' away. Little things like that are very much appreciated. The service has been great, always helpful and willing to fit in some 'minor' adjustments on the fly. Can't say enough about having a local owned bike shop that I enjoy stopping in!
3 ||| The food here is the best and service is good. One problem is that the place needs a cleaning. All the tables were dirty the fridge where the large bottles of water are located the glass was filthy. The trash was over flowing and the young girl behind the counter is texting messages instead of cleaning the place. What a five star place this restaurant could be if only they would use some soap and water. But we still loved the food and the price is right.
1 ||| This is my second time ever to a strip club. I'm not a huge fan of strip clubs and the only reason I even went was my sister's bachelorette.\n\nSo here's the deal. It's a Saturday night, during 4th of July weekend. I was deciding between Men of Sapphire and Olympic Garden (friend is friends with a Manager). My contact at MOS said their male strippers sometime leave early on weekends (WTF?!) and since my friend recommended OG, I said sure. Mistake Number 1.\n\nIt was BAD. The strippers themselves were fine (not good looking, just good at their job). The place itself looked like SHIT. Bare walls and shitty carpet. Maybe I was too sober. So we try to solve that problem by ordering bottle service. Mistake Number 2.\n\nWe ordered Belvedere and OG had some special where we got a free bottle of Smirnoff. So typically, I don't get bottle service but apparently your host/hostess usually shows you the bottle before opening it. Well the geniuses at OG opened our bottle while we were getting our lap dances so they could later blame us for not looking at the bottle before they opened it. After my dance, I took a sip of my pre- mixed vodka/cran and it tasted like crap. I'm no \"vodka connosieur\" but i know what good vodka tastes like, even when its in a mixed drink. Long story short, we had a fit and the jackass bartender told us it was real belvedere. He wouldnt even take a swig of the \"belvedere\" to prove to us it was real.\n\nThank god we had a lawyer with us. Eff you OG!
0 ||| Highly disappointing. While sandwich is unique it was totally over cooked and under seasoned. No flavor
0 ||| I just went here with my daughter.  It got good reviews from everyone, so figured I would give it a try.  I was especially excited when I heard it had a good chili rellano burrito.   So that's what I got, and Megan got a carne asada quesadilla.  First, the help.  I stood there for at least 3 minutes, no one at the counter, and the people in the back just looked at me.  Finally, someone came up to help me.  Towards the end of my order, her personal cell phone rang.  And I kid you not, while she was waiting on a customer, she answered it and began to talk.  I couldn't believe it.  But I figured if the food was good, we would give it a try anyway.  So we went to find a table.  We sat down and I was afraid the wobbly chair under me was going to collapse.  I moved twice before I felt comfortable.  That's a lawsuit waiting to happen.   In the meantime, helped myself to the salsa bar, which isn't bad, give that 3 stars.  The food came out in a timely manner.  My chili rellano burrito had rice in it.  Now, I don't like rice in my burritos, but that's also easy to overlook.  But the rice had PEAS in it.  I kid you not, PEAS, and lots of them.  I hate peas, hate them.  So as I begin to eat, I picked them out, one by one.  The egg coating on the rellano seemed like it was hours old, it was spongy, greasy,  so peeled most of that off too.  And it was very hot, obviously had been heated up in a microwave.    Megan's carne asada quesadilla wasn't too bad, but the meat also seemed like it had been sitting around for quite a while.  All in all, a horrible experience.  There's a Taco Bell right next door.  I would have preferred that, any day of the week.  Needless to say, someone could buy my dinner for me and I wouldn't go back to this nasty ass place.  Rude front counter people, old nasty food, and chairs in the dining room that are ready to collapse.  It was clean...I guess that's something.
0 ||| There must be some mistake. \n\nAm I on hidden camera? The menu says that a small coffee is $2.40, with an in-house refill of $1.40. I assume this is my fault, I must just be missing the fine print that says every cup comes with a free indentured servant, or is delivered on the back of a domesticated cheetah. And I assume that the \"small chocolate milk\" for $3.75 comes in at least a half-gallon sized cup, since I can buy a gallon of delicious Oberweis chocolate milk for less than that at the grocery store. One chocolate Big Gulp, please!\n\nMy complaints with the service, too, are all my fault. Why must I insist on employees who acknowledge my existence? It's so petty of me. And my obsession with tables that aren't covered in trash is really getting embarrassing. Yet, I persist, constantly interrupting the baristas' conversations to ask them to get me some coffee, or inconsiderately wiping the tables that have been lovingly encrusted in grime. \n\nWhat's my deal? Clearly, I don't deserve to go here anymore. So, you know... I won't.
2 ||| I'm from Sacramento, CA so when we were in Vegas we were really craving for some authentic Viet food.  This place will satisfy your cravings but the service was horrible!!!  Upon arrival the waiter spilled 2 glasses of water on my friend.  They were very rude when we asked questions about the portion size of the pho.  We also asked for change so we can all pay the bill separately and they were really rude about that!  \n\nThere's so many other Thai & Viet restaurants in the same plaza so if I were to go back to Vegas and wanted some authentic Asian food I would not go back to this place.  I'd try another restaurant in the same plaza.  As a matter of fact, we went to the Kung Fu restaurant on the corner of this plaza and they serve Chinese & Thai food and the food was great & service was good as well.
1 ||| Service: 2.5 stars (out of 5)\nFood: 2.5 stars\nPrice: 4 stars (easily under $10/person)\nAtmosphere: 1 stars (unless you like shouting and being cold)\n\nA number of people have said that this a great place for college students to get decent cheap food. I completely concur. My low marks come from the fact that I don't want food that is just \"decent\" or \"cheap\". I want it to be tasty and I'm willing to pay for that! Also, it felt like a college cafeteria: the stereo was loudly playing poppy dance, hip-hop, and rock songs. So I'm getting a whole bunch of pop lyrics layered with everyone around me shouting over the music. I could barely hear my wife right across the table. There seemed to be a cool breeze blowing across my legs from somewhere. Perhaps it was from the 8 inch hole in the wall behind us. \n\nThe food was greasy, yet satisfying. The white rice was a bit chewier than I like it. At least the tea was tasty and stayed nice and hot.
4 ||| Oh, Popo's....  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways!  having lived in the area for more than 20 years, Popo's has been and likely will always be the best mexican food around.  We worried heavily when they opened their new location at 59th and Bell because it can often signal the beginning of the end (such was the case with Garcia's).  \n\nPopo's is a family restaraunt.  A bit rough on the edges with the decor but the food and service are far more worthy of a visit than any decor.  I often look intently at the menu hoping that I would find something that could sway me from my usual choice but I somehow always seem to default to the Chimi dinner.  Sure I would love to try other items but I feel as though I would miss the chimi just a little more.  So, for me it's the chimi dinner with machaca, red sauce, guacamole, and their delicious jalapeno cream cheese.  The machaca (shredded beef) is absolutely amazing and if I could make it myself I would never have to venture out again.  Add to that their salsa (which has the right amount of saltyness and that addictive red hot sauce and you will be set for an incredibly filling and delicious meal.  \n\nThe service is exceptional.  Like family really.  The beer is cold and the drink specials are always fun.  We have always had a great time and look forward to each visit.  We have tried many other Mexican places over the years but this place takes the blue ribbon.\n\nIncidentally, we have a home in Texas as well and our Mexican food experiences there have been less than spectacular.  The TexMex - Fresh Mex idea is a completely different type of dining and it lacks the depth of flavor and preparation that Popo's is expert at.  \n\nFor a south of the border treat, check it out and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!
0 ||| Since moving to Glendale I have rarely encountered rude business owners, especially during economic downtimes. Apparently the owner (or at least who I'm guessing is the owner) of this establishment (stocky bald guy) doesn't care about his customers. We came in with some local med students, and being students we asked for the cashier to split up the bill. He came over apparently upset and made a snide comment. The pizza wasn't even close to Chicago style deep dish, but whatever enjoyment the food might have offered was soured by the poor management. Definitely do not recommend!
0 ||| There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders. \nThe fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago. \nThe Mussels were OK. \nBut the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. \nThe New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. \nNo, we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill.
1 ||| I cannot for the life of me figure out why I keep coming back to Yong's. I have NEVER arrived on the day and time my items are supposed to be done and been able to pick them up. Always an apology and a request to come back tomorrow. About half the time they screw up the work, doing careless things like sewing on patches way off center and crooked, misspelling embroidery, or forgetting portions of work. They also take FOREVER! I recently dropped off a single pair of pants that needed a hem repair on one leg where the original thread had snagged and come out. They said it would be a week.  We are talking about 90 seconds worth of work to those who are skilled at such things, so it shouldn't really take that long, but whatever.  Then I go pick them up, and they have not lined up the hem correctly so it is a bubbly break instead of a crisp one.  They also unhemmed and rehemmed the other leg that had been fine when I brought the pants in, but is now bubbly as well.  The pants do not look good and I am looking for another place to have them fixed.\n\nI think there are some major organization issues here, as the place is always a disaster and I think the reason they don't get things done is because they can't keep track of it all. Still, as inept as they are, everyone working here is extremely friendly and they are sincerely apologetic when something goes wrong.
0 ||| I can't tell if the previous reviewers have never shopped there, or were perhaps reviewing the wrong location. I've shopped at many other Copps locations before and have had no problems whatsoever. This Fitchburg location, however, is abysmal to say the least. Why, you ask? Where should I begin? \n\nThe \"Customer Service\" counter? Empty. On the rare occasion there is someone there, I've been told to wait just one second, while they leave the area completely and never return. I have honestly been wanting to buy lottery tickets from this Copps for the last year, and 9 times out of 10 there is no one there to help you. \n\nThe seafood area? Desolate. There is NEVER anyone at the seafood area to help you. There is also no bell to ring in the seafood area for service. The only bell is in the meat section. Which brings me to my next gripe: The meat section. There is NEVER anyone in the meat department. You wait (with about 3 or 4 other guests for 5 minutes before someone rings the bell for seafood from the meat department.\n\nOne more tidbit before I end this. Fairly important, indeed. Self checkout? No one is there. Other companies have one employee dedicated to the self checkout area, making it easy to get help when the computer has a problem. This branch, however, has random baggers running over to punch in codes then running away to bag again. It takes way too long to get help. I actually feel sorry for the employees, because this is clearly a management issue.\n\nOverall, I can't even begin to estimate the amount of money this location loses per day by being understaffed and not attentive. If you want groceries, sure, they have groceries! If you're looking for any type of customer care, you will lose your mind shopping at the Fitchburg Copps.
1 ||| terrible
0 ||| I don't know why I continue to go here and expect things to change. I've had the pizza here once and it was great. Breakfast however is entirely different.  They can't cook eggs !!!  Always runny and under cooked. The place is usually freezing cold and I think the music is played so loudly that it will take your mind off your cold food. Really disappointed as I live only a block away.  They might want to send some of there cooks to the Breakfast Club for a refresher course.
4 ||| I have left a review before with 5 stars, because this is a 5-star church. However, this review is for another reason. The only negative thing I could ever say about Canyon Ridge, is that people are allowed to smoke outside of the doors, very close to the building. It is not my business that people choose to slowly kill themselves with this horrible, toxic addiction, but I, nor my child should have to be exposed to 2nd hand smoke that these people are giving off.  I just don't think it's fair. Hopefully in the very near future, there can be a designated smoking area away from Base Camp and the main auditorium. God bless!
0 ||| blah... it was just blaah... ugh - our server was tired and wasn't that attentative... she tried to apologize but she kinda just trailed off... lol. But I guess its okay, but THEN... there came in a white couple and all of a sudden our waitress sprang to life!!\n\nUhhh... okaaaay??\n\nAt first I thought, great now she'll be attentative... ummmm... no. no she wasn't. I know that the East side of town is racist... ugh, I don't wanna talk about the ASU Bookstore Incident... Good grief!! \n\nThis chick, I WISH I caught her name... was all smiles and giggles and then came to our table (which was only about 6 feet away) and was all frowns and excuses. It was sickening.\n\nShe failed to bring us our drinks, she only refiled them once and ignored us twice when we tried to ask for more water... okay the Iced Tea was too much for you... how impossible is water?? \n\nWe had enough and were ready to walk out on the check when; I guessed she sensed our frustration and brought it to the table early! *harsh sigh* \n\nWe paid in cash and got about $8 in change... which she brought to us in all ones!! omg, is she for real?? lol, I just laughed when I saw it... and I chose to leave a yelp card instead of any cash!
4 ||| I like this place; it single-handedly made me hate Pittsburgh just a little less.  In fact, this would be an easy 5 stars if it wasn't in Pittsburgh and therefore emblazoned with all manner of Steelers propaganda, and as a Browns fan I...I just can't do it.  I'm sorry.  The sandwiches were good and prepared with genuine care and attention to detail, the people were friendly and the prices reasonable.  Get the soft pretzels, toss 'em in the microwave and eat them with mustard.
3 ||| This is located in a big shopping plaza off the strip but not too far. Apparently there is many similar ones, not sure if they are all a chain. The wait time took awhile even on a Sunday night!\n\nThe pho quality is definitely up there and is pretty authentic. I could barely finish it. Other than that, it's a very typical pho place that fills your drunken needs. Service could be improved a bot but that's about my only gripe.
0 ||| You must remember you get what you pay for. It's like a tattoo artist say, a cheap tattoo is not good and a good tattoo is not cheap. \nCigarette burns on the sheet, pubic hair under the toilet seat, hair on the edge of the bath tub, ash trays all over the room (when I specifically asked for a non smoking room), the room smelled so badly of cigarette smoke, some one was smoking the medicinal cigarette around my room. The office smelled of cig smoke, the plug behind my lamp didn't work, my phone almost died, the bed is so close to the A/C unit and it was on full blast but didn't make the room cold at all. Slept ok, the bed was fine. My toe ended up poking through one of the cigarette burns in the comforter. No more again. I don't care about the price at this point.
4 ||| My family LOVED this place! The falafel pita and plate were amazing. Quick service and delicious food. We will definitely be coming back here!
3 ||| This was a hard one to review for me.\n\nFirst of all - FIVE BIG AWESOME STARS FOR THE FOOD!!!\n\nThis food is crazy delicious.  Like, just from one dish, I know all of the others are going to be on my most wanted list.\n\nEverything is fresh, and well prepared, and so frickin' TASTY.\n\nI would give more stars for the food.\n\nI came in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and had the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth green chile pork scrambled into eggs and cheese, with a wonderful chunky biscuit, Liberty potatoes (think chunky potato-au-gratin but better), and I added a blueberry, bacon pancake on the side.\n\nI could not have been more satisfied with the food.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe service system is not my style. I give it 2.5 stars. Barely.\nMostly because the awesomeness of the food should pair with some seriously awesome service.\n\nIn IHOP, I expect IHOP food and service, and one does not out-do the other.  \n\nBut here you get down-home local goodness, matched with so-so service. It just doesn't compute.\n\nYou walk in.  Wait in a line of about 15+ people with only 1 cash register (this just seemed unnecessary.  why can't i just sit down and someone take my order like every other not-that-great restaurant?), and then random people bring out your food, and random people wander around the dining area looking more interested in cleaning off tables, than on actually serving the diners.\n\nI had to ask like 3 \"dining room attendants\" for the same thing (just some salsa) before one of them actually returned after I'd basically finished.\nBut I had barely left my seat when they were already clearing off my dishes.\nThe service vibe just didn't go with the great food, decor and build up.\n\nI guess it's all about expectation.  If I'd read more reviews I would have known and maybe not have been so disappointed, but still.  This food DESERVES good service.\n\nDefinitely eat here, but don't expect personal dining service.
4 ||| Must say this is the best pizza I've tasted in the valley!\n\nWent here Friday night with my husband and we were in the mood for something naughty... we found it..     We ordered \"The Super Six Pizza\", which is sorta the combo they have....    As soon as I saw it I thought, Come here you little slice of heaven..spank, spank....     I think it was a little of everything that made this pizza for me...   The sauce was sweet and had a lot of tasty flavor.  The toppings were the perfect amount and you could actually taste all the different flavors of the meats while eating them.  The cheese was plentiful and the medium pizza for the two of us was more then enough.  You can really taste the love that was put into this pie.  I think it was the owner or chef, or both that came out and greeted everyone on the porch chit chatting with everyone to make it feel more homely.  \n**** Yes I think my search for a fabulous pizza is over with, I woke up the next morning craving it...  ****  Must return, and must return soon.
0 ||| Friends of ours invited us to meet them at this restaurant to celebrate a birthday.  Never having been there, I checked out their website, and found that it is one of a (small) chain of restaurants based in Chicago.  The menu looked interesting, and I tentatively chose an entree (Clams and Mussels alla Uncle Roy).  Upon arriving at the restaurant, I discovered that that dish was not on the menu.  I had chosen it because it was not tomato sauce or cream based.  The actual menu only has such main dishes.  In any case, I asked the waiter about the appetizer of  \"creamy mariniere\" musselson the menu.  He didn't know, or couldn't explain, what \"mariniere\" meant.  I guessed it was the standard dish, but boy was I wrong.  The mussels, very overcooked and chewy, came with a heavy tasteless cream sauce.  My main dish, the \"pescatore\" came with exactly the same cream sauce.  And the mussels were likewise overcooked, but the clams were cooked so much that they were simply paste.  Inedible.  The wine we chose, Penfold's Bin #2 Syrah-Mourv\u00e8dre (a $10 bottle in the supermarkets), was priced at $30, an exhorbitant markup.  Nothing to recommend this restaurant -- oh, and did I mention the gruff and unhelpful waiter?
3 ||| Great even for lunch!\n\nBrought my grandmother here for a beautiful birthday lunch. The crab salad croissant was absolutely amazing! It was not very busy when we went but then again it was 1pm on a Monday. It is so nice and peaceful to dine in the open air with a view of the lake. I saw an advertisement for live flamenco guitar on certain evenings. I would love to go back for that. \n\nThe only issue was the hostess was very rude and did not even acknowledge us when we walked in. The phone was ringing and she made that a priority even though she made eye contact with us. Then she began to freak out over some scheduling issue with the person on the phone. It is not life and death, lady. It would have been nice not to see that happen.
3 ||| Good chips, decent service.  Overall the food wasn't very good except for a little pile of sweet corn tamale mash that should be highlighted rather than underplayed....as it was the best thing there!  Well, the steak fajita nachos were ok too.  They didn't mind kids being a little rowdy and the tortilla machine was cute.  I'll come back with kids.  But only if I can have a margarita next time.
0 ||| Purchased $12.99 car wash, inside was filthy going in and worse when I got it after the wash. There was more dust inside and the outside was just as bad. First when I arrived the sales guy was mad that I purchased only a $12.99 wash and kept pushing and pushing for me to do upgrades. Said for $3 more I could get tires done, I said no, another $2 upgrade and you get something else and so on. I was ready to give him $5 to leave me alone. \n\nI asked the guy working at the end if he could take a sticker off and he said no.  I looked confused and he said if you get it detailed for $150 or so he would take it off.  I took it home, spent 3 minutes putting goo gone and it removed it.  \n\nI ended up bringing the car home and rewashing it by hand, including the inside.  \n\nI will never be taking my car to this wash again and should have believed all the previous responses by Yelp which were so true.
0 ||| I gotta share something with you other yelpers.  My late wife always used to tell me this, but being the non-learner that I am, I have not listened.....but on Friday, I went to have some lunch here with a friend.  The food was OK again -- not great, not bad, but acceptable as Cantonese food goes.  But I also wanted a whole roasted duck and about 2# of roast pork so I ordered that too and asked them to cut that up and just put it into take home containers for me.  But I what I did not do, which I should have done, is go to the deli counter and watch what they were doing.  They gave me the driest, oldest duck they had and the burnt and fatty piece of roast pork.  My wife always told me that Chinese restaurants are notorious for doing crap like that, and she should know being Chinese herself.  I must always remind myself to remember that and always remember to listen to the advice of my wife!!!  These places always give the crap stuff to unsuspecting customers.  I should have know better -- my bad!!
1 ||| Have been to several Red Robins in the past, and been generally happy with them, but tonight's experience was an exception.\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant it was not busy at all, there were only 7 tables of diners, and about 9 servers working.  We were promptly seated and the first of several servers came to our table.  Now I don't mind when restaurants are training new staff, but when you're training, keep an eye on what's going on.  The whole dinner was like the keystone kops with this server taking our order, then the very next server asking if we'd like to order, with another server trying to handle their reward card services.  It was crazy.\n\nAnother thing that annoys me is that when you ask if we're members of your loyalty club, pay attention!  After being asked four times if I was a member one of the servers finally took my membership number to check my account.  Of course since I set my account up the day previously, the restaurant could not access my newly created account.  However, they did honor my birthday burger offer even though they couldn't access my account.  \n\nWe ordered a raspberry shake first since my wife had a reward offer for a free shake and it was terrific!  I highly recommend their shakes!  We also ordered 2 cokes that were mostly ice, however refills are free...it just takes a long time to get the refill once your glass is empty.\n\nWe ordered 2 bowls of the french onion soup and an order of pretzel bites.  We received 2 CUPS of the soup with the pretzel bites.  Oh well, not a big deal, and cheaper anyways.  Soup was okay, but nothing special.  The pretzel bites were awful, definitely skip them as they were a huge let-down.  Basically flavorless oily dough balls with watery cheese sauce - yuck!\n\nAlso, we were served our food with no utensils (except spoons) and no napkins.  As my wife and I are sitting at the table with oily hands from the pretzel bites looking for the napkins, she grabbed a couple out of her purse for us to use!  Another fail.\n\nWe each ordered the bacon cheeseburgers, mine plain and medium, my wife's thru the garden and done.  We waited...and waited...and waited for the burgers.  My wife said that there was a lot of food orders under the heat lamps in the kitchen, and when I turned around I could see quite a few dinners waiting on the line.  With 7 tables being utilized and 9 servers food should not be waiting to be brought out.\n\nOf course when our burgers arrived our fries were cold and our burgers were warm.  Had my burger not been free, I would have sent ours back to the kitchen, but I was hungry and just wanted to eat.  The burgers were very flavorful, but of course I got the done burger and my wife got the medium...another fail.\n\nAlso, don't most restaurants clean before or after being open?  I have a problem when I'm waiting for my NOW COLD food and three servers are breaking a bar down to dust and cleaning the walls and light fixtures.  Can't that be done when it's not going to rain dust down on me, my table, and MY FOOD!  Good grief!  Howbout instead of cleaning, the servers oh, I don't know, SERVE THE FOOD, CLEAR THE TABLES, AND REFILL DRINKS!\n\nAnyways, I got the bill, and of course it was wrong.  I had to remind the server that the shake was a free one.  She was able to correct the problem quickly and we paid and left.\n\nI can say that I will NOT be going back to this Red Robin, and I'm also going to answer their survey right now.
4 ||| She is the best! There is a wait, but she is well worth it. Dr.Boyd always gives her patients the attention and care that they need(that's why there is a wait). If you want a quick in and out where the doctor doesn't even know your name, she's not the place to go. If you want a warm doctor who you feel comfortable addressing all your concerns with, this is the place. She becomes a partner in your health care, and truly takes her patients needs into consideration.
4 ||| First time at this Mesa, AZ Applebees. Wonderful service, thanks Kailani! My moms salad was made just right and my chicken tenders and fries were perfect. We splurged and had the triple chocolate melt desert. Wow! Loved it! I'm from Charleston, SC and I will be backi to this Mesa Applebees when I come to visit!
1 ||| I've done the tubing thing twice.  Each time, the rocks and trees kick my a$$.  But you get nice color, or a serious burn, and if you survive it, it can be fun.  On a day when people might not venture out to the river, it's peaceful and the nature you see is plentiful.  On the Fourth of July, hang on to your hat....and pants....and tubes...and keys.  \n\nI actually held about 6 water bottles worth of liquid from point 1 to the end point 4, but most people urinate on themselves.  It's not a \"high brow\" activity, but it's an experience and the cool water vs. the hot day is a good contrast.\n\nJust remember, it's a real river with real rapids and real undertows.  You can really get hurt, even if you are a star swimmer.  Don't go it alone.\n\nIn terms of a family affair, I heard the f-bomb at least 20 times.  Most everyone was covered with tats and many were reminiscing about the time they were \"locked up\".  And the average age of people there when I visited was probably 21.  Not something I'd take junior to do.
2 ||| some friends from indy came into town and i figured this would be the tourist portion of their trip.  it's $4 round trip and we were pleasantly surprized that there was no line (it was 4th of July weekend).  the ride was short and the views up top weren't as incredible as i'd hoped for.  \n\ni think i set my expectations too high with the yelp.com reviews.  i just thought it would be quicker, easier, funner, cheaper to hike up the hill instead of taking this thing.  \n\nparking was also a joke.  the lot across the street was charging $20.  the reason for this $20 may have been due to it being the 4th of July and people were coming out to see the fireworks.  i'm not sure.  i refused to pay the $20 and backed up stopping traffic in both directions.  the lady in the truck behind me who was also entering the parking lot yelled \"what's wrong\"  \ni yelled \"it's $20\"  \nshe said \"what's the problem\"  \ni said \"IT'S $20 FREAK'N BUCKS!  BACK UP!!!!  I'M COMING OUT!!!!!!!!!
1 ||| Not a great grooming department & customer service stinks.\n\nFirstly, I called to make an appointment at  the grooming department about 2 weeks in advance and ask that the main groomer tend to my cat because this would be his first time at the groomers. They agreed and I set up the appointment. Upon entering the grooming area the groomers were all outside smoking and no one was at the desk. I waited for about 15 minutes and then I went outside and asked to speak to someone regarding getting my cat groomed.\n\nAfter they came in we discussed grooming and agreed on getting him an oatmeal bath, nail clipping, and trim. I had asked that he recieved a lion cut due to the Vegas heat. \n\nI was quoted an hour for the entire service so I was excited about the time due to the  fact I would be able to pick up groceries while he was being pampered. But before I left I noticed that here was some non-needed loud dryers going on in the back room (which had no animals in it). I asked that they only use the dryers when needed due to the fact that he is scared of loud noises, they ignored my request and tried to take him to the back. He of course would have none of that and they had to turn them off anyway.\n\nWhen I arrived back to pick him up he was just then getting dried. Another hour later they said he was done (2 1/2 hrs so far). They put him in his carrier before I saw him so I assumed he was done as we had discussed, payed them a pretty penny for the work, and went home. When I got home and took him our of the carrier I found that half of the agreed upon services were not completed. He had no lion cut, had danrif all on his fur, and his nails had been jaggly done. Needless to say I will not use their grooming services again.\n\nIn addition to the bad grooming services, this Petco has awful customer service in store. The cashiers are rarely avaliable up front and if you have questions or need anything you have to wonder around the store for some time to find someone. I personally refrain from going to Petco and instead reccomend Petsmart.
2 ||| 20 minutes late with an order I put in almost 2 hours ago.  Staff are very nice and gave me a coupon for $5 off next visit.  This is a common problem with them, so you need to pad whatever time they tell you by 20-30 min.  If you need pizza in a hurry for guests, better off with Pizza Hut or other chain
0 ||| Ordered the Chicken Piccata which is supposed to come with the chicken, potatoes and fresh veggies. The veggies never made the plate. In addition, they don't have Jack Daniels - apparently corporate decided not to carry it and to go with Jim Beam. Seriously, who doesn't have jack? \n\nThe food is poor quality. It reminds me of a cracker barrel.
1 ||| i'm going halfway here. like the reviewer before me, our home warranty assigned them to us (we had another company come out 2x's, then lee collins 3 times....all this during the 115degree heat wave a few weeks back....no a/c!). first time they came out, said there was nothing wrong and filled freon and left. in 10 minutes, only hot air again. \n\nwe called back, said they would come back in the morning. they did, nothing fixed. i called back. said they'd be there the next day b/t 4-6pm. never showed up. i bitched and moaned and so they came again the next morning, 8am. FINALLY found the problem....broken fan motor. fixed it, it's cool again. \n\ni know nothing about a/c repair. seems like a broken motor would be easy to spot, but like i said....now they have to come back to turn some switch back so we get heat in the winter. i've called to get that done...we'll see.....\n\n5 stars for ken, the president, who came out himself to fix it. 2 stars for the initial hassle of not getting it repaired and one of the service reps for not even showing up.
4 ||| Came here for a boxing event and had a blast. I've been to many events here over the years and always had a great time!
4 ||| Love their corned beef and cabbage on wed. nights.
4 ||| Not a huge fan of this chain but this particular location has a lot going for it! First, the service is always very good- they are extra friendly here. Second, we visit for lunch, and my Wife works at Chase bank nearby, so we are always sort of in a hurry. They are really cool about processing the check during the meal so we don't have to wait for it until we are finished. Clean, friendly, lots of parking, fast, friendly, good stuff!
1 ||| 'Where you don't peso much\" is the self-professed theme on the logo, but it couldn't be further from the truth.  Burritos and entrees are $5-9 and this is a casual, pretty much fast food place.  side of nachos?  extra side taco?  you're easily pushing $12-15.\n\nEvery burrito I've tried, whether bean and cheese or breafkast burrito, is always somehow dry as a bone.  Tortillas are dry and have a cotton like dry chewy texture.\n\nTalk radio and/or music is always in Spanish and quite loud.  This is good for drowning out the loud baby crying three tables over, but it can get annoying after awhile (especially when it is Spanish talk radio).  \n\nTables were dirty.  They charge you for soft drink refills.  They hoard the napkins behind the counter.  There's limited seating during prime dining hours.
3 ||| We stopped by after a movie matinee. The atmosphere is nice and the food is good, the service is just ok. It look several minutes to be greeted after we sat at the bar. We ordered the tuscan beans with crostini and the calamari.  Both were good. I don't know if the wine pour was a usual for them, but it was generous. It's a nice spot to hang out and for light fare.
3 ||| There is nothing fancy about this place at all, but it is perfect if you want to get a great burger...$2.00 on Tuesdays and all summer long...great wings $5.00 for a dozen any time....Cold cheap beer $5.00 for a pitcher, also any time, all coupled with good, friendly service. They also get the NFL Sunday Ticket and MLB Extra Innings package so you can check out your favorite out of market teams. If you want good food/beer at decent prices give the Dirty Drummer a shot.
0 ||| Accidentally left $750 Ipad in cart, called store over 2 days to see if it was turned in & told no. Left my # every time. Filed police report, asked manager to review surveillance but he refused (I knew exact location & time - no brainer case). \n\nWent in following day to 'kindly request' their help...discovered employees had my Ipad stashed in a drawer the entire time. A Good Samartian turned it right after I left it, 28 hours prior! \n\nStore never called me after 28 hours of agonizing, changing passwords, wasted police & my time. Gave no explanation, perhaps someone there planned to take it(?). God Bless the person who turned this in. Good Karma 3-fold to you!
3 ||| I love this place I have been getting my hair it here for 5 years now and never once has Randy (with the facial hair) given me a bad haircut. Today I went in and the other Randy (clean shaven younger man) did not speak to me once after I told him what I wanted he didn't listen to what I ask and rushed through the whole haircut. I'm very disappointed because the other barbers at this place are very good. So I recommend you go to Randy with the facial hair (I don't want to put his last name on here).
4 ||| Love the orange chicken. The same guy I always behind the counter with a smile on his face. I love we can go here and get the same great service and delicious food every time.
4 ||| The German Sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in Phoenix.  Our family has been enjoying their homemade ham, lyoner, bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years.  Their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh.  Walking through the door will immediately transport you to Europe!  Don't miss this Valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days!
1 ||| Absolutely no customer service on the floor. The salon people will help out if you are way in back by their items. Makeup people will grunt out help if they are questioned. There are nice amount of products there but looking for something specified for just your needs is hard to find because there is no customer service available.
2 ||| Restaurant/bar that used to be a church.  Mmm... sacrilicious.\n\nmiss l's review is right on - beer is pretty tasty, the spinach/cheese artichoke dip is great, i don't think i had anything else to eat.... i'm sure locals come here somewhat regularly but def. the kind of novelty place you're sure to find visitors esp. on weekends.  like me.
0 ||| Do NOT stay here.  I was here for two nights and was robbed. Even though it was just food and drinks that were taken, I can't believe that I was there less than 24 hours and someone came into my room and took stuff out of the frig.  Ridiculous.  I was very angry.  And their towels are like sandpaper.  I literally had to pat myself dry.  I am NEVER staying here again.
1 ||| I did not stay here but went to visit out of town friends who stayed here.  The hotel was definitely not designed for anyone with any type of mobility issue - steps everywhere!  Steps to get ice.  Steps to get to the pool area.  Steps to get to the lobby.  Can you find a way around some of these steps?  Sure - if you don't mind going into the parking lot and circling around the building while cars drive past you.  The rooms seem nice but there is no way on earth I will EVER stay here.  This hotel doesn't seem to have any concern for the disabled whatsoever.
4 ||| We are definitely fans of this place!  The veggie burger and wine burger are excellent. Loved the atmosphere. Very unpretentious as another reviewer posted.
1 ||| Oregano's, you are vile, and I am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you. Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen. Bland, boring, and dehydrating. No thanks.
0 ||| Your service sucks. Even by vietnamese standards. Your host is absent minded. I had to remind me him 3 times about my party and he STILL did not write my name on the list. THEN he seated parties that came after my party. Not just a few, A BUNCH. You suck pho long. Your service blows.  You need a new host, or a better one or at least train them to not ignore your customera.  I am generally very lienient on servce at PHO joints because you get what you pay for but you service was sensationally abysmal. \n\nNot to mention, your Pho is subpar, and the spring rolls are itty bitty.  ugh. never again.
2 ||| Server was not efficient and didn't seem to have a clue. \n\nI ordered a Milk Stout that was on the board and she brought me something I wasn't expecting.  She didn't know they had anything else but I sent it back after telling her about the one that's being promoted.\nNo glass was brought with the beer but I wasn't too concerned with that.\nWe had a salad before our meal and then husband ordered spaghetti with meatballs, a calzone (?) for my son and pizza for me.\nShe passed by the table and dropped of condiments -ketchup and mustard.  WHY?\n\nMultiple tvs surrounding the dining area.\nI don't recall any volume...\nI don't think of this place as a sports bar but with what I saw playing on tv I think it probably falls into that category.\n\nMy pizza was primarily crust with sauce and a bit of cheese.  \nI had maybe 6 pieces of pepperoni, total, and this was the Classic \n(Loads of pepperoni, mushrooms, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and Mozzarella).\n\nThe food is okay, but there are so many other places to go in the Valley for food that's \"okay\".  I would rather hit the Olive Garden or one of the many neighborhood Italian restaurants where the food it better than just okay.
4 ||| I am new to the area and needed a fill SOOOO bad.  Trying to figure out who was good and who was bad, was a bit overwhelming...  I turned to Yelp for Help!  This place had all \"5 Stars\", for their reviews.  Albeit, some of them were very old reviews, so I was a little nervious. \nI called for an appointment and was able to get in the next day.  The place is Very Clean, Friendly, has Reasonable Prices and their clients have been regulars for YEARS. Which says A LOT.\nI could not be happier!  My nails look and feel great. I have found my new Nail Salon in Paradise!  I will be going back for a pedicure soon.
3 ||| Good ice cream place with a hypster coffee shop vibe.  Take it out or sit in.  Smooth, creamy texture,  clean non-overpowering flavor.
3 ||| Went here twice in one day.  Not because it is awesome food, but because it is open 24hrs and was accessible.  The Pho is great.  But my favorite is the beef cube.  The biggest disappointment this time was the chicken fried rice.  There was hardly any chicken and very bland.  Not sure if it was because it was 2:30am and they ran out or not.  But other than that, a good place to get your late night fix.
4 ||| This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.
4 ||| They must have made some changes from the comments below because I really have had an excellent experience going to this Prestige Cleaner location. Staff is super friendly and dry cleaning is always done on time. I'd highly recommend this location.
0 ||| Came here for pizza and wings last night and the quality was WAY off. :(  \n\nThe pizza wasn't nearly as cheesy as normal and all the cheese wasn't even 100% melted, the crust seemed different that usual too.  Less doughy and fluffy and chewy and more like a thin, flavorless, store bought, pre formed crust.  (And I'm sorry, but if you run a special for a $6 12\" pepperoni pizza and the customer asks for just cheese, why not drop the price a tiny smidge, considering that you aren't having to provide any pepperoni on their pizza?  Almost $23 for a small pizza, two dozen wings and one large Pepsi is kinda high.)\n\nThe wings also weren't up to par this visit.  They were badly overcooked, so much so that the drumsticks had all pulled away from the bone and shriveled into little balls of overcooked cooked chicken at the end of the drumstick.  (I can't think of any other way to describe it...)  I like my wings well cooked (like chicken jerky) but last night's wings were just ridiculously overcooked.  They were also woefully skimpy on the sauce, and too boot the butter that makes up the base for my beloved Long Wong's mild wing sauce was kinda off too.  It tasted a tad rancid.  Not enough to make me not eat the wings, but still I could tell it wasn't very fresh like it normally tastes.  It made me pretty sad.\n\nAdding to all that the damn Pepsi wasn't as rich and syrupy and delicious as normal.  This time I could CLEARLY taste the carbonated liquid underneath the Pepsi syrup, and the carbonation was the dominant flavor.  They obviously changed the ratio at the fountain drink dispenser.  (WTF??)\n\nOverall this visit was extremely disappointing.  EXTREMELY.  I am a huge Long Wong's fan, and I live right down the street so I tend to come here a lot, but after last night's visit I am not sure when or if I'll be back...\n\nLong Wong's Management, heed my words.  If a die-hard regular like me is contemplating finding another wing place, you need to take a good, hard look at what you've changed and CHANGE IT BACK.  Whatever penny pinching you did with the pizzas was NO BUENO.  Also, the stinginess on the wing sauce and the Pepsi mixture was not a good move either.  Those were THE things that we loved about your restaurant, and would come and brave the less-than-sparkling-clean conditions at your establishment to enjoy.  If you kill the food quality by skimping on cheese, using some crappy pizza crust, being stingy with wing sauce (ON WINGS!  The VERY THING you are known for!!  DO NOT TAMPER WITH A FAN FAVORITE!) and the syrup mixture on the fountain dispenser then there is almost no way I am braving that frenetic, overcluttered, hot ass mess of dining room restaurant to come back.  Normally I can ignore all that junk on the walls while I savor the delicious food, but now that the food isn't distracting me, I can hardly ignore the random junk dangling from the walls and ceiling.\n\nI am willing to bet you that others will agree here.  You may have saved a little on the ingredients that you just cheaped out on, but it'll cost you a ton in lost repeat business over time.  Penny wise, pound foolish.  Please change it back!
0 ||| Ok I feel obligated to write this so other patients DO NOT COME TO THE ER HERE and drive alittle further for better care. I felt like I wasted my time coming here this hospitali so into getting people in and out they dont really take care of the issue. WhenIgot here I was seen by the physician pretty quick she ordered tests to be done and I let here know I maybe pregnant but a less than 10 days but they still decided not to take a blood test and me being in the healthcare industry I know a urine test wouldnt show anything yet so that was the first red flag\nWhat if they would of given me something that isnt safe for pregnancy?? Obvious they dont care. And that will be the only and one time I saw the doctor in the entire stay. They move me to a shared space with reclining chairs and the person next to me got moved and the nurse that was moved her was the one taking care of my room or space whatever you call it(g502) and she did not even clean the chair before the next person showed up! What happen to UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS to protect people from getting diseases theyre not suppose to get???Im pretty sure they didnt clean mines before I sat there which makes me feel disgusted.Ok I sat there for 1 hr I called for a tylenol because my pain was killing me and 1/2 hr later my nurse came to take my vitals and she tried to discharge at the same give me my test results I told her her I asked for a tylenol earlier and my pain has worsen and I asked for a script for tylenol and she got mad(her name is Rosy G) she told me in a very rude way \"well then I have to do all this over again\" (my discharge paper) and she asked me why didnt I ask for this earlier I told her she never came and seen me. I HAD TO ASK A DIFFERENT NURSE FOR TYLENOL THAT I NEVER GOT AND YOU WERE STANDING THERE RIGHT BEHIND HER YOU COULD OF CAME AND SEE WHAT I NEEDED. Anyways continuing on she came back and give me the discharge paper and kicked me out know I was still in pain and since I never got the tylenol I had to sit outside for 45mins in horrible pain waiting for my ride. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SYSTEM IN THIS ER IS MESSED UP AND ITS TRUE THEY JUST WANT TO GET YOU IN N OUT NOT TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. SANITATION SAVES LIVES AND HERE IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT THEY WILL
0 ||| My wife and I had a very unpleasant, extremely stressful stay at this hotel. Our problem was not with the staff or the accommodations but with the General Manager \"GM\", Adam. We were given a 2 month extended stay rate because I am a patient at the Mayo clinic and am undergoing cancer treatment. \n\nDo to circumstances beyond our control with miscommunications between the front desk clerk, the American Cancer Society , and Adam we got mixed up in a mirage of absolute unnecessary stress. \n\n\nMy wife reported this to higher management and after completing the survey they send online we received a generic apology from Adam, apologizing in behalf of all the staff. Nothing in behalf of his bizarre, inappropriate behavior.\n\nIt is a very sad day when one finds themselves in a new city, without extended family, direly sick and treated like this. It was nothing less than cruel. We both tried talking to him and making whatever amends humanly possible that could be made to appease him. I was in no shape to have to move hotels but he too stated he was \"Done\". Not to professional in any setting. All we heard from other staff also was he was \"Done\". While my wife tried to appease him by making amends he told her the apology she gave was \"not sincere\".\n\nInstead his words were to go back to the \"sister hotel\" or he would call the police. She had walked next door to the Hampton Inn to speak to him because he would not come over and talk to us in person.  Like I said, no experience at all to handle a stressful situation than to threaten with the police and he apparently was afraid of a disabled woman who has had 4 back surgeries and a cancer patient.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic has been made aware of this situation and I sincerely hope no other patients coming in from out of town or state for that matter have to go through this.
0 ||| About a month ago I had Checker replace the sand in my sand filter.  Immediately when he turned on the pump there were bubbles coming out of the return.  I said \"why are there bubbles coming out of the return.  I've never had bubbles coming out of the return?\"  Mike just basically blew me off.   Bled it to get the air out and still have bubbles.  Had their tech guy out and he was just plain rude.  I told him to humor me and check the O ring on the filter lid because I never had bubbles coming of the return and the only thing that has changed is they changed the sand.  The guy didn't want to do it and didn't do it and preceded to tell me how he gets paid.  Bottom line, he just wouldn't get paid enough to check the O ring and heaven forbid he had to replace it.  I've never dealt with a company that won't do something you have asked.
0 ||| Do your research before you allow the owner to rip you off. Items going for $20 on discogs.com will cost you over $100 at Wax Trax. He warns you that he is expensive when you walk in, which is nice, but his mark-up is insulting. Don't get taken advantage of and save your money.
2 ||| Its alright.
1 ||| If you don't know about Perkins, give it a google.  This is a franchise chain type thing.  Really a slightly nicer version of Denny's, with all that entails (paying at the register.  The pie counter.  The mega menu with lots of inserts and featured specials.  Menu pictures that look delicious and nothing like what you actually get served).  And I know your ass has been to Denny's, so I'm not saying anything else.  \n\nMy dining companion (hey sexy) and I eat here every now and then.  I want someone to explain something to me.  Ready?  Here it goes:  WHO ARE ALL THE DAMN PEOPLE EATING AT PERKINS AT 11pm on WEEKDAY?  Where do you all come from?   I mean, you're not high school kids, or college kids.  You're real people, lots of husbands and wives.  What kind of fucking jobs do you do?  Is that your day off?  \n\nPlease, I thought dinner time in the midwest was 6pm sharp.  Who are you fucking people?
0 ||| We just had the worst dining experience since we have moved here at this place. \n\nWe had been regularly eating here about once a week, and even recommended it to some friends, however since we first starting frequenting this location, the service and quality of food has been sliding downhill over time. \n\nTonight was the final straw so to speak, we will not return. After having to wait a ridiculous amount of the time while the manager got our table ready (It was not crowded at all, and he could be seen back in the kitchen doing things.) \n\nAfter a ten minute delay, we were finally seated, and we waited, and after about five more minutes we were about to get up and leave when the manager came over to take our drink order. About 7-10 minutes later a waitress finally came to the table, to verify our drink and appetizer order (why?) so we had to wait another couple minutes for our drinks (water.) \n\nWhen the appetizer finally came, my salad and my fiance's clam chowder were on the tray, at which point the waitress asked if we wanted the two items with our appetizer. We said yes, because why would we want to wait when they have already been thawed, and the waitress had already brought them. \n\nIt was another 10-15 minute wait till out entrees arrived, and mine was not what I ordered. I asked the waitress and she said \"Yes that is what you ordered\" then backtracked and said she would check with the kitchen. \n\nApparently the manager said it was okay to prepare me the proper order, but I was not notified. So after sitting and waiting another ten or fifteen minutes the waitress came by and asked if I had been told that they were preparing the correct dish. I said no, and she said it would be out soon. The Manager never came by our table, for I think he did not want to hear the complaints since it was obvious we were not happy, especially after all the wait time. Finally about 5 minutes after the waitress informed me that I would get the proper meal, it came out, and was obviously \"hurried.\" \n\nWe asked for the check, and received yet another ten minute wait, and when we looked at it, I was appalled that we were given no discount whatsoever for the issues. The Manager still never came by our table, and would not even look in our direction. \n\nThis place is such a disappointment, when we started eating there it was great, well priced, good service, good quality. The last 4-5 times we have been there it has been horrible, and tonight was the worst. I really do hope that the Owner/Managers see my review, for they have lost our business, and we ate there frequently, and we will not continue to tell people to try it.
0 ||| It's Filiberto's. They are all similar, but differ considerably in food quality and service.\n\nThis one is the worst Filiberto's I've been to. Dirty, poor quality, and staff we encountered were argumentative and rude. I think my wife and I got sick from the food at this one.\n\nLike any Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless!
2 ||| After two long days of business we decided to eat near our hotel and this was the only option. It is a bar and bar food. At first we sat at the bar since there was a private party on the patio but asked the hostess to let us know when we could move outside since she said it was wrapping up. The tables at the bar are sticky! The server said, yeah they are just like that. Gross! Thankfully a minute later we were able to move to the patio. Actually really nice out there. Our server was very sweet too. Actually everyone was very friendly there a big plus! Some good beers on draft and my boss got a lemon drop martini she really enjoyed. We started with the spinach dip. This was weirdly very watery. Not sure why...tasted meh...my boss ordered the steak salad and I got the club sandwich. The food was average which is actually fine by me at a bar. As long as it is decent that is what is to be expected. The dip was a little off but meals not bad.
0 ||| We went to Macaroni Grill a couple weeks ago and were extremely disappointed with pretty much everything about the experience. The service was slow at best on a not very busy night. The food did not taste fresh at all, in fact tasted as if it had been cooked two days prior and just nuked in the microwave. My wife ordered what our waitress said was the \"best item on the menu\" and it was quite tasteless. I had the Italian trio sampler which was bland. We will undoubtedly never go there again.
4 ||| In Vegas, this is \"as good as it gets\" if you are craving some Asian food late at night after the clubs. \n\nOpen super late. Warm soup really hits the spot at 4am in Vegas. You can't find anything this authentic on the strip at 4am. On a recent Vegas trip, I went with 4 other Vietnamese girls and they took me here two nights in a row. The first night I tried the pho and the second night I tried the banh canh cua (large noodles in soup with crabmeat and fish cake). \n\nThey have a wide selection and everything is reasonably priced. Yuuumy!
3 ||| Went here for Breakfast with my Grand daughter. She loved  the play place. I ordered  the bacon egg biscuit, hash browns and iced coffee for me and since they do not have happy meals at breakfast time( they really need to come up with a happy meal breakfast!) we ordered scrambled eggs and bacon for her. My biscuit was very dry and the hash browns were cold in the middle. Scrambled eggs were not fully cooked but bacon was nice and crispy.
3 ||| Went there NYE for dinner and had a great experience. Waitress was funny and had a great knowledge of everything on the menu. The only thing I found wrong with this place is that it is a little too small for the amount of tables in it.
3 ||| A little overpriced but the bagels are always good and fresh. The cinnamon French toast (made from their cinnamon log bread) is also very good!
2 ||| I will start to say... The owner is not so much of a nice guy, the establishment could use some updating, the bathroom is Disgusting(!), Garfield is not an uplifting environment (women, do NOT walk alone here at night) those are the negatives offhand.  The good is that some obscure independent bands play here for a relatively inexpensive price, the sound is adequate the \"artwork\" SUCKS! go see a show here & just be overwhelmingly WOWed!
0 ||| I've been here and had great service. But honestly , we're still in a bad economy.  The service was bad. They have these tokens by the door and I saw the guy behind the counter give it to someone. So I asked , \"what's that for?\". He ignored me. I asked again clearly and a bit louder , ignored me again. There are a lot of people who need jobs right now and the people getting hired are rude. I tweeted them that next time I'll just use iTunes. and I will. Your new albums are priced just as much , if not higher , than what I'd be paying for a download on iTunes ,  amazon mp3 , or other big brand stores. And yes this is a real review. I was there today , a beatles poster and a copy of a 3d only version of \"Avatar\" were purchased. A copy of sherlock holmes was purchased , but then exchanged unopened for avatar.
0 ||| The hotel had a nice environment.  Upon arrival, I thought the d\u00e9cor was a bit dated but almost achieved a timeless elegance.  The staff were also extremely helpful, and during my stay I appreciated the comfort of the bed as well as the breakfast in the morning.  I think their parking was also above par.\nHowever, the hotel fell short in a couple of ways, two of them very big ways.  The biggest was noise.  I could hear EVERYTHING!  I stayed in 301, which is right across from the elevator and the banging of that elevator woke me up at least 10 times each night (I stayed for three nights so by the third night I was so tired I could hardly function).  A man had a phone call in the room next to me and I could clearly hear him talking.  \"Hello, I am in Madison right now... Yes, I will be leaving tomorrow.. If you could actually go ahead and email me the form I can fill it out...\" and so on.  Not even muffled.  I do not believe this to be a result of him speaking loudly because, as I said, no distortion of the voice, and after he checked out, I could hear the radio in that room - they leave the radio on classical music for you so when you arrive its all serene.  Little do you know that light music is being heard next door!  So, walls made of paper.  And, back to the elevator, I usually take stairs but when I took the elevator on the first floor, the door just opened and slammed shut repeatedly so that I eventually gave up and took the stairs anyways.  So, I believe this extremely loud elevator was just slamming open and shut open and shut all night across from my room.  It was terrible.  I have slept better in $50/night rooms!\nThe other, slightly less obnoxious issue, was that it was COLD!  I was freezing - had to take a few showers just to warm up - and they did not have heating available because it was June.  Yes, it was June... it was also 40 degrees outside...\nLast, small items, table leg was broken and no microwave or fridge.  For $160 a night I think these should be addressed.  Oh and room was laid out strange... only mirror was between bed and wall so you couldn't really stand in front of it.  Small matters compared with the inability to sleep due to the racket.\nStayed in 301.  Avoid!!!
1 ||| I can't really rate this place more than 2 stars, for one thing is that it's a fast food joint, and if you read my reviews then you should know that I rarely rate anything above 2 stars if it's a fast food place. This place has low and I mean very low quality of food, but because it is cheap, fast and open late, it will get my money. I really don't enjoy eating at this place, but it's really hard to resist 2 tacos for 99 cents after a great night of booze overdose. When the day is over, I usually find myself at this place after hours. I guess you can say that as long as they got cheap food open late, I'll continue to come here.
3 ||| I came here around 9:30 pm on a Friday and had a reservation even though there appeared to be some open tables. The drinks are worth it, especially the offer you can't refuse drink-I had two. The food is alright. I had the pork and shrimp fried rice. I've definitely had better thai food in other restaurants at a much lower price..but come for the atmosphere, I suppose.
0 ||| Normally, I would give Southwest a five. I have flown on every major airline and several not so major ones and Southwest always comes through. The flight attendants are friendly and creative. The seats are usually comfortable and have plenty of leg room. Waiting in line is never an issue and the boarding process is quick and efficient. But the last flight I had was atrocious and it was all because of the service. \n\n12/26/2011: Flight 944 from Austin, Texas to Phoenix, Arizona. The attendant who was covering the middle of the plain was not having a good day and she decided to take it out on the passengers. She completely skipped over my row which perhaps might have been because everyone else was already fast asleep, but I had been patiently waiting to order a drink. She looked me directly in the eye and kept walking. I thought perhaps her machine wasn't working properly and that she would be back to take my order but she never returned. \n\nNext, the handing out of roasted peanuts and crackers, which are not always the most delicious of treats but I had been trying to save money and not eat at the airport and was looking forward to a snack. Once again, the attendant skipped over my row. I waved my hand this time to get her attention but she never looked up from the basket of peanuts. \n\nFinally, the drinks were delivered and when she came to my row, I asked her nicely if I could order a drink and have a bag of peanuts. She glared at me and asked what I wanted in an impatient tone. I ordered ginger ale and she brought it a few minutes later. She didn't bring the peanuts and she didn't look at me or acknowledge the fact that I thanked her for her trouble. I thought maybe she couldn't handle a tray of drinks and peanuts at the same time so I waited to see if she would bring them separately. I waited a half hour. Looking around, everyone had gotten their drinks. \n\nFor the first time ever, I pressed the flight attendant button. A few minutes later, she came over. I asked if I could have a snack and that my row had been skipped earlier. She huffed and told me that I would get my snack in a condescending tone that made me feel like I was being impatient. \n\nI learned from their announcements that all the attendants were from Dallas. The flight I was on had come from Dallas which meant that my unfriendly stewardess had barely started her shift. I tried to think why she might be in a such a bad mood, either from having to work the day after Christmas or perhaps she got into a fight before she left or maybe it was because she got stuck with a night shift and the lines on her face suggested she may be getting too old for night shifts. \n\nAt the end of the flight, as I disembarked, I nodded at her to see what kind of reaction I got. She squinted at me and said \"bye\" in a short and abrupt way. I couldn't help but notice that her tone of voice had been much softer toward the other guests and she had said things like \"come and see us again,\" or \"thank you, have a nice evening.\" I'm not sure why she had beef with me but I have never had such horrible service.
0 ||| From the outside this place looks decent, and something about the 9 neon signs covering the windows that draws you to this location. \n\nUpon entering, this place the first thing you notice is how terrible the inside looks. The tile flooring resembles the bathrooms that you might be encounter in tijuana or rocky point bar. \n\nOrdering can be interesting, and due to a lack of a menu, and but they have handy pamphlets. The wife and I both ordered a Carnitas burrito And tacos. \n\nThe food was edible, and bland, and flavorless. The Carnitas were cut into cubes, and it had quite a large amount of fat, and a ton of onions. The carne asada tacos were full of onions too. The food was flavorless and generic. \n\nI will never come here again.
0 ||| Just ate there less than an hour ago.. our waitress was so sweet and nice and was very attentive to our needs.. but the food was horrible.. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the black and Bleu burger and we ordered an order of corn bread muffins.. first of all the corn bread muffins were dry and too well done.. second my sandwich was just dry chicken with a glob of bbq sauce on it and the magic dust.. my husband's burger was supposed to be medium rare and came out well done.. the macaroni and cheese must have been like a stouffers  mac and cheese.. I was really disappointed cause I thought this place was supposed to be a championship bbq place..
1 ||| I was greeted warmly. The menu items were explained well and I was even offered a sample when I couldn't decide what salad dressing to get.  The salads that were being prepared looked pretty delicious! Time to pay...\n\nBefore ringing me up, I informed the cashier that I had a Groupon to use. She said I had to have a voucher printed out. Then, she showed me a handwritten post it next to the employee phone that stated coupons must be originals, not from an email or phone. She told me it must say that on my Groupon... So I showed her. She said to me, \"See! You need to follow the directions and it says 1. Print Groupon.\" I kindly showed her the following statement which says, \"(or pull it up with our mobile app).\"  She said, \"I don't know how to do that. It probably is for a Phoenix location. THIS is not Phoenix.\" Duh, I knew where I was... exactly where the Groupon directions led me! LOL. \n\nAnyhow, we went back and forth for a bit and she rang me up. I told her I wasn't going to get anything and she was livid... She called me rude for ordering and walking away. That's not exactly how I see it happening. She told me that she has never heard of a company giving a discount without proof of a voucher, that it would be like giving something away. Huh... sigh. \n\nSo basically my review is about customer service and not the food as I didn't get a chance to try it. Generally, Quiznos is pretty tasty too. :-(
2 ||| I went to Park House after much internal deliberation. And after reading all the high reviews from fellow yelpers. \n\n  This bar is less than 5 minutes from where I live.  I stopped in on a Saturday night and was pleased with the music that was playing and also the fact that the bar was not overcrowded. The bar tender barely acknowledged me the whole night.  \n\nThere wasn't any free peanuts or popcorn when I visited. Nor did they have the beer that I like on tap.  I did get a very tasty double chocolate stout, which I found to be delicious in every way.  The owner of the place even gave me an annoyed look.\n\nSaturday night is usually a crappy night to try out any new place.  The service was slow but I got the feeling that the bartender couldn't be bothered to wait on me.  \n\nI haven't completely written this place off.  I'll just try again during the week.
0 ||| After my party arrived, we were told that bread was in the oven, and it should be out shortly.  Thirty minutes later, another couple walked in, was seated, and they were eating bread while our table was still bare.  Very disappointing service.\n\nOur waitress was absent-minded, and absent in general.  We had to ask the manager a few times to bring her over to take our order or bring us a drink we had ordered ten minutes prior.  The place was nearly empty when we arrived.\n\nOur appetizer order was put in after sitting for 20 minutes.  We waited probably another 15 minutes waiting to make a pizza order.  We had two small children with us, so we really didn't want to sit and wait for hours and hours.  We still wanted to order a pizza, and our waitress is nowhere to be found.  People are coming in, making to-go orders, getting them and leaving.  The manager walked by, and we asked if he could get our waitress since we were ready to order.  Finally, about 5-10 minutes later, she arrives and take the pizza order.  We wait 10 more minutes for any food to arrive.  By this time, we had been there 40 minutes with no bread or appetizers. Finally, a batch of cold garlic bread sticks arrived with steaming marinara.  It seems that the kitchen DID make the bread as our waitress promised so long ago, but the order sat out for quite awhile before it made it to us.\n\nA few moments later, the appetizers arrived.  Then the pizza came, but we still hadn't received dinner plates.\n\nI'm giving 5 stars for the food.  The pizza, wings, and spinach artichoke dip were excellent.  I'm giving negative 3 stars for the service.  Absolutely terrible experience.  When we left the restaurant was empty.  Several other tables came and went while we dined.  Feeling ignored doesn't sit well.\n\nWe will not return to Streets of New York on 90th & Shea.
3 ||| I am in love with Bikram yoga now.  I'm not much of a routine person or exerciser but i can work with this.\n\nBefore you go, HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE! When I didn't, I definitely felt it and not only almost fainted in class several times but had a nasty headache following the class all day!!!!\n\nBikram is a series of 26 asanas (postures) in a 104 degree room. Some days feel a little warmer than others. Not sure if that's me or the room temps.\n\nI suggest reading Bikram Chouhoury's book (got it from the phx library) to study the postures and get great tips if you're concerned about whether you're doing them right as its not common to receive personal corrections during class.\n\nI love that they have early morning hours. The 6 am class is a goddess-send when I have to work 10 hour shifts. \n\nThere is a script Bikram has his instructors say for the most part. That kind of gets monotonous but some change it up and keep it funny and interesting.\n\nBathrooms, shower and dressing room are clean.\n\nIf you forget your water or dont have a mat, you can rent/buy here but don't forget to bring a long towel to lie over your mat and a hand towel to dab all that sweat your gonna be drippin'.\n\nA.M. Instructors are friendly and cool, especially Sabre. Love her! (can't speak for the others because I only go in the mornings)\n\nIf you commit for a year with autopay, you get an awesome unadvertised price of $100/month unlimited. Totally worth every penny and then some. \n\nDownsides at this studio:\n\n* Not sure the carpet is cleaned often enough. The smell of feet and mold can be distracting and a turn off during practice. (UPDATE: May 2011 - Carpet is no longer stinky so they must have increased the cleanings. Thank you. Makes all the difference, guys)\n\n* One shower stall for how many girls?\n\n*Website is unimpressive and could use revamping to reflect all of the instructors bios and specials offered.  \n\n*There is no option to pay online. To auto pay monthly, one of the instructors inputs my card info manually each time. I trust him, but its just not secure enough for my tastes.\n\n* No store in studio to purchase special hot yoga clothing and accessories.\n\n*What, no Twitter or FB page?\n\n* People who do not use deodorant and other personal body odors. YUCK!\n\nThat may look like a lot of downsides but I Love this place and the new friends I have met and have committed to an annual practice. \n\nDo this yoga and grow into the poses at your own pace, pushing yourself to your own personal limits and you will be rewarded greatly for your resolve!
4 ||| One of the best dinning experiences of my life.  My wife and I recently went to celebrate of 4th wedding anniversary.  We were greeted so warmly when we checked in with the hostess and it seemed every one on the staff was aware of our special day.  Our waiter was very attentive, but never interrupted our conversation.  Needless to say, the views are spectacular and the food was amazing.  There brought us so many different breads and unique dips and sauces to try almost as soon as we were seated.  My dinner had a half dozen different combinations of flavors, different meats and sauces.  The deserts were delicious and it even had a customized \"Happy Anniversary\" chocolate integrated into the design.  It was just an amazing experience and I know we'll be going back.
3 ||| I haven't been to PVL in over a decade and I've never been here sober.  Place hasn't changed much but I think It might be a tad cleaner. Bathroom wasn't repulsive. \n\nThe live music was great although the sound in that place blows. Will definitely return to see some great local bands. \n\n\nPalo Verde Lounge is a  Tempe institution. Great local metal and thrash scene. \nDon't be scared it's not that bad.
1 ||| Recently, when we've shopped at JSM, we've had the unfortunate experience of returning home, excited to use/or are in the midst of using a product, whereupon we notice one of the following: 1. Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \n\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \n\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \n\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \n\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \"clean\" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \n\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \n\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \"freegan\" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \"mom & pop\" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both. It's unfortunate since we like the place, or rather, we want to like it, but there are just too many problems.
0 ||| This has gone from being the best Starbucks in Las Vegas to one of the worst. \n\nThe service tends to be on the rude side these days. \n\nThey close extremely early. While most Starbucks close at 10, this place closes like at 7 or 8. \n\nThere is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi. The same people loiter here all day long, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \n\nMy last drink here tasted like some guy  grabbed a stale cookie, crushed it in the palm of his hand, and dropped it into water mixed with chocolate syrup. It didn't even taste like coffee. \n\nThere is no such thing as half n half here. \n\nIt's so loud in here that you have to scream in order for the barista to hear you. \n\nIt's so loud in here that you won't hear the barista scream your name when your drink is ready. \n\nThere is a group  of middle-age men who sit outside with their puppies in order to get the attention of cutie-pie teenage girls. These guys have been doing this for so long that the puppies are now full grown dogs. \n\nAlso remember how this is Summerlin so everyone acts like they are 11 years old. They will complain about every little thing. If you are standing in line, the guys behind you will constantly keep bitching about how they hate waiting in line. This happens at every Summerlin business I go to. Why are Summerlin folks so impatient? \n\nThe parking lot in this particular area of the shopping center is very cramped. Either these people drive really bad or they are confused and think that this Starbucks has a drive-thru. I don't know how many times I narrowly avoided death in this parking lot.  \n\nThese days I go to the Starbucks in Centennial near Floyd Lamb Park. The internet is much quicker, and they close at 10.
4 ||| I'll say I'm a fan even though I can agree with the other reviewer that customer service here might be an issue.  You really have to get past that though.  The gentlemen that runs this place is strictly business and it's a business he's good at.\n\nI can't speak to the dry cleaning side, all I know is that if you need clothes tailored or altered, this is your guy.  I had lost some serious inches and he made my old stuff fit like new.  Totally worth it.
2 ||| Ramen DX was salty; skewers were ok but nothing blew me away. We ordered grilled whole squid which was totally forgotten so we ended up canceling it...
1 ||| Just picked up a 7\" pepperoni pizza after seeing Nello's on Check Please Arizona on PBS.  The gentleman behind the counter at Nello's opened the VERY small box to reveal a VERY small pizza.  I said nothing about the size since it is a 7\" pizza and it was just for me since I was trying it out for the family.  As I stared at it, he said:  the pepperoni is under the cheese.  He read my mind,  \"Where the heck was the pepperoni?\"  As I ate the first slice it took quite a bit to find a VERY, VERY thin slice of pepperoni.  Not happy.  The second slice had a thin slice of pepperoni that was visible and which I could taste.  Had a good taste but not enough to be called  a pepperoni pizza.  I paid $7.38 for this tiny pizza with virtually no pepperoni and frankly I am embarrassed at myself for being misled by a TV program and for paying such a premium price for a morsel of pizza.  \n The next time that I buy a pizza with pepperoni, I will check to make sure it has enough pepperoni to be called a pepperoni pizza. I don't want to have to hire a search party to find the pepperoni in my next pizza.
4 ||| Great service from Ahmod at the counter it's really nice to find great customer service this day and age. Nice job cobblestone team! Especially Ahmod!
3 ||| It might look a little cheesy from the street, but this place easily entertains a 2 y.o. for hours, which rates hugely in my book.\nIt's good to take a couple of bucks so they can ride the train and the carousel, but if you don't have it, there are still TWO excellent playgrounds, one with misters, the other with an old West theme and a roof they can climb up to.\nThere is a wall of windows with  toy trains running inside, bunny rabbits and ground squirrels in the park, toy trains to play with in the snack bar and lots of grass they can run in. The hot chocolate is excellent!\nDuring the summer it's a ghost town, during the winter it's packed so if you're not a people person you have to go early weekdays, somewhere in between the two is best.\nWatch out for the pebble sidewalk. If they run instead of walk they can end up with a face full of road rash.\nTheir Christmas setup is nice and they sometimes have bands.\nThere was a football player sighting here not long ago (Kurt Warner maybe?) proving everyone has to come here at some point whether you're an auntie or parent.
3 ||| Food is better some days than others, Seems more fresh. My favorite entree is the  Aguachiles, yummy! Prices are pretty much as other Mexican seafood restaurants. But the servers/waitresses should smile more often as they currently walk around looking unhappy! LOL no really, the food is good, service not so much.
2 ||| Considering all the rave reviews I'd heard about Benvenuto's, I was pleased when my ex-boyfriend wanted to take me out to dinner there.  Mmm, Italian, right?\n\nNahhh.  Not so much.  It was like a slightly souped up version of the Olive Garden.  The food wasn't bad, but it was truly unimpressive.  I got something that should've made my head explode with deliciousness (because, honestly, what's not to love about sausages, peppers and pasta with spicy tomato sauce?), but instead I was left feeling quite \"Meh\" about the whole thing.  Plus, the place was noisy and lacked any inkling of ambiance.\n\nIf you want a good Italian chain, go to Biaggi's.  If you want good Italian, PERIOD, go to Lombardino's.
3 ||| Decided to try Sonoma Cellar as I had a $25.00 discount coupon. Over priced for the quality or should i say lack of quality. The sea bass was an excellent size and the taste would have been great except everything we ordered was too salty. This included the lobster tail and all side dishes. Does the chef own a salt mine ? The young lady asked if we had reservation. With the place nearly empty at 6PM on a Saturday who needs reservations ? I asked for a booth but was directed to a table. For $10.00 I'm sure I could have secured the table of my choice. if you are visiting from East No Where, AK . and think Applebees or Outback are great restaurants you'll love this place. My favorite restaurant here in Las Vegas is THE PALM in Caesars Place. You will pay twice as much but the food is 3 times better.
3 ||| 9/26/13 My wife and I had dinner at the Capitol Chophouse.  We enjoyed an appetizer of scallops, shrimps, oysters, and crab legs.  For an entr\u00e9e she had the Black Earth pasture raised lamb and I had the Black Earth grass fed rib-eye.   We also enjoyed a bottle of pinot noir by Archery Summit's Red Hills Estate.  If you want steak or seafood dine at the Chop (end of story).  :-)\n\nThey are part of the downtown Hilton Monona Terrace Hotel and will validate your parking.
1 ||| We have been regular customers here for several years and have always gotten the steampot for 2.  The last time we were here we noticed that the food content had been cut in half...but the price has remained the same.  We won't be coming back.
1 ||| A modern shopping experience (back in the 80s)\n\nI paid a visit to the DeForest Pick n Save earlier today and it was exactly as I remembered it when I lived in DeFo 15 years ago, as in, it hasn't changed one bit.  This is a store that could really use a face lift.  The industrial grade linoleum, the high metal ceilings, the harsh florescent lighting give the place that institutional warehouse vibe that just screams 1980.\n\nIt wasn't a real productive shopping trip. The produce quality was not very good.  The celery looked past its prime (think pale green with browning tips).  The same could be said of the salad greens.  There was little in the way of organic produce, but I did like the country of origin signs on the produce. (The poor quality of the produce surprised me since both Pick n Save and Copps are owned by Roundy's and the produce quality at Copps in generally pretty decent.) \n\nThe selection in the deli counter was limited and the meat department was hit or miss.  (I did find some decent looking beef tenderloin, but they did not carry the Smart Chicken brand that prefer)\n\nThe international food section consisted of a third of a row of taco kits, salsa and soy sauce.  The selection of dry goods followed the theme of limited selection with prices 15% to 25% higher than Woodmans.\n\nI ended up leaving and picking up the items I needed at the local Piggly Wiggly that looked downright palatial in comparison to this Pick n Save.  So much for my trip down (grocery) memory lane...
4 ||| Looking for fast and DELICIOUS mexican food? Go to Roberto's and find happiness. Order the carne asada nachos and find bliss (as well as an extra pound or two). The service was suprisingly good. The cashier was super friendly (unlike some of the other Roberto's I went to). She was also very accomadating to the guests.\n-she replaced someone's ordered happily and even gave them the mistake order. (some places don't even do that!)\n-a few customers didn't know what to get and she helped them out\n\nMan, I wish I got her name down. \n\nThe location is a bit older than the other gazillion roberto's that are around but the bathrooms were clean.\n\nNow that I've mentioned the bathrooms, I can talk about the food...\n\nThe food was delicious. I ordered the carne asada nachos and I truly was about to cry in delight. The last time I got it (at a different location) it was very oily at the bottom. This time, it was not. There was so much meat on there I thought I was going to pop.\n\nDid I mention that it was 24 hours??
4 ||| Do I know the first thing about comic book stores? Absolutely not. But, do I know a well-stocked retail store when I see one? Absolutely. \n\nI walked into All About Books & Comics while on the hunt for a vintage comic book that stood out from the rest. As a girl who played with barbies and my little ponies rather than superman and batman, I didn't know where to even begin, but the yelp reviews promised me a store full of vintage and new comic books and stocked full. Upon walking in, I realized immediately that the store lived up to its yelp expectations. \n\nI consulted the man behind the counter because I didn't even know where to begin. I told him that I was looking for a vintage comic book for under $20 but something that a collector would appreciate. He immediately took out a binder full of a backlog of every single comic book in the store and a history behind each book. I'm talking about a villain's first appearance to the first time a superhero found a new trait. It was like another language to me but I knew this guy knew what he was talking about. Comics like the walls, the shelves, the counters, the cabinets. They are everywhere. If you are a fan of the comics, this could be your kryptonite... to quote an all star super hero of course. \n\nSo after twenty minutes of searching for the perfect comic book, I finally found the one. According to the comic book connoisseur himself, this 1959 spider man comic was the first time Mary Jane appeared on a cover. It's no first edition Batman but for the price, a collector will appreciate it. So, with that I took my brand new (old) comic book and was on my way. \n\nSo all you comic book lovers...I am pretty certain this is the place you want to be to spend the days reading about heroes and villains. They even celebrate happy hour here.
3 ||| Buffalo has a special place in my heart since I used to shop at the 7th street and Glendale location as a kid  (before the Safeway shopping center).  But I was never hard core enough to shop at the Tempe one - that was too punk rock for me.\n\nAnyways, I love stopping in for browsing. I'm one of the people that only wishes they could pull off looks from here.  But that would require some level of creativity and fashion sense.  2 things I have very little of.  But I have managed to find good jeans and sunglasses.\n\nThey really have some funky things, but you should definitely try them on and inspect things with a close eye. Holes and stains abound here - and I can't understand how they make it past the buyers.  They never hardly buy anything I bring in and that is in pristine condition.  Maybe it has more to do with the fact that my wardrobe reflects the deficiencies noted above.  Still - there should be a quality element to the \"buying process\" too.\n\nDefinitely worthy of a frequent stop in - I'm glad I found one in MPLS to browse, it alleviates any home -sickness.
4 ||| Very respectable people.
4 ||| I have yet to have a 5 star experience here to date.  Can't believe this place is rated this highly.  I've been trying to give them a chance to impress me since they first opened their doors but so far it's nothing but very average Mexican food.  Before writing this review I thought I'd visit them one more time since it had been awhile. Maybe somethings changed I thought.  Nope...still extremely average and not worth driving cross town for but if you're in the area and hungry then go for it.  Yesterdays choice was a carnitas burro and a order of super nachos.   My biggest problem with my two choices yesterday and with every visit I've ever made here is there is just not much flavor to the food.  In my opinion you can usually judge a Mexican food place by the salsa that arrives with your chips before you order. If they can't make a good salsa you can pretty much be assured the rest of your experience will match the salsa experience.  That being said this place has the most flavorless salsa I've ever tasted.
3 ||| Amazing food and value - authentic and delicious. Very nice and hard working host - we didn't mind the wait as this lady works  real hard.
3 ||| Haven't been in here since it was remodeled, but I do like the new upgrades.  Service was good, more of an open feel.  The cheese curds were good,  but they weren't as golden brown as I prefer.  They had dollar tacos today which were tasty and a good deal.
2 ||| Really couldn't find anything special about the sandwiches here. Boars Head meat is always good, but I'm not sure if they are actually slicing the meat for each sandwich. Turkey seemed like it was cut another time, wrapped up in some plastic and then unfolded for each person's sandwich. They also doused the entire thing with about a quart of Russian Dressing (#5), put some fancy tomatoes on the sandwich and I requested a change of cheese from baby swiss to Smoked cheddar. You can only get about 8 different cheeses here on your sandwich (the rest you must buy) and they only carry one style of Boars Head turkey. No pepper or pastrami style, nothing but boring old plain turkey. Whoever is raving about the macaroni salad must be a rookie as well. The mac salad lacked any flavor and resembled ones you will find in a supermarket tub. There might be some better sandwich combinations out there on their extremly cluttered back wall (it's actually not cute cause your menu is in 20 places), but with the limited variety of meats, it doesn't mean much. Yeah, it's been there awhile, but so what, McDonald's has been around awhile too.
4 ||| I have to give this place 5 stars!!! I went today to get my oil changed after work around 430.  I had never been to this location and I left happy.  I pulled up and the young guy working was so helpful and kind.  They took my car and were done in 5-10 minutes.  I literally went inside to pay (20 dollars by the way) cheapest oil change I have paid.  I walked inside to the cashier, where there is a kids playground inside(who knew) The two people working were smiling and seemed to be super happy (even if they were working on a Saturday)  The man gave me a receipt and said now that you have this you can come in next time and get a free car wash and also today you get free popcorn.  I laughed and was surprised by the popcorn machine near the entrance (fresh popcorn).  I left after spending twenty bucks with popcorn, a free car wash and an oil change under 10 minutes.  I will be back :)
4 ||| I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.
3 ||| This bar is the divey-est of dive bars, but it's a great bar. The music is decent, the bartenders &amp; owner are really friendly, the drinks are cheap (and strong). Most of the people that go into the bar are regulars, and those that are not, are treated as if they were.\n\nHowever, it's not the most clean place in the hood. That, and the cash only schtic is kind of a pain in the ass if you have no cash &amp; you're going there on a whim (or aren't prepared).\n\nMake sure to make your mark in the bathroom.. bring a sharpie!
4 ||| this hawaiian/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii. I ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good. the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets. deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu. The ALOHA spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas..thanks to RUSSEL.
0 ||| I'm not the type to write Yelp reviews, but my recent experience at Lulu's made me want to do a public service and warn people to not eat here. Lulu's has gone seriously downhill in the last few years. \n\nSome lowlights of our experience:\n\n- Had to ask for napkins twice to no avail. Finally had to get up from the table, walk to the counter, and fetch some myself. Hello, where's my waitress?\n- No cutlery came with our food, so had to ask for some. Chopsticks arrived 5 minutes after noodles did.\n- Beef pho was absolutely inedible - lukewarm, flavorless, disgusting. I had to send it back to the kitchen. If you've ever had real pho, don't get it at Lulu's. Best case scenario you'll be sorely disappointed, more realistic is that you'll want to gag and be sick at the table.\n- \"Pan-fried noodles\" are actually just an uncooked circular ramen brick covered in warm chicken and bok choy. I know Lulu's is catered towards the budget-conscious college crowd, but I could've saved more money and time just by buying a $0.25 packet of Maruchan from CVS and eating it straight from the bag.\n\nThe only tasty thing at Lulu's is the Sriracha sauce.
0 ||| If you want the real thing, take the time to actually drive to Miami/Globe. This place is nothing like the food you get in Miami/Globe and just because they are extended family doesn't mean that you are getting same quality of food. While service was friendly, the food was not worth a first trip. Tostada was soggy and dripped liquid, they charge for chips that come in a bowl no bigger than the salsa bowl, and cleanliness was questionable. I truly do not like to write bad reviews, and generally don't. But there are so many better choices for both quality and value.  If you want Miami/Globe style, then take time to drive there. No extension comes close.
1 ||| I just left this place with my friend, the only pro is that the waiters were super friendly and the service was fast, got our food pretty quick considering it was busy. We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap, my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries, they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy, plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap.
0 ||| I decided to try Dr Abbott out this week.  The front desk was very kind and helpful but the Dr was very rude.  He had multiple snarky comments.  I have a small, part time prescription, that I only wear when I'm driving and getting migrains.  At the end of my appointment he told me, this wasn't much of a prescription, did I just have nothing better to do than to come into his office today?  I can assure you I will not be bothering him with my time or money again.
0 ||| Worst cantonese food I ever ate..literally. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Cantonese food, its my favorite food. I been to soo many Sam Woos back in So. Cal. and it was really decent but after going to this one, I wanted to go back to the buffets in the strip just to get the taste out of my mouth.
0 ||| Terrible service . Love when the bartenders are drinking more than you. Not to mention harass you about playing the machines
3 ||| This was our first time here.  We got in before the rush and were lucky enough to sit under the cover.  The brisket, pulled pork and hot link were incredibly good in addition to the mac n cheese and baked beans!  Great place to try and we will definitely go back as the meat was so tender, juicy and good that we did not need BBQ sauce!  The only down side is when it is super hot out, it would be nice to sit indoors some where and not have to shoo flies.  The service line is slow so plan to be there for a while, but the food is DEFINITELY worth the wait.  HUGE portions and excellent quality! Finally a good BBQ place in Vegas!!  A Must Try!
3 ||| When visiting LV, sometimes you just want some hawaii-style home cooked food.  If you are Hawaiian-Korean and you are looking for some meat jun, banchan, bulgogi, kalbi, kimchee, with some local dishes like loco moco, katsu, spam and eggs, etc. this is the place for you.  This is old style local fusion (not to be confused with Roy's or Sam Choy).  Service is friendly.  It is great for the Hawaii-style food but it is no 5 star.  But I like it recommend it.
3 ||| The lunch special at the Pizzeria Uno is a good deal, so that must be why we keep going back even though we have terrible service time after time. Don't go there if you're looking for a quick lunch. The servers are usually absent-minded and it takes a while for your food to come out. The pizza is all right, but as a Chicagoan, it can't compare to the true deep dish pizza back home. If you go, the flatbread quesadillas are a good dish to try.
3 ||| This bar was a lot of fun! I loved the cheap/reasonably priced drinks, I loved the diverse crowd. I can't speak for the food since I ate elsewhere before the bar but overall atmosphere gets 5 stars. One thing I would like to say, this place needs to check who they allow to play live music in there. The guys who played Saturday 3/1, Kevin Marshall and Scott Sutton, were incredibly racist and made no qualms about it in their songs. I'm a white guy and I was extremely offended by their ignorance. If you read this, Big Al's, don't let these a-holes play in your bar anymore. Also, they were way too loud. Good bar for a night out with friends, just check the schedule for live music and make sure the aforementioned \"musicians\" aren't there.
1 ||| Gonna have to give this one a \"no thanks\" I'm afraid.\n\nWent today at lunch with a couple of co-workers, and the food was totally underwhelming.\n\nNothing \"special\" at all about any of the items.  The guacamole seemed to have some sour cream in it to stretch it - tasted very bland.  Red and green salsa served with run-of-the-mill chips did nothing for us.\n\nMeat in all the dishes was tender but not very flavorful.  Shrimp Diabla sauce was neither hot nor very tasty.\n\nAll in all, a disappointing lunch.  Won't be back, and with all the good options in town for excellent Mexican food, I was sad that we did not find a good new place to frequent.
0 ||| This place is overpriced and all there fish look ill!! Bought a fish and got home and he was dead I called three times they kept hanging up on me after I told them what happened! I went to the store and they were waiting for me at the front of the store and made a big deal about taking the dead fish back! I had it not even 2 hours with me and it died still in bag from there store they finally said ok to replace it with another one. But this place is seriously the worst fish store in town! Do not buy from them there fish all look sick!
4 ||| When in Madison, we knew we had to come to Brats... it was where M's stepmom had her first sip of alcohol ever. She recalled a particular shot and said that she almost spit it out all over the bar. So naturally, we wanted to take shots in her honor.\n\nWe walked in and named the shot and the bartender looked at us like we were insane. So we just ordered a whiskey and a beer and sat quietly ashamed. \n\nFor a bro bar, it's a pretty cool place. Free popcorn, cheap food, good service. The beer selection wasn't amazing but I'm sure it has what all the college kids want.
4 ||| I don't know what it is (certainly not the food) but I love this place!\n\nPerhaps it's the individual juke boxes, the pie, the sassy waitresses, the 24 hour availability, or the fact that everything here seems to be a hang over cure but I just can not get enough!\n\nI used to live up the street from here and this was definitely my weekend morning hot spot! The food is pretty standard diner food. I've never come here late at night (and probably wouldn't want to) but in the mornings Ritter's is definitely a fantastic spot.
1 ||| When it comes to a haircut, you can either go to a cheap place like Great Clips, or you can spend more money to get a great haircut with a stylist that takes their time. I went to this place for a hair cut assuming that the bigger price tag would mean a great hair cut. Boy was I wrong. \n\nI was greeted kindly by the two ladies at night. Note I stopped short by calling them hair stylists, much the same way I stop short in calling Great Clips employees stylists. For the higher price, I got a quick buzz cut with someone who didn't check to make sure the cut was even. I was in and out of that chair in 5 minutes. For the price, that isn't something I expect.\n\nIf you want to pay more for a similar hair cut to the cheap franchises, THIS is the place to go. You will love it here. For me ... someone who expects a GREAT haircut for a higher price, I'm going someplace else. If I want this type of hair cut, I'm saving money and going to Great Clips.\n\nFor the owner, you need to get rid of the young brunette girl at night. She is terrible as a hair cutter (not stylist), and makes your business look bad.
3 ||| This is what a health food store should be like. Not some supermarket of organic, but a nice local store that carries enough for you to get most of what you want.\n\nI'm only in NC for a month, so I'm not sure what I should expect in the organic produce scene, but this is the one place Berrybrook Farm appears to come up short. They have some, but it's not the freshest. I'm not sure where you get organic produce in Charlotte, but if I find someplace in my next three weeks here I'll let you know :-)
3 ||| Really great experience. Alex was my bartender and waiter and he made it a really pleasant experience. I had the \"twenty year famous shrimp tacos\" and they were excellent.  I live in a coastal town know for its seafood tacos and these, in Phoenix, were as good as any I've had at home.  With a side of green chili Mac and cheese and a spectacular dinner salad (nice touch with the dill) ...awesome meal. I have to admit I've been here a few times before and have not felt as satisfied, but tonight... Wow. It's what have you done for me lately, right? Lately this place rocks.  Btw, the guy next to me just got served the 1/2 chicken and it's pretty dinky. Looks like half a Cornish hen.  Maybe avoid that...
0 ||| Staff needs a little bit more customer service training.  Was asked at the door if my husband and I were celebrating anything and I said yes little early 10 year anniversary and didn't even get a congrats or happy early anniv. Then the waitress we had seemed to be in a hurry and kind of impatient with getting our order and drinks. The water is terrible and didn't even get a lemon when asked for the first time when she took or drink order. Then we get a hamburger and well....... we asked for med/med rare and we got rare....it was so much grease/juice coming out of the burger that the bottom bun was soaked and was not able to eat it.  Small amount of blue cheese.  This is the first place that we meet on a set up blind date and needless to say we won't be coming back.
0 ||| BEWARE\nDo not trust the owner of this business.\nMr Stu. Bloom picked up $12k worth of outdoor drapes from our house in Paradise Valley,AZ....we were doing a renovation and wanted them cleaned ...\nHe never called to tell  us they were ready for pick up...one year later.\nInstead he has been incredibly arrogant and not told us where the drapes are.\nAfter repeatedly ignoring our requests for an explanation, we are now forced to hire a lawyer . \nHe has said he does not care and that the law is on his side ...\nWe think he has sold or destroyed these items.\nThis is a person that feels he is above the law ...He hides from the truth and does not care about his customers ...
1 ||| I really really hate leaving bad reviews but sometimes they are well-deserved.  \n\nThe only positive thing I can say is that the ladies who work here are nice.  What was not nice is the completely jacked up gel nails I got when I stopped here on a whim when my regular lady at Luxury Nails was booked.  The bed of each of my nails had crazy white streaks all over when she was finished. When I pointed it out and asked what the heck it was, she acted like there was nothing there.  It was really noticeable so I don't know why she thought this was the best way to handle it.\n\nThen the entire staff came over and examined my nails and the lady who seemed like the owner explained that it was my crappy real nails.  Yes.  I have crappy real nails, which is why I get gel in the first place!  But I have never had this happen and I've had gel nails for months.  The suggestion was for me to have each of my nails buffed down to paper thin status and re-apply the gel.  This was done with only some improvement.  I left with my nails looking like complete garbage.  They are not even filed right, so even if I was going to buy the argument that this little situation is somehow the fault of my genetics, it does not explain not even filing the ends properly.  \n\nDo NOT go here for gel nails!
3 ||| I dunno...  the rest of the people at my table all had the Pad Thai, and all of them said it was excellent.  I had the seafood panang curry and thought that it was kind of dull and flavorless...  I really didn't like the presentation where I had to kind of help the rice find it's way to the curry and the seafood on the dish.  It looked fantastic, but when you aren't provided a spoon to do any pouring, it becomes a little awkward.\n\nThe service was great.  The iced tea was weird.  No WiFi...  Eh...  I've had better, but this restaurant was very convenient...
2 ||| I wasn't as impressed with Buca as I wanted to be. I'd always thought this place looked a little cheesy  from the outside, but after years of business, I finally decided to try it out with some friends who were celebrating a new job. \n\nBread and drinks were promptly brought to the table, along with a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. We decided to start with the mixed green salad, and added Gorgonzola and prosciutto on the side. Typically when I think of mixed greens, I think of mesclun, arugala, frissae, and other greens. Though I wouldn't expect these particular greens to be served in an Italian restaurant, I don't understand why they considered this salad \"mixed greens\". The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives, and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole. For our main dish, we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni. This is where the experience failed in my mind, as the chicken and peas did not taste fresh, and the sauce was lacking in depth and flavor. It just wasn't as authentic as I was hoping for. \n\nService was fine, but I think I'll be skipping Buca next time I need a fix for Italian.
3 ||| We like Barnes and Noble and go here quite a bit but it could be a lot better.  Good location and plenty of parking space.\nThis place used to be the best place to find music but now that buying music has changed we don't go here for music any more at all.\nTheir movies have always been way overpriced and we have never purchased one here.\nThey should eliminate the music section and just go with books now.\nThey have a great selection of books and magazines and the atmosphere of the place is quite nice.  They also have the special book readings and group gatherings etc which they have plenty of room for.  They do some art displays which they should do more of.  They could use more tables and chairs toward the front of the store and the coffee could be better.  They could also offer more foods and bakery items.\nBottom line is that they seem to be stuck in a funk and need to revamp this place.  It still holds it's own but it wouldn't take much for someone to knock them off the top rung.
1 ||| Something is odd about SouthPark (not just the mall, but the area of the city).  In many parts of Charlotte, a 40-50 year old ranch-style house will run you a hundred thousand dollars, give or take.  Put it in SouthPark, and you can multiply that threefold, even though the streets are more crowded and the lot size is halved.\n\nThrow an aging rock star and his questionable paintings into a gallery and you can charge thousands of dollars for them, while our kids could probably do something similar in a few minutes, and except for fancy frames, you couldn't get a five-spot on a freeway exit.  The only difference is you don't get accosted for trying to actually snap a picture with said rock star if you aren't interested in taking out a mortgage to buy the artwork.\n\nAs to the mall?  Hey, it's a mall.  The stores are nice enough.  Apple aficionados will line up for any reason or no reason at all at the store here.  New iPhone?  Returning what the family member bought as a present so they can get what they really want?  Think Steve Jobs might be stopping by to buy an overpriced ranch house inside the mall?  It's in there.  They even have a Tiffany & Co.  Hear that, Hazel?\n\nJust bring it, because they want it here.  You might want to come pre-approved.
4 ||| The grouper stuffed with crab, and scallops and green beans was delicious! The staff was all very friendly.  Cozy atmosphere.  Would definitely return.
3 ||| If you are looking for respectable New York-style pizza by the slice, Ray's is worth a visit.  If you're only interested in taking down a whole pie, don't fret because you can get that here too.\n\nI have had their cheese slices, sausage slices, mushroom slices, and Sicilian pieces on many occasions.  All of these are good options, especially if you are looking to taste a vestige of New York cuisine.
0 ||| I want to give this place a one star but I dont think it is their problem that I dont like this kind of food-well, not if I'm sober and its 10 AM anyways.  We went in for breakfast, but much to my dismay there were no poached eggs, granola, fresh fruit or yogurt to be seen.  I could have had a burger, but I decided that would start the day in disaster.  I opted for dry toast instead, picked off of Kristen's plate.  All the platters looked really good as lunch food, and they were really authentic, but they need a breakfast menu.
0 ||| I used to browse in Monkee's when it was beside the starbucks in Morrocroft. I hadn't been in since they moved across the parking lot. I've purchased several pairs of shoes from Monkee's and was really happy with the customer service at the old location. I went in to browse yesterday (saturday) and was really disappointed. The girls who work at the store were pretty snotty. They didn't greet me or my sister. It wasn't busy in the store what so ever so there was no excuse. One of the girls was just starring at us as we looked at the raybans. She didn't ask if she could help us or if we liked what we saw. With so many options around southpark to shop, you'd think they would try to show some interest in their customers. I can find the same things in their store that I can find at the mall across the street or at another boutique at Phillips place. I won't be stopping back in and would recommend shoppers look elsewhere for Tory burch, raybans, and other designers.
1 ||| I was excited to book a pedicure here recently since I believe that I had read that they had won some of the \"Best of Madison\" awards for this service in the last few years.  Sorry to say, I've had better pedicures.  The lady I had was really friendly and nice and that was the best part.  The problem was that I left with feet that were still very rough and the polish was applied very messily.  I had polish spots all over my toes.  In addition to that, the person doing my pedicure smudged some of the polish pretty badly on one of my toes.  She was kind enough to redo it, but then smudged it again when she removed the towel from my feet.  I won't get a pedicure here again.  Hopefully I can find another place that does a good job.
3 ||| I have to mention...the customers who come here are chatty and slow.  A lot if them dont decision their financial needs quickly and need a lot of hand holding which slows down the line BUT the tellers are super nice amd patient. WE LOVE CESAR
3 ||| Alright, what am I reviewing here? I wish I was reviewing the decor, which is sleek and very cool. The service which was great, the wine which in this area is incomparable....but I'm not reviewing any of that, I'm reviewing the shrimp scampi pizza, and the linguini with white clam sauce, one of which gave me the rumblies in my tummy, which would not go away until I \"moved\" them out. So yes this review comes from the bowels of my hear...well no, just my bowels. You made them very unhappy. I give you 10 stars for the decor and the wine bar itself, but on the seafood, my bowels give you -9. Insert mad face here...the bowels, not me. It actually tasted pretty good going down.
1 ||| Seriously what is it with furniture salesmen, they're just like car salesmen! So we're looking for a few pieces and have been store hopping. Against my better judgement we went to look in the Room Store. The sales guy was all over us. He said he'll let us look around and he'll check on us later but he's literally following us. Any time we stop to slightly glance at a piece of furniture he quickly comes over to tell us all about the piece. Go away! If I need help I will ask for it. I really hate furniture shopping at these types of stores. The sales people are ridiculously annoying and they sell all the same cheap crap...which you can buy online for even cheaper btw (Amazon, Overstock, Wayfair, Hayneedle). So after about 15 minutes we were done. I'd had enough and we left. Won't return, hopefully...you know when you're hungry but you have nothing to eat in your kitchen but you keep randomly checking your fridge or pantry like something new is going to appear, that's how I am with these damn stores. I always hope for better furniture, and better service but it's always the same bs.
3 ||| This place has become a must go spot for me whenever we visit Vegas.  They generally have very good dinner service, but dim sum is somewhat lacking behind when compared to other places nearby (although still better than those places down in Chinatown).  The ambience is like any other Chinese restaurants, table placements can be too close depends on where you sit, but it's generally clean.  The service has been decent to average.\n\nDim sum in the morning is ok, not good, but still not bad overall compared to Chinatown.  I would rate it somewhere in the middle.  Dinner is the best part of this place, they have a great selection of live seafood and often time there are special deals going for live seafood.  I especially like their fresh live shrimps and lobsters.\n\nOverall this place is a must-go for Chinese seafood dishes during dinner time, but for dim-sum in the morning is definitely a secondary choice.
0 ||| We have NEVER had a togo order that has been correct from here. EVER\n\nI am talking about 9-10 years worth...
4 ||| Just love this place and it's food!  Not only is the food fantastic the service is great.  We never had to go without drinks for too long and everyone there was so nice.  They had free entertainment and it was an all around nice experience.
1 ||| Nothing great to say, nothing terrible. Lunch menu, Pepper Beef-- no better than 2 stars. Won't go again.
3 ||| Went to this store for first couple years living here but have changed to cleaner, better priced stores that have come up.  They are very particular about their bulletin board, and the tack is pretty scarce except for basics like lead lines or halters. They have refused to take coupons from me for Purina, or charged me extra to take a coupon (?!?). The guys in the back are nice for hauling big bags of feed for you. Sometimes they actually recognize you and say HI as if they know you, which is about the only reason I'll go there. Pet supplies are overpriced. Good stop on the way home for milk or beer, quick bag of feed, but can't say I am treated well enough to make them my # 1.
1 ||| In the Wesin Hotel, attached to the David Lawrence Convention Center - this is probably the highest priced, over saturated fried fish establishment that exists in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nNow, they call themselves the \"Orginal\" fish market - but don't let that fool you. This place is an overpriced clone of legal seafood - with a good but overpriced service bar. Seriously.... $26 for two MGD beers and a double Bailey's on the rocks? Oy. Something tells me they want to loose business, rather than keep it. The wine selection is kinda dated, and I don't know the last time they cleaned the wine taps - but it looks to me like something I'd rather avoid- or have the bottle delivered to my table to avoid cross contamination.\n\nThe food, while basicially good (fried seafood) everything - is way overpriced to me. And there is no really good way to put this, but if you're looking for Fish and Chips - cross the street and go the the nearby Tonic restaurant. The portion size and the service are much better.\n\nStill, if you've got an expense account, and don't want to walk out of the convention hotel - yes, this will work for almost anyone. Including the guy who's had one too many and yelling at the bar with another patron.
0 ||| I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review. \n\nListen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.\n\nI'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.\n\nAll in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again.
0 ||| I am an avid Chiptole fan, but never have I had as terrible service as I did today at this location. \n\nI used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch. My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot, ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online, she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then \"went to the back\" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay, after I had already told her I had paid for it online. \n\nThe person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it, that was actually the least of my concerns, that happens, I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location, there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving, mind you, there was no line, which is rare for any Chiptole, so it really made no sense that our service was this poor. \n\nWe asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07. \n\nSo an order I placed at 2:20, was supposed to be ready at 2:45, and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online. \n\nI will not be going to that Chiptole ever again. And will defintely think twice before ordering online with you guys, very disappointing. :(
3 ||| Stopped in for lunch with my two sons.  The last time i visited was over 18 years ago (I don't get to Phoenix all that often).  The outside patio was great, especially for a group from the frozen north who don't sit outside to eat in December.  The menu was adequate, with a good selection for lunch.  Chips and salsa were interesting, mild.  Food was well prepared and portions generous for the price paid.  Service was good.  Overall, a good, but not outstanding experience.
0 ||| Was looking for a new place... Told the stylest what I want and she said okay no problem and spun me to the tv screen. She quickly hacked away at my hair giving me a 7.99 haircut treatment. I was spun back around , now facing the mirror with almost no hair left. I will never visit again.
3 ||| So far I like it.
3 ||| I loved this place except for the limited choices.  But I think if there were more options, it might mean more people, a longer wait and REALLY no place to sit.  \n\nIt may be off of a nasty busy street, but sitting at the picnic table under the sun eating my sandwich, I felt like I was somewhere else.  I figured out on my second trip to get an ice tea next door at Lux....free refills!
1 ||| Below average bagels. Eggs had no taste. Fast service.
3 ||| When I am hungry for Chinese take-out, I go to Abacus Inn. Located just west of I-10 on Elliot in the Safeway/Walgreens shopping center, Abacus Inn is convenient to most Ahwatukee residents. I've enjoyed the beef with broccoli, sizzling rice soup, however my favorite is the moo shu pork with plum sauce.  Service is super quick. They are always polite. I often have a half-off coupon for second entree since those coupons are in the mail frequently. Its economical even without.
4 ||| Vegas Ramen Quest #3 of 3 days in a row...  This restaurant stood out.  Not for the ramen, but for all its other dishes.  \n\nFantastic Japanese restaurant with a huge variety of offerings.  Peruse the menu, browse pics on Yelp and find yourself reading all the litter on the walls, featuring everything else you'd like to order.  This, was annoying.  Lovely decor, but Monkey don't want to read the walls to figure out what to order, especially when trying to read over other tables.  There are Yelp pictures of stuff we wanted that are not on the menu.  Server was very helpful to narrow down what it was we were looking for.  \n\n#91 RAMEN DX - good, but still falls below Monkey's Gold Standard of Ramen, LA's Daikokuya.  In fact, I'm writing this 2 weeks later and I can't remember anything worth mentioning about this ramen. \nYELLOWTAIL TARTARE - Now this blew our minds when it arrived to our table!  Order it and be amazed.  There are bottles of wine we reserve to celebrate with, this dish my wife insists I only order with her.  \nFRIED OYSTERS - Monkey don't do fried oysters and this didn't change my mind\n#45 BEEF TONGUE SKEWER - This arrived first.  Savory, chewy, delicious.  Think marinated beef chewing gum.  Can you imagine?  Monkey loved masticating this sliver of cow tongue. Ever see a monkey make out with a cow?  Loved it so much we ordered another skewer to finish us off, instead of dessert\n#87 BROILED RICE BALLS - If you love the toasted rice at the bottom of your stone pot bibimbap, you will absolutely order this.  Imagine two tennis ball-sized triangles of rice, toasted crisp on all sides and probably brushed with soy sauce.  Fantastic, but oh too salty for Monkey.  Will definitely order again with less salt.  \n\nOpen every day 230pm - 3AM ! ! !  Great place for after drinking/partying or sampling different items while drinking...  Monkey cannot wait to return!
0 ||| I order frame Angelo's regularly .Quality in going downhill.First I waited on hold for 10min ,so I drive over and I'm still on hold,I go in there's one person inside and no orders ..WTF am I holding for .?...So my order is $30+ and I asked for a ranch and of course I have to pay for it ?Then I get my white pizza home and it looks like it was in a tornado,this seems to be happening more often..and delivery don't get me started.My rating is PISS POOR!!!
2 ||| After posting about the terrible service I received, today I received a check and a gift certificate.  Way to go Village Cleaners!  I feel better.  Could have been all avoided if they had just paid my cleaning bill, but this is nice.
2 ||| Inventory is great, but the prices are higher than most gun stores in the area.  Customer service is ok.
1 ||| Horrible job. I got a mani/pedi and I could have done a better job myself. I know sometimes they can accidently cut your skin, but she took a huge chunk out of my cuticle then tried telling me I had a hang nail.... um I think not idiot. The paint job was horrible... the whole nail wasn't even covered. Pricing was alright, service horrible.
2 ||| The Holidays are coming and in the 'British' section they are not selling Vegeta seasoning anymore.
4 ||| It's a typical Wendy's. It's hidden in the corner so be sure to look to your right as soon as you get off the highway.\n\nI stopped in for a quick lunch. I ordered the new Smokey Honey Mustard flat bread with fries and a strawberry lemonade.\n\nIt was full on lunch rush, so the drive thru was packed. To avoid the wait, I opted to go inside. The place was clean; but unfortunately for me it was still packed with people! But the good news is that they were very well staffed to accommodate the hungry lunch crowd. \n\nAfter I ordered my food, it was ready pretty quickly. I actually really enjoyed the entire meal! It's a multi-grain flat bread so it adds really good flavors. I've had a lot of flat bread from other places but this one is by far one of my favorites. The chicken and spring mix combined with the honey mustard had a really had a great taste. The honey mustard wasn't too sweet which I was really pleased with, and just like the name said it added a great smokey flavor.\n\nThere was just the right amount of everything on this sandwich and the best part was that the french fries were hot. And I'm really starting to become a fan of their strawberry lemonades. It's the regular lemonade but with really a delicious strawberry syrup mix. No need to say anything more than it's delicious! \n\nOverall, it was a solid visit and meal. I enjoyed everything and I'm sure to be back.
3 ||| I do like tasty burgers. I normally get chicken sandwiches at fast food restaurants, but the place has \"burgers\" in the menu, so I thought \"why not?\". I'm glad I went with my gut here. I simply had the single burger but it was definitely enough to fill me up! My 15 mo son had yet to eat a hamburger before today, and he ate his whole slider! My husband had the Cowboy burger and it was huge and delicious. Prices are extremely reasonable for what you get. The atmosphere was fun, too. Only 4 stars because we got a drink and filled the cup with Sobe, and it tasted waaaay watered down.
3 ||| Stopped here today for lunch with my grandmother. Had a grilled chicken sandwich. and a California burrito. We went drive thru which was a little on the slow side. However our was correct and we got alot of food for the money. The staff was friendly and got our order correct.
1 ||| Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores.  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \n\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\n\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.
1 ||| So I recently rented a car from my local Hertz.  This was my fourth time renting from this particular Hertz and every time the service is absolutely perfect and prices are good.  I couldn't let this crappy place go on with my 3 star review.  In light of my new excellent experience I must demote this place to 2 stars.  The Hertz location is in SF, check my other reviews if you wanna see...
0 ||| This place is a joke.  The girls that were handling the cover wouldn't give me my money back from being in that place for only 1 min...   They weren't apologetic at all... On top of that, no one was in there.
2 ||| Well if you like corn tortillas you're fine.  The menu is expensive for what you get, and bland.  Zero flavor in the chicken fajitas.  On a positive note, the service was great... To bad the food wasn't.
2 ||| Our family of five just stayed at the Gainey Ranch for 5 nights and had a great time overall.  I was torn between a 4 and 3 rating but the high daily fee and charges for Internet access made me lean towards a three.  Here is what I would say are the pros and cons:\n\nPros: nice rooms, comfortable beds, great maid service. Restaurant was a '4', good food and not as overpriced as I would have expected.  Location worked out great for us, we went hiking and horse back riding 15-30 minutes north of the hotel and went to dinner in the downtown area just 10 minutes away.  Pool was great fun for the kids albeit as others mentioned a bit dirty.\n\nCons: we had two rooms so paid 40 per night on 'resort fees' and I could not think of one benefit we got from the fee.  They overcharged me for 12 for 'resort recreation' that I need to inquire about as we never rented any recreation items.  The Internet charges on top of a resort fee are just ridiculous, if this is the norm for all Hyatt hotels I will avoid them in the future.  The bigger con for us outside of the Internet fees was the rooms are not sound proofed at all.  Our neighbors got up at 5am every morning and we could hear their entire conversation.  The Hyatt also had a nightly concert/band (likely what our resort fee covered) and unfortunately the music was so loud we could not relax and read or watch.  The Hyatt should have forewarned us we would have been situated in a room right on top of loud music.  I would say bathrooms were a con too, one of our rooms had a standard showerDand the other had a very small bathtub shower/combo.\n\nIt was a nice hotel but I would not stay again unless I knew they had concerts and started offering free wireless.
4 ||| Friendly personable staff, good food, great place to grab whatever you need in a hurry.
0 ||| I have never in my life had such horrible customer service! I ate here tonight with my husband and two kids. When we got our order we noticed that we were missing a burrito. My husband approached the counter and kindly mentioned to them what we were missing and the woman behind the counter, Cynthia, was totally rude and snapped at my husband and argued that she put it on our tray. My husband explained that he did not see it and she rudely said that she would make us another one. A few minutes later she storms to our table and slams down our tray with the missing burrito and points at another burrito on our tray and yells, \"See there it is right there!\" She then stormed off and glared at us and gave us a dirty look. My husband and I were so upset we left without finishing our meal and went home and called the customer service number and left a message explaining what had happened. I have never ever had to call a customer service number to complain! Ever! I will never go back to this location again and \"Cynthia\" needs a new job!!
3 ||| The wife and I took the kids here for Valentine's day.\n\nComing from Chicago, I'm a bit of a pizza snob. Chicago deep dish pizza is THE only way to go. It's a meal, you eat pizza with a fork and a knife. Not that paper plate crap. It's about the crust. That buttery flaky tasty goodness... mmm... I can feel my arteries clogging as I write. \n\nThe reviews that I read, led me to believe that Nello's would be the place I've been searching for, since moving to AZ over 6 years ago. As their motto states, \"In crust, we trust\", so I took it as gold and I trusted their crust. Boy, was I disappointed. We got the heart shaped \"Valentines Special\", with their signature crust, half cheese and half pepperoni. \n\nLet me reiterate, I am a pizza snob and I have high expectations for great pizza. Sadly, this was just mediocre. It was pizza that I would get if I only had $5, was pulling an all nighter and needed a quick pizza. The crust was dried out. Not buttery. Not flakey. Not tasty. In fact, my kids and I didn't even finish the crust; which is my favorite part of a pizza.\n\nThe ambiance was great. The decor, lighting, bar and even the seating was comfy and inviting. The staff was excellent as well. So, as for what might bring me back, it's the staff.\n\nIn the end, it's an okay place. I'll probably come back sometime to give it another try. It really has potential and has received a ton of awards, so maybe I just caught an off night.
0 ||| Horrible customer service..Never expect the cab to be in time.. They cannot tell when they can assign a driver and we have been stranded for around 2 hours till a cab finally decides to arrive
0 ||| Played Aliante again after my buddies had a coupon and invited me out. The course is now managed by Troon golf. It is in awful shape and it was $59, which for a resident is about twice what it should be. The pro shop attendant was rude when I asked about and OB discount. Will not go back. Sad because I used to take my grandpa there when he visited.
1 ||| I was here at the Pamela's in Shadyside a few weeks ago - dining companion and I were looking for a nice brunch-y place to visit. Naturally, with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's, we gave it a shot.\n\nI have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?\n\nMy companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place, but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.\n\nAfter perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it.\n\nMy companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.\n\nMy crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.\n\nOverall, we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's. Our search for a good brunch place continues.
3 ||| This is a eclectic little coffee shop in an area that seems to have a lot of competition for the coffee drinkers in that part of town. There are three shops in this area. \n\nThey were hopping despite the lateness of the hour (8:30) on a weeknight.  The service was friendly but not too fast. I didn't mind though. The girl helping me was very knowledgeable about what different drinks they offered which were sans caffeine. \n\nOverall, a great experience!
0 ||| TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT! - Over a year after I quit working at this IHOP because of terrible management. I called in a to-go order for my boyfriend and I - When I got there, I ended up having issues with my debit card so I ended up running across the street to pull money out of the bank. When I got back, I asked Jenelle, the manager, if I could have my food warmed up cause it was cold and she approached me with an atrocious attitude, and told me nope and walked off. So I said, alright, forget it, and left the $30.00 in food and walked out the door. I will never eat there again because I've come to the conclusion that there food gets cold and hard almost immediately.
3 ||| Several years ago I grew weary of our movie-every-weekend habit. Not so much the price, though that was part of it. Just the whole idea of being in a dark room with so many strangers I think...\n\nI would much rather wait to catch a flick on DVD so I can watch from the comfort of my couch while chomping on my own air-popped corn and chugging as much cold peppermint tea as I want without worrying about how much it's costing me.\n\nHowever I have caught a few here and there at local places. \n\nStarlight is one I prefer because it's not at a mall. Something about the idea of a stand-alone theater comforts me.\n\nThis one is a little worn and faded but that's okay. Staff has been pleasant each time I've gone, it's not too far from home, and the parking has been plentiful.\n\nPrices for snacks are on par with other theaters in the area. (They do have that little discounted snack pack deal which is cool for those of us on a budget.)\n\nMy daughter and I plan to catch \"Abe Lincoln\" here soon but it will be a matinee.\n\nHere's to keeping costs down while still contributing to our consumerist economy!
2 ||| Went to this place 2 months ago and was so excited to go back a couple weeks ago. That was until I received my Shrimp Diavolo and the shrimp were butterflied but NOT de-veined. In my opinion, there's no excuse for that in any half way decent restaurant now a days.  I pushed the shrimp aside and tried to finish my meal. Was so disappointed. The live music was good and service was great.
2 ||| While the shop is in a pretty great location, with cute decor, they only accept cash (which is annoying), and the friendliness of the staff varies significantly, from awesome to terrible. I could deal with either--and have, given my love of coffee shops--but I guess I need consistency. I want to know what to expect, you know?\n\nTheir coffee is pretty good--not awesome, but certainly drinkable. Their pastries vary a bit, as well; that they offer carrot cake cupcakes is pretty cool, but I think something's wrong with their fridge, making things stale half the time.\n\nKind of meh.\n\n(Note on \"outdoor seating:\" It's really no good unless you smoke, because there's one employee who spends half the day out there, smoking.)
0 ||| Service was par, food was terrible. The food had no flavor at all. Got the chicken salad sandwich with potato salad. Both equally bland and horrible. Didn't even eat 1/4 of it. Even the \"homemade\" were disappointing.  Wasted $$. Will not try again
1 ||| I have lived here for about 5 months, the place is okay i guess, the ground are clean which I like, but the staff seems kinda disorganized.. they got our move in dates wrong which thank god I'm an early mover and didn't wait to the last min, then when we FINALLY moved in, we got a different apt than we were showed originally. The linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it. Which okay whatever i guess is not that big of a deal but then I found out we pay more for our water because its not divided out between everyone else. Also EVERYTHING breaks our shower has broken twice, the closet light broke out the wall, the bathroom light fell out of the wall, the kitchen stove and the washer has all broke from the time we moved in (Last May). the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart! When I go in the office i feel they always try and rush me out because i can finish my questions its really annoying. So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live.
0 ||| The service at this location is slow, the prices are outrageous, the food is totally sub-par, the drinks are always made super duper weak, and they close really early. I don't suggest coming here for a good time. The servers are nice, but I would suggest going to a more delicious location.
3 ||| For $25 you can get THE WORKS.  I was a little sketched out to go in, but I did.  The place is a little dinky, on the corner of Decatur and Charelston.  But the price is right and the people are friendly.  They have a few different options to choose from, from just the basics to a wax. I chose the third most expensive.  This included the outside, a polish, wheels, and all of the inside including the dashboards.  I waited about 15 minutes, the place wasn't that crowded.  $25 for the works, plus a tip, not bad for a clean car!
0 ||| I waited an hour and a half for my car, from 9:30pm to 11,  on a humid Wednesday night in a waiting area that seemed to have no A/C. Staff was wildly disorganized, frazzled and, despite numerous questions from the room full of understandably frustrated customers, never gave a straight answer as to the exact nature of the problem. Employees behind the counter would disappear for 20, 30 minutes with no explanation. I finally confronted the manager as to why they had plenty of cars sitting idle over in the Gold Club section but were parceling out cars to us non-Gold people at a rate of 1 every 20 minutes! 30 minutes later, I was given a car in the Gold parking area. To be fair, my previous handful of experiences with Hertz at CLT were trouble free, but this experience has made me gun shy about using them ever again.
3 ||| A recipient of many awards and much praise, I'm not quite sure what took me so long to visit Lulu's. It's quaint and cute. There was Spanish music on the radio and a silent Syracuse- Notre Dame college hoops game on the flat screen in the corner. It was a nice setting for dinner.\n\nWe ordered beef, a lot of it. We got the taco platter- ground beef tacos accompanied with rice and beans and a carne asada burrito. I enjoyed it all and immensely. The tacos were moist and the shells were crisp. The flavor on the rice and beans was just as tasty too. The burrito, which I was only allowed to nibble, was also delish- pico de gio, guacamole, beans, cheese and lettuce accompanied the carne. It was piping hot and exuded freshness. The only negative was that it was a bit greasy.\n\nIt was a bit on the pricey side and there's a charge for drink refills-- a mere 70 cents, but knowing the way I can woof down a coke along with Mexican food had me a bit turned off. However, the man behind the counter waived the charge for us which was a pleasant surprise. He was friendly and the food was fast.
3 ||| Food is great I can't say much for the service and the hostess who upon arriving welcomed us with a \"what!\"
3 ||| Fresh Pizza Tons of Choices! I had Garlic- Parmesan wings. 9\" Meat Trio Pizza! \n\nLOVED - LOVED - LOVED - LOVED \n \nGARLIC PARMESAN WINGS!! \n\nHelpful Staff\n\nUnique Pizza Combinations \n\nDISLIKED - DISLIKED - DISLIKED \n\nIt was totally my fault, but I didn't eat my pizza fast enough and it changed the texture and taste of the crust..
4 ||| oh my gosh these pizza's are huge! i love a good pie with everything on it (minus anchovies) and these are as good as it gets.
3 ||| I used to go to the Steak and Hoagie / Grekos at Sharon Amity and Monroe until they closed due to road construction 2 years ago. I had seen the one on Eastway but its not the greatest part of town and about 5 miles from my business. Today it popped into my head and myself and 5 coworkers decided to try it. This place is going on the lunch rotation! Rotisserie Chicken - awesome, Greek salad- excellent, roasted potatoes- greasy and delicious. According to coworkers the chicken parm sandwich and cheesesteak were also good as was the Grecian chicken. They didn't have the Teriyaki chicken today but if my memory serves me it was fantastic. The prices are from 1995. 1/4 Chicken 2 sides and garlic bread $5.85. Great food, large portions, very reasonable price.
0 ||| I was treated very poorly by the front desk employee. She was extremely rude and unprofessional. I just can not handle extremely poor customer service. I would only go if I had no other place to go. They will not be getting my business.
3 ||| Murphy's Pub really is a great college bar.  It tends to have a rather diverse mix of people, isn't usually overly loud and a great value.  The drink specials are quite good and the choices on tap are plentiful.\n\nFood is good for bar food, definitely get the Irish nachos sometime.  There really isn't anything Irish about them, but they are delicious.
0 ||| They may help in the short term but trust me you will pay for it in the long term! Take your wallet and whats left of your spine and get outta there!!!!! My neurosurgeon says \"they are performing witch craft\". Do not I repeat do not get talked into the PRP and the Stem Cell it is BS!!!!! Definitely do not get a discogram it is excutiatingly painful and prooves jack shit according to the neurosurgeons. They sent me home and did not even check up on me ever!!   I tried these guys for over 2years and I am way worse off because of it.  They misdiagnosed me and did extremely Painfull expensive unnecessary  so called treatments, all while lying and manipulating me because they new I could afford their expensive procedures. I feel like Dr.Komars personal ginnie pig. Plus thier front desk staff is RUDE. I Hate this place!!!!! I'm writing this because I think people in to know this information.
0 ||| I DO NOT recommend this Jeweler based on their very poor customer service. I brought in three rings: two to be polished and a silver ring to be downsized by a quarter. Whitney said casually when I was in the store \"it shouldn't be too expensive.\"  Well, charging me $150 to downsize a silver ring by .25 is more expensive than the cost of the ring. Charging me $150 to polish two very small rings is ridiculous when other places do just as good of a job for $40 or less.  When my husband called asking for explanations on pricing, the manager of the store for 30 some odd years told him she would roll back the security tape to show us a little sign in the store stating their hourly rate is $78 and then hung up on him. \n\nIf this is how they treat customers for small services like polishing ($150) and resizing ($150) rings I would not trust them with any of my other jewelry needs.  \n\nBackground: we are young professionals with experience with various jewelers in the U.S. where we have lived.  We don't have unreasonable expectations and are nice people wanting to support small local businesses.  This business is a bad representation of small local Wisconsin businesses.\n_____________\nUPDATE:  The Studio Jewelers Response to my review is mostly false.  It inaccurately describes the conversations that took place and the interactions between myself, my husband, and them.  They are accusing an unhappy customer of attempting to blackmail them, which should tell you a lot about them frankly.  I have notified Yelp of the falsified information in their response which obviously does not follow Yelp's guidelines.
1 ||| Capital City Transfer handled my move from Madison, WI to New York, NY. Overall I am extremely disappointed with the customer service provided by the team.\n\nThe good:\nThe actual moving team was very quick, getting everything out of my 2 bedroom apartment in about 1.5 hours (I had everything packed and ready before they arrived).\n\nThe bad:\nOn move out day, the crew was late. After repeated calls to our sales rep (Scott aka \"Scooter\") they finally showed up about 3 hours late. Then the real problems started. The shipment was packed and sent to get a final weight, with final price based on the weight. After arriving in NY, I called to check on the final price. I spoke with a polite but clueless girl at the desk, who promised Scooter would call me back that afternoon. No such luck. I continue calling multiple times a day. ELEVEN (yes, 11) days later, Scooter finally calls with the price, and no update on the delivery, with the delivery window closing in just two days (delivery was contracted between the 6th and 17th of the month). \n\nFinally, I get a call from a driver. He asks if I have obtained parking permits for the delivery. I explain that Manhattan does not have parking permits for moving (something I thought a national moving company would know, or 30 seconds on the NYDOT website could have told him). He then tells me that he won't take my shipment, because he got a parking ticket once in New York, and didn't want to \"deal with it.\" I was shocked he would say such a thing to a customer. After several calls to the customer service line on the 16th and 17th, someone finally called me back to say the shipment would not arrive until the 21st at the earliest.
2 ||| It's a movie theatre. I mean, you show up, buy tickets, watch a movie. They do a great job of this. They are even 50 cents per ticket cheaper than the larger Harkins Theatres in the area as well.\n\nThe place isn't glamorous or all that big as it's one of the older locations. However, that makes it far less popular so you don't have to arrive as far in advanced as you would with the bigger more popular theaters. It also shows a lot of the smaller/indie films which can be a gem.
0 ||| I just never understand how people can think this cafe is so great.  My folks regularly eat here, but every single time I have gone, I have been very disappointed with the quality of their food.  I was there yesterday (with my folks) and ordered 1/2 grilled cheese and a bowl of French Onion soup.  My sandwich was cold, cheese not melted, and my soup had unmelted square cheese sticking out the bottom.  It was barely hot.  My Mom had the fish and chips and she said it was the worst fish ever.  When we left the place, it was packed.  I guess I simply look for good food, prepared to order, and served hot.  Not my favorite place, and I think it was my last visit.
0 ||| I wish there were zero stars. I had TWC for several years and they were always a pain. Internet service was shoddy, they throttle speed,  they bully you into cable subscriptions to keep themselves relevant, and they just gave us a $125 unreturned equipment fee for equipment that I did in fact return. They have odd hours,  and if you move you have to physically bring the box to their office. And guess what?  No after hours drop box,  so your only option is to take time out of your work day. AT&T is much better. Avoid TWC like the plague. They'll never stop nickel and diming you.
3 ||| Brats is the place to go on game day on your way to the stadium or to go to watch a packers game. They have been a staple in Madison since my parents went to school there in the 80s, so you know that they are doing something right! The food there is decent,  you best choices are the brats, they have red brats and white brats and their seasoned waffle fries are delicious. \n\nWhile this is a great bar with lots of fun stuff to do, sometimes the crowd is a bit hit or miss depending on the night that you go. To truly get the best State Street Brat experience you need to go on a busy night.
0 ||| Had very positive experience with Houston's in the past. This wasn't good. They seemed to not have much that was on the menu (e.g. Out of grilled Artichokes, and only had two desserts; hot fudge sundae and berries with mascarpone.  Service was decent but felt that $100+ for a salad, a rotisserie chicken and a couple of drinks seemed like a lot. And nothing like other Houston's I've been to before. Much more like a TGI Fridays. \n\nWas told the sushi menu was discontinued since Hillstone opened across town. \n\nAs I've said previous experience has always been pretty great for Houston's. Just don't come to this one.
4 ||| After frequenting this place many times I've decided to up my rating from a 4 to 5 due to the consistency of what I feel is great service and really awesome Thai food. Personally I really dig their fried rice and curry. Their menu is huge and so far I've been very happy with everything I've tried so that's a nice testament to the places quality. I'd also like to throw some love to the two beautiful hostess that have always been so sweet and accommodating when I've visited as well. They've always made the visit so pleasant every-time for me.
0 ||| Often rumored to have the best Chinese food in the Madison area, this restaurant is a major disappointment. My spicy tofu and vegetables dish was not in the least spicy and the tofu was only fried and would have been better marinated. The entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par. The service was very quick and the food served very quickly, maybe too much so. Madison has great Southast Asian restaurants, but I definitely won't be eating more Chinese food  anywhere here.
0 ||| This store has set hideous customer service standards! I was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over! They gave me the run around when I asked to speak to a manager...she was conveniently never present and was the \"only one who could help me.\" When giving me the final verdict on my issue, she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone (of course not face to face) and could not even call me herself. I highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters!
0 ||| Restaurant was very dirty inside. The manager taking our order got it wrong 3 times. They've got 7 people working and still can't keep chicken ready to serve. Waited 7 minutes just to place our order to find out they had none and it would be another 15 minutes to cook some more. The spicy chicken strips (while had good flavor)  were extremely dry and small (more like large chicken nuggets). The green beans were cold, the large mashed potatoes were only half full and their soda tasted like the machine had not been cleaned in a few months. Very disappointing.
1 ||| When I need a more specialized pet item or food that I can't get at Safeway/Target/Walmart I come here.  On this trip I needed some enzyme based cleaner to treat an area some stinky stray cat keeps marking on my patio and I decided to transition my 14lb kitty from Iams Indoor Hairball/Weight Management to a more high protein food, Blue Buffalo Wilderness which they carry.  \nI have found that some of the items here are a tad pricier than the Target/Walmarts but they do have a bigger selection.  But I often find myself coming here if not in the mood to brave either location.
3 ||| Ahh the joys of living in Phoenix.  The cheery voice taking my order let me know about the 1-1:15 hour delivery wait.  I just had to try something different than Dominos.  Guess what?  Dominos is actually better and $10 less than my overpriced $32 pizza/meatball sandwich meal.  This has solidified my opinion that the best pizza in Phoenix is still Spinatos.  \n\nThe NYPD meatballs had a taste that could not be recognized; if these are meatballs, then they should be renamed spicy bready dough balls.  The pizza was a little warm when I got it and certainly not thin crust.  So many pizza places lie about \"thin crust\" that the next time I'm going to ask how thin?\n\nThe cheesecake was actually the best part of it; next time, skip the pizza and just order dessert for lunch!
3 ||| Attention teen-dream girls working the front desk: customer service is meant to involve the customer, not exclude them. Stop your conversation with each other or put down your iPhone and say hi. Don't just grab my keys and avoid eye contact with the members. \n\nThe facility itself is great but the people or should I say kids working there need work. Try smiling and making eye contact. I would like to commend the class instructors, they are nice but only mean when needed to motivate of you catch my drift.\n\nService Level - 2 stars (raised due to trainers / instructors)\nFacility (excluding the \"teen dreams\") - 4-5 stars
3 ||| Happy Hour now starts an hour earlier from 3-6 pm. \n\nDon't try the stuffed mushrooms, they were really salty. They have a pretty good creme brulee too. \n\nStill love the food and the atmosphere of the downstairs bar. \n\nWhen we walked out I noticed that they have a dinner special for 2 written on the chalk board just before you walk into the restaurant. You each get to choose a cut of beef (I think there were about 4-5 to chose from), a salad, and a side (about 4-5 to choose from also) for $36. Sounds like a great deal. We'll have to come back and try it out.
0 ||| Yesterday about 3 in the afternoon the wife and I went in for a late lunch since I had to go to work in a hour or so. I open the door and it's heavy like it's spring loaded, we step in and sure enough the door slams behind us with a loud bang! Ooops I thought and I see the waitress cleaning the booths on the far wall, even with that loud booming door slam she didn't even acknowledge us, back turned to us and not even any eye contact or \"hello, I'll be with you in a moment\"  We take a table and still no welcome what so ever. We are both looking at her and she goes on wiping tables and not a glance our way. She is actually cleaning the rest of the booths and continues to ignore us. My wife says, \"lets get out of here\" and I thought so too, but I needed to eat before I went to work and so we stayed. I had to yell out, \"could we get a couple menus?\" and the waitress was really unwelcoming and cold. I am like, what in the world is she doing serving tables? Maybe she is working two jobs and is really burned out or someone pissed her off recently? but we are the only ones in the place.  As we looked over the menu some other people came in and she again acted like she didn't want to serve anybody. I've had better service at Carls Jr. and if they weren't a few miles away we would have went there instead.\nThe burgers were good and a 1/2 pound double was too much for our appetites. Fries were excellent and the cook with the black cap back there is doing a great job on the food. The waitress circled our table a few times, but never spoke to us to ask how everything was luckily my wife somehow got a refill on her drink. When she circled around us, I asked for our check and she was grovelling to herself and replied back like, \"I\"LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU AS SOON AS I COME BACK\"  We left a few dollars tip and with that cold treatment from the waitress we over tipped in our opinion. People like that should not be serving food, we liked the food, but will never be back considering the unfriendly waitress.
0 ||| Got a full set today and they look so bad. So many flaws. The polish is sloppy. They don't look neat and clean.
0 ||| Worse $15 I have ever spent.   A joke of a pedicure. Little to no massage and the buffing of my feet was terrible.  They might be worse now.  Save your $15 for the delicious sushi next store.
3 ||| Yay!!!! I've finally found a decent Vietnamese restaurant in North Scottsdale.  I had the PHO (customized the way I like it) and a sandwich.  Both were really good!  Very reasonably price and the service couldn't be faster.  I just wish they had a bigger menu but they have the basics so I will be back for sure!
4 ||| We are regular customers of Osaka Japanese Bistro on Eastern in Henderson NV, we saw they has a special Groupon for Teppanyaki for four. We decided why not? It was FANTASTIC the food was excellent ,Sake was warm and delicious , Asahi (Japanese Beer for those who don't know) was cold and crisp. Our Teppan Chef was hilarious and attentive to every detail. He engaged my 13 yr old daughter in a witty banter and had her as his foil. She enjoyed the show and food tremendously. My husband and her salmon was cooked to perfection, our Japanese fried rice was light and extremely delicious. My rib eye was rare perfectly cooked and expertly seasoned. We had sushi and sashimi for appetizers all were excellent and fresh. Definately an experience we will seek to duplicate in the future! I highly recommend Osaka, the staff are well versed and polite and the food is divine. Live Jazz on Thursday also!!
4 ||| I love the Radisson!!!
0 ||| It's a like a stampede when you enter this store! The least of the problem is the other shoppers, but the staff are gruff and unfriendly. Wasn't worth it for me.
3 ||| As we rode in the back seat of the car down a street in Buckeye that I can't remember the name of, I saw a bunch of neon glowing around a building in the distance.  I asked the man driving, \"What's that off in the distance there?\"\n\nHe looked slightly confused for a second. \"With all the neon?\"\n\nThe neon was pretty much the only thing you could see across the dark desert night. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's a Sonic,\" he said.\n\nNow, I live in Chicago. I see commercials near everyday for Sonic, but there aren't any within 100 miles of here. Why they torture Chicagoans with images of yummy food, tasty drinks, and ice cream desserts that we would have to travel for hours upon hours to get, I know not. Here was my chance though. I could finally have some Sonic. I asked him to stop there, and he did.\n\nIt's a 50s-inspired drive-in! I don't see too many drive-ins around anymore. You pull into a spot next to a menu with a speakerbox. You place your order. A person who works there brings it out to you on a special tray that goes over your window. Very cool.\n\nWe got burgers and a corndog and sundaes and other stuff too. It was all good. The service was good. I greatly enjoyed my first Sonic experience, and I look forward to getting to one again on future travels.
0 ||| This tgiFridays is horrible. The food was horrible.  The appetizer jack Daniels chicken was like little bricks.  Fries were cold. thumbs down. Don't go here on a game day. There's no happy hour which is why we went. Thumbs down. There's no all you can appetizers cause of the game. Left paying over 70.00 for sodas and 2 meals. Thumbs Down.
0 ||| I unfortunately needed to bring my dog to the EAC yesterday morning.  She was having labored breathing.  They were able to take her in right away which I appreciated very much.  The young lady at the front desk was kind and updated me periodically.  \nDr. Tessarov, however, really needs to work on his bedside manner.  He was initially concerned about congestive heart failure but also thought noncardiogenic pulmonary edema could be the cause for her distress.  He advised hospitalizing her and keeping her on oxygen which was going to be very expensive.  I fully understood the severity of her condition but wanted to speak to my veterinarian first and when I told him that I was going to take my dog with me he looked at me point blank and said if you do nothing your dog will die.  I work in the veterinary field and was angered by just how rude and insensitive he was.  I didn't appreciate being made to feel as though I was a terrible person for making the decision I did.  That being said, my veterinarian was kind enough to meet me on Easter Sunday and we made a treatment plan for my girl.  She IS still alive and we have an appointment today with a cardiologist.  \nI really hope I don't have to make another trip to the EAC anytime soon but if I do I will certainly look for any other place but this one.
1 ||| I wanted to switch to this drycleaners since it's 2 blocks from my house.  I'm currently using one 2 miles away.. a really good, consistent one.  I launder all my business shirts and pants for travel and really need them done well.  I can't afford to be on the other side of the country and then find out the drycleaners made a mistake or didn't do a good job with clothes I need to wear that day.  I took these guys two business shirts to test them, gave specific instructions to clean, medium starch, folded for travel.  Went to pick up the test shirts today.. they did the first two but shirts were given back hanging on hangers..ug...I reminded her I ask for them to be folded for travel.  She ask am I sure.  \nIt was her I have those instructions to.  She offered to fold them then, I said no, give me my shirts and left.  So much for find a new consistent cleaners close to home..bummer.Guess I'll stick with John's over on McClintock near Southern. They don't make these mistakes...
3 ||| I think I have now eaten at & reviewed all the open Souper Salads in the Valley, & I'm lowering this one by one Star only because it's one where I like the layout a little less than my favorites.  With that said, I think the \"worst\" Souper Salad holds its own against most other Valley restaurants with their uniformly delicious food, good service, & very low prices!  You really can't go too far wrong here.     :-))
1 ||| I was a bit disappointed with the pizza I got. I ordered the Milano special pizza, which had pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again.
4 ||| ...And now I know what Italian food is supposed to taste like.\n\nIf there's one thing I hate, it's when I can make any style of food better than a restaurant that supposedly specializes in it. A Filipino kid born in Texas should NOT be able to make better Italian food than venues that claim mastery over the cuisine, and yet more often than not -- at least here in Arizona -- that has been the case. Even at good restaurants, my food was at least comparable in quality. Not the case here -- not even close. Roma Garden laughs at my cooking. Roma Garden's power level is over 9000. All my base are belong to Roma Garden. \n\nAfter reading the glowing reviews from both Hilary K. and Gabi M., I rallied to get my family to eat here in celebration of my sister's graduation. Inconspicuously nestled in a strip mall where it shares a wall with a Panda Express, Roma Garden does not look like the kind of place that would serve some of the best Italian food in Arizona. The interior is far nicer than the outside suggests. It's very cosy, but the unusually large chairs make it a tad difficult to get seated. Entry into the seat closest to the wall was akin to scooting across the seat in a booth. We had little issue with this because none of had to use the restroom during our visit, but I imagine that this would be quite annoying for tables with more active bladders.\n\nThe whole menu looks rather large, but in reality a lot of the dishes are just repeats of other dishes, but with different proteins. Not a complaint, just a note.\n\nWe started off with the calamari, because it tends to be a good indicator of a restaurant's style. The calamari were breaded slightly more than I would have liked, but I prefer a very light breading. By traditional standards, I'm sure these were just fine. Not the best I've had, but definitely good.\n\nMy braised lamb shank, on the other hand, was stellar. The shank was cooked perfectly -- braised just enough to maintain its integrity, while requiring very little coaxing to remove from the bone. The uncomplicated flavor of the lamb worked so well with the chianti-tomato sauce, and pasta on the side was great, too. Our waiter said they make their own pasta, although I'm not sure that if the pasta I ate was homemade. No matter. The sauce killed. The lamb killed. My culinary hubris: massacred.\n\nMy sister had the osso bucco; my mom had the pollo Roma Garden; and my dad had the shrimp scampi. All the dishes on the table looked equally appetizing, but I can't say I'd have ordered differently if I could go back and do it again. My dish was just too awesome.\n\nWe finished the night with some tiramisu, which, while not a revelation, was very good. I enjoy mine with a hint of rum in it, but my whole family enjoyed it, and so I was overall happy with it.\n\nService was very friendly. Our server, whose name unfortunately escapes me, was enthusiastic-bordering-on-corny, but I'll take that over lazy and lackadaisical any day. He was on top of everything and very eager to field questions about the food. No complaints here.\n\nThe restaurant is less than a mile from my parents' house, and so it seems criminal to not pay Roma Garden a visit the next time I'm in Phoenix. It's not cheap, but the huge portions and even bigger flavors have me won. Definitely my current favorite Italian restaurant.
2 ||| Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fake/display cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it!
0 ||| Had not been to Chevy's in quite awhile and was very disappointed on this visit.  When my family entered we were told that there was a 20 minute wait but a full third of the tables were empty.  When questioned the hostess told us that she could seat us but nobody would be available to wait on us for at least 20 minutes.  After we were seated we were disappointed by the reduced menu.  Our server did not get our order right and everything took an incredibly long time even though the restaurant was not very busy.  Will not waste our time waiting again.
3 ||| Cute little restaurant, very cramped, but I feel like that is how it should be.  On a hot day, I almost feel like I am in Cuba.  They have a diverse menu, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  This doesn't seem like the ideal place to have a dinner date, but so far I have only had hits with this place.  Everyone I've taken here has loved that food and commented on how cute the restaurant is.  Mmmm...thinking about croquettes is making me crave some Havana Cafe.
1 ||| dear lulu, \n\nwhat's happened to you? you used to be *the* refuge for my asian food fix but your food leaves something to be desired lately.  dr fu's noodles has way too much salt; noodle bowls are only ok (you're a noodle place, after all - no excuses for being less than stellar), the bibimbop looks like a medley of canned products and tastes like it.\n\ni really *want* to like you...you do have a great menu selection, terrific drinks, very cool vibe, great location and efficient waitstaff but something in the kitchen really needs to change, please, please?\n\ni hate to say but...it's not me, it's you.
3 ||| I frequent here for lunch.  I adore their Pita's.  They make it really tasty and consistent every time.  Their menu is typical Greek, humus dip, lamb/pork skewer with rice, gyro's with side of crispy fries.\n\nA thing to know is you line up and order your food at the register and you obtain a number and just find an open seat.\n\nYou can't go wrong at all! Guaranteed to hit the spot!
3 ||| A zoo on the way up for some family fun\n\nWWZ has a good variety of animals and attractions.  The aquarium portion is especially fun for the younglings.  Interactive sessions are enjoyable, as well.  Their location in the West Valley primes them as an attraction as the area continues to grow.\n\nDrawbacks: The high price of admission-- one would think they could get some better sponsorships-- makes an outing relatively expensive.  Maintenance needs in areas and the small size of enclosures catch your attention.  And the snack shop, the one water park ride, and the gift shop come across as old/cheap.\n\nStill fun for the kids and it seems like the WWZ is investing so that they are on their way up.
3 ||| Spent an amazing afternoon at the Phoenix zoo.   The weather was perfect and it wasn't overly crowded.   The animals musta missed the memo announcing our arrival as most were sleeping but they were at least sleeping out where you could see them.  \n\nExtras are a bit pricey but overall it was a great way to spend the afternoon outside, enjoying the wonderful fall weather.
3 ||| Excellent service but pricey on tires.\n\nGood, clean waiting room with an abundance of magazines and bottled water if you need it.  DT actually will fix most tire punctures for free just hoping you give them your business next time you need tires.\n\nI tried doing that but I found that their prices are not only high, but they seem to persuade you into a tire they have in stock rather than one you may have thoroughly researched on the Net that you felt was in your price range, got good reviews and was right for your driving needs.\n\nI actually traded in my vehicle hours after going to DT and getting a $800+ price quote on tires. The difference I paid for the one-year newer vehicle was close to what the tires and the needed alignment would have cost.\n\nNothing I would recommend or that I would would typically do, but $800+ is like a major engine repair. \n\nDT has helped me through some jams in the past and I plan on returning. Service is good and they work quickly and efficiently. \nThere are better deals on tires elsewhere though, even online.
0 ||| I had heard great things about this gun shop from my dad, so while in the area, I thought I should check it out myself (and my boyfriend needed to get some boy-shopping time in).\n\nWe headed in and were casually walking through.  Many salesman stopped to ask us if we needed.  One asked if what were looking for, we replied that we were just looking.  Then somehow the conversation got to a place where the man was saying that I needed a gun for protection.... Um, no I don't.  I live in Dilworth.  That really turned me off.  Don't target women and tell them they need to buy guns to protect themself.  I've been to quite a few gun stores and this is the first one that did that...\n\nMy boyfriend seemed impressed with the amount of guns & gun related items.  I was impressed with the sheer amount of people in the store and the number of employees who asked if we needed anything.
2 ||| As far as Paneras go, this one is a-okay. As with most restaurants it can be hit or miss depending on the day, time and employees when you are there. I find that in the evenings, the \"C-crew\" is usually on duty. That means SLOW service, small portions, and an unwillingness to make the customer happy. On several occasions when I've dined here after 6 pm I've been told that they were \"out\" of different soups, whole grain bread, etc. with no offer to fix something else. Call me crazy but I think a restaurant with \"Bread\" in its name ought to have whole grain and plain baguettes, which come as standard sides with every meal, cooking up fresh. If the kitchen is out, then they need to bake more! What the heck? \n\nAt lunch time the \"A-crew\" is usually working so you get better food and service. This place gets insanely crowded during the lunch rush so get there early if you want a seat and you want to avoid lines. The staff tries hard to keep the tables clean but there are always some jackass businessmen who get there at 9 am, order coffee, and then sit and hog boots or tables made for 4 people all day long. So rude. \n\nThe interior could use a little TLC and renovation; the place is usually pretty clean but the furnishings are falling apart (note the photo I took of one of their chairs with a huge hole it in fixed with tape). \n\nThe salads here are really good and they use good ingredients. I do agree that the portion sizes can be very small, especially if you don't eat bread or carbs. I usually have the cobb salad here since I'm a low-carber. Check out my photo of the salad they actually served me recently -- the chicken portion on top was SO SKIMPY, even by Panera's standards. \n\nThis location has a good selection of fountain sodas (Pepsi brand) and they even have caffeine free Diet Pepsi. Their fresh brewed ice tea is great.
1 ||| Yelp is about being 100% Honest, All the Time right... Well here it goes. \n\nWas in dreaded Mesa & had to run in to this Home Depot... Not my first choice. Ive been to Home Depots across the valley and certain Home Depots I feel comfortable walking the whole store by myself... but not this one. I don't know what it is, Who knows. All I know is that we went in looking for something and came out empty handed, HOW does that happen at Home Depot? Went to Gilbert and found it at Ace Hardware. \n\nI wish I could tell you what the issue is with this Home Depot, Maybe its just me. Who knows... I'll shop Home Depot in Gilbert.
1 ||| Never going back!!\n\nThis was my second time here. Wasn't that impressed the first time, but thought I'll give it another look, more because one of the guys in our team really wanted to go here. \n\nFood: Just ok, over-priced and very small portions. Came out hungry. Deserts are quite nice\nService: I think I would have given this place 2 1/2 stars was it not for the bad service. Very rude waiter, I am not going to go into details of what happenned at our table but suffice to say I left the place pissed! Never going back and nor is the guy in our team who really wanted to go in the first place.\n\nI think I hate a rude (and I mean rude not bad) service more that bad food. Bad food just leaves me with no feelings but a rude server leaves me pissed!
0 ||| We made an appointment with one of their events people, Danny, to check out this place as a potential wedding venue. Saturday morning 9 a.m.\nWe showed up, he wasn't there. We waited 20 minutes. He never showed, never called. We waited a couple weeks, never heard from him or from anyone Doubletree. So ... that's pretty rude and disorganized. Blah.
0 ||| Dont waist your time!  We got here at 6:30 on sat night for a friends birthday. When we sat down we ordered a beer each and everyone wanted to do a shot so we all did one. We at that point we ordered chips and queso dip. 45 min later we ask about the queso and the waitress said she will check on it. She comes back out the kitchen and says they are making it now. WTF this is chips from a bag and some cheese dip the put in a microwave. Unreal. 10 min later our chips and queso show up. Everytime we ordered a beer it took 15-20 min to get. No joke. Its because they have one person bartending on a saturday night. Not sure why, but the place was only about a third full but she was backed up and the manager was not helping. At about 8:30 a few more people show up and we got another shot and now my third beer in two hours. When the waitress brings the drinks she tells us the manager says we cant order anymore drinks for 30 45 min. I said why not. She says the manager says we cant serve you anymore shots cause there is a limit to how much we can serve you in a certain amount of time. I said you have got to be kiddding me. On my third beer and two little girl foo foo shots and we are cut off, one hour for queso dip , you are f$#kin kidding me. I said check please we are out of here. We were not being loud or causing in attention to us for any reason. It was the most melow I have seen a grpup of 10 be at a bar. A few people went outside to smoke every once in a while and each end of the table had there own conversation going on.The worst service, I have never seen this before. I have been drinkin at the bars for a while and I have to say 3 12oz bottel beers and 2 shots in 2 and a half hours on a sat night is a slow start at the bar. This place is horrible. If I could give them 0 stars or negative stars I would! Im sorry I guess Im the only one going to the bar on a sat night to get a littel drunk.
1 ||| At first glance, this is a great community. The dog parks and pools are the best part of this place. And thats where the greatness ends.\n\nTHE STAFF IS HORRIBLE!!!!! They do not return phone calls, and basically have their heads up their butts, because there is no communication between the corporate office and all their residences...\n\nI heard good things about Mark Taylor Residences,which is why we looked at this place, but after living with them for over a year, \nI WILL NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND LIVING HERE. \nThey overcharge for rent, and dont tell you when your rent is being raised. They also require a 60 day to-vacate notice, not a 30 day, and they dont tell you that either. READ THE FINE PRINT. Otherwise, you will get screwed. Oh, and make sure that you look at an apartment that you would actually be getting, because they show you the better one of the two. We got all old appliances and old carpet, but they showed us a nicer place, saying it was the same rent. When we went to move in, they said \"oh you have to pay more for that one you looked at.\" Freaking idiots. Come to find out, our neighbor paid the same rent and had all those new things that we were excited about in the beginning. When we brought it up to a manager, we didn't receive a call back. Figures...\n\nEven after moving out, we are still getting screwed. We had our address changed with the office, and even after going to the office a second time to make sure it was changed, they still didn't do it. My fiance's mail for the last month and a half has been being sent back to the post office, bills included. \n\nSO THANK YOU VERY LITTLE MARK TAYLOR RESIDENCES, FOR SCREWING OVER YOUR RESIDENTS! \n\nDO NOT MOVE IN HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0 ||| Used to be great. .. my go to spot. .. not so much anymore. .. I don't know what they did,  but the food tastes,, medicinal now.  Seriously,  what happened? !. I keep thinking \"it will be back to it's old self\" again..but no.  I gave them three chances, and its still not good.  I won't be back until I see some reviews that reflect a change for the better. ...
2 ||| My girlfriend and I ate at one of these restaurants in California for dinner and it was great so we stopped in this one for breakfast expecting the same.  The food was okay, but very small portions and the toast could have passed for croutons.  The prices were high for what we got.  Service was okay, but I will pass next time and find another place for breakfast.
4 ||| Best croissants outside of France, no exaggeration.  Wonderful muffins (peach are my favorite but I'm told the pistachio are divine) and the focaccio is superb, but only if you get there early enough before they sell out.  All their bread is made by hand on the premises and they really know what they're doing.
4 ||| There are worse airports to be stuck in for 8 hours with a 102 degree fever and frequent bouts of  atomic diarrhea intermingled with seemingly eternal sessions of projectile vomiting (and this is only one quarter of the way through my travel itinerary) after a night of mostly the same and a day of trying to navigate the American Aviation system in the middle of the holiday rush. Perhaps some of you recall my last cross-country travel experience (3 days stuck at SFO waiting for a flight out...). This time was not much better. \n\nBut the airport staff at Phoenix made my excruciating delay that much better by providing me with tissues, sprite (for my tummy), tons of pillows, and enough blankets to warm my shivering, shaking, feverish body. Had I not convinced them I had food poisoning, they probably wouldn't have allowed me on the flight that I finally got on at 2 a.m. after boarding my first flight at 2 p.m. the day before and facing an additional 4 hour flight. Their assistance and support helped me get some much-needed sleep while awaiting my winged chariot and made the flight I finally got on much easier than my former flight had been.\n\nI might add that there were ample food and sundries stations in the terminal I was in and I easily found all the medication I cared to take and regurgitate. I have been in and out of this particular airport for various reasons over the years and always found it rather average until this past week. Thank you, Southwest employees and airport personnel for making yet another miserable travel experience so much easier to endure.
4 ||| Love this place!!! They burst my sushi cherry and I've been addicted ever since! The screaming orgasm is amazing and the green tea tempura ice cream is great!!!
3 ||| this has been one the places i crave for in the two years that i have spent in Glendale...\nI love the chicken schwarma.... although i agree with Nadia on the fact that it does get a little drippy over the end. \nbut overall really good food, quick service, and not expensive... \nfor that cost, its healthy food that fills you up...\nGo for Greek Wraps, and trust me you wont regret it....
2 ||| Marginal at best, if you think this place is great you have never lived in the Midwest. I went there for Summer Sausage ad it was a disgrace. No natural casing, I could have went to the mall or Frys and got me some you my Hillshire Farms. Horrible Summer Sausage.\n\nThe Liverwurst was another disgrace to all that is liver.\n\nSorry guys, you really let this Southern Illinois boy down.  \n\nAnd to the people that think this place is great, I am truly sorry for your taste buds.
3 ||| I wish more people went to Papa J's. It has great food, a truly unique atmosphere, and Frank. Frank the bartender is one cool guy. I'll get to him later.\n\nFirst, the ambiance. Very old building, low lighting, dark wood... a bit \"dodgy,\" really.\n\nIt could be that the headboard of Madame Dolly Cavanaugh hangs above the bar. Yes, Papa J's used to be brothel in Pittsburgh's industrial heyday. But that's not all the whimsy the restaurant has to offer. Clutch the pearls and phone Rick Sebak, because it's also rumored to be haunted! Frankly, this doesn't surprise me. If you poke around a bit you half expect the members of Mystery Inc. to be disappearing behind false walls. Jinkies.\n\nThe food is good, comforting, and plentiful. The wedding soup is tasty and perfect for taking the chill off you in the winter.  All entrees come with fresh italian bread with dippings and range from $10-$20. You can choose from several pastas with a variety of sauces and meats. Try the veal bolognese pasta, served with tomato cream sauce. Delicious! They regularly have several daily specials, one of which is usually seafood. \n\nNow to Frank. He's a friendly older gentleman with lots of stories to tell. Usually, I drink beer or wine.  But when I'm at Papa J's, I simply let Frank pick my drink. Just tell him what you're in the mood for; something dry, fruity, bitter, or strong... and he will whip up something tasty.  \n\nI highly recommend Papa J's. Go there on one of those nights when you want to go out to eat, but can't quite figure out where to go. You're tired of chains, not in the mood for bar food, and don't want to spend a lot of money. Head to Papa J's Centro. Frank will fix you up!
0 ||| I called to make an appointment and asked specifically if they were \"in network\" providers for my insurance.  The appointment clerk assured me they were and I made my appointment.  The office and the Doctor were both nice.  I received good service.  I was shocked to also receive a bill!  My insurance did not cover my annual visit.  I called my insurance company (Tricare) only to find out that the specific office I went to was not in network.  Tricare suggested I call the Dr. office back and have them recode this visit under another Dr.  I called and let them know the issue.  The rep in the billing department told me she would have to speak with the office manager, this was not the first time they had experienced this issue, and call me back.  When she called me back, she said the only thing she could do is apply the already advertised $20 discount to my $95 bill.  Basically, I am stuck paying for my appointment that should be covered by my insurance due to a mistake and lack of training on the staff's part.  Beware!!  I bought an entire year of contacts as well and told her I would not be making any further appointments with them.
3 ||| This store has Coke Zero in their fountain offerings!
3 ||| This is the only acceptable pizza I've eaten in Pittsburgh. Having tried 11 other pizza places in delivery range of Oakland, there is no contest. When I feel nostalgic for a NY slice IVP is the only viable solution.
4 ||| I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service, Quality, Taste, and portion size of the food and drinks, and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant.....\n\nThis is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw \"Brave\" Great Movie) \n\nAnyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy.... \n\nThe waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip) \n\nSo on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color..... \n\nNow my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal....\n\nLast but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about..... \n\nOverall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing.....
2 ||| *Meh* If it were not for the amazingly hot date I was with, I would have rated this place lower.\n\nMy recent quickie trip to the Burgh meant that I intended that no matter what, I was going to see the Monongahela Incline, no matter what, and have to cram into that view a meal.\n\nWe took a rather fun (And cheap) ride up the incline, then in walking up and down the touristy, overpriced \"view\" restaurants on the upside, we settled on Isabela.  It was a bit later than usual PA dining hours, 8:30pm on a Wednesday night.  The place was pretty dead, only 1 other table.\n\n+ 1 Star - Menu.  They have an outrageously priced multi-course prix fixe meal, but they also have some alla carte items.  Well thank heavens for that.\n- 1 Star - Service.  Nice maitre'd (or maybe he was the manager...) who greeted us downstairs (a little shocked at first that we just strolled in off the street, but he covered his surprise well and made us feel welcome). The table side staff was weak.  Waitress forgot, in this order: water, bread, butter, our 1 side dish we ordered, 2nd glass of wine we ordered.  And there was only 1 other table of 4 people in addition to ours.  Additionally, though I understand that the place was rather shutting down toward the end of our meal (we left by 10pm), it is still not okay to not check on us and for us to have to put lots of effort into waving you down.  There is a reason you are paid as a SERVER.  To SERVE.\n- 1 Star - Quality.  I just was not impressed.  My salad was tiny - just ridiculously small, and the lettuce had some grit to it.  Wash my dang lettuce, folks.  The ravioli started (just ONE ravioli? Are you serious?) was homemade, granted, but the dough was thick around the filling, making it more like a pierogi and not a very good one at that.  Dessert was not memorable.  My espresso was cold.  Come on! Geez!\n- 1 Star - Price.  I know, paying for the view.  But it was just too expensive and too mediocre to warrant the price.\n+1 Star - View.  I kept looking out the window and longing to have that view forever.  Just gorgeous.  Definitely a night time spot, on a clear night preferably.\n\nAll in all, a place to go to once, maybe, for a romantic meal.  But just once.  Next time I think a picnic at the top of the incline would be better food though.
1 ||| (-) A \"large\" bowl of pho looks like a regular bowl of pho to me\n(-) Pricey for the amount you get\n(-) It was an almost-satisfying amount of pho in the large bowl. I'm going to be looking for food in an hour or two\n(-) The Che 3 Mau dessert I got had green jelly that was still slightly frozen -___-\n\nThis place is meh. Nothing too spectacular.
2 ||| One would think that there are only casinos on the Las Vegas Strip or Old Downtown Las Vegas. Guess again!!!!\n\nThere are several casinos outside these areas, but they aren't as \"spectacular\" in the typical \"LV scene\" as one might think. So all in all - not much to expect from here other than the gambling.\n\nWhat has gotten worse about the casino is that it has gotten a bit \"cheese-y\" with the decor. It has no theme. In addition, the ventilation has gotten worse and you know how you walk into a Korean BBQ and smell like that after you've eaten there? Well once you walk through this casino for a good 5-10 minutes, your clothes will possibly smell like you've smoked a pack. Just sayin'.....................\n\n**CONFESSION**\nI'm not much of a gambler. I'm even scared of loosing $1 on a slot machine! I always feel that if I'm going to spend $, I should benefit in some type of rewards wether it is in a form of retail therapy or indulging in meals. So I cannot attest to the casino level of Sunset Station nor the Hotel since I didn't stay here either. But I would imagine it would be a lot cheaper since you're not staying on the strip. You'd just pay for the commute. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSo why am I writing a review about this place if I didn't spend the night here nor contribute any losses on the slot machines?\n\nIt's because if I'm in the area (Henderson) and visiting my grandmother, we would watch movies at their Regal Theaters. I can remember watching movies here since I was in elementary school. Yes the place is a bit dim, carpet sucks, bathroom needs an upgrade, but for some things that they have improved upon are the seats in the theaters and the screens. \n\nOverall, you won't get the razzle-dazzle-ness from the typical casino, but you can watch a movie here in peace and serenity. Just be cautious you'll smell like cigarettes after you've watched a movie........
3 ||| This place is an excellent shopping alternative to the malls in Charlotte.  It's not, however, a place to go to \"picking\" the prices are essentially the antique version of retail.\n\nBut the selection is excellent, you can find a little bit of everything.  Don't go if you are in a hurry, you will need at least two hours to look around and get a grasp of it all.\n\nIf you are looking for something particular just ask anyone at the front desk, they are all very helpful and friendly.  There is a consignment shop which focuses more on clothing attached to the Sleepy Poet which also has a lot of stuff to sort through.\n\nOh, and free popcorn!
1 ||| Went during their anniversary celebration.  The building definitely has some character.  But I also felt overwhelmed as if it was a labyrinth of Italian food - but I also understand its been their for a good amount of time so that has no bearing on the star rating.  Anyways. Service was really lacking here.  Ordered a beer when we sat down and didn't get it until after the appetizer.  Got the artichoke dip.  It was good but the value for what we paid wasn't worth it. Free bread was good. Nice and warm and tasty.  Entrees came and were good too.  Pasta cooked well.  Got the brown butter with cheese, very tasty. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well.  When server brought entrees said shed be back to refill water glasses, that didn't happen until desserts came......., so why even come? Not only that but our cheese dispenser was empty when we sat down, was told by runner that he would bring a new one, waited for 5 min, then I just got up and took it from another table. \n\nNot sure if it was just bc of the specials they were running and thus slowing down service but I would go back bc of the price point of the food. But if the service was the same I'd probably not come.
3 ||| The Penguin is a great place for a bite to eat, but make sure you have time to enjoy it - because you might have to wait on a table.  If your party is small, the bar is a good place to eat too.  Check out the sweet potato fries and the black bean burger, you can't get anything like them anywhere else in Charlotte.
3 ||| First to respond to some of the other reviews and folks who reviewed on other sites regarding the locale.  Yes, it is in a strip mall.  Not a fancy strip mall but we didn't have any plans on eating in the parking lot.  I'm not sure why the issue of safety is raised as we didn't feel there were any safety concerns.  Inside is very clean and the atmosphere is casual.  Enough said about that.\n\nWe felt from the menu offerings that there is a great west coast (of Mexico) influence.  There are many seafood options and also the offering of spanish rice contributed to our feeling of the \"west\".\n\nIn terms of the salsa.  The green salsa is sweet but they bring that along side a red salsa that has a nice little kick to it.  Alternating between the two was surprisingly grand.  They so nicely complimented each other.\n\nThe first time I try a new Mexican restaurant I always have the mole.  I figure if they do a good job on this complex sauce then they do a good job on everything.  I had the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and it was great.  We didn't see just chicken mole on the menu, only this dish, but our waiter said no problem.  Great to know when we return.  My partner had a shrimp burrito with a pineapple salsa.  The burrito was filled with alot of good meaty shrimp and the taste was extremely good.  \n\nPrices are reasonable and the service was very courteous and efficient.  What more can I ask for?  We will be back.  As a side note, the menu on their website is quite abbreviated and I believe it does a disservice to the restaurant.  The actual menu is varied and offers many choices.
2 ||| I wish i could rate it 3.5... There are certain foods that are mediocre, but certain foods that I loved! The steak burger was amazing  (is it delmonico?).  And definetly get tater tots instead of fries. Fish tacos are delicious as well. Also they have great frozen cosmo and amazing bloody mary!\n\nI personally did not like the waiters as they are a bit pushy with trying to get you to order more drinks/food. Their selection of beer seems pretty cool, but I have never once tried any of their beer and liked it, also they seemed a bit on the warmer side. Also their dips (like the babaganoush) are awful... seems like they have a big bucket of it, then slap some of it on a place, reheat for 30 seconds, and serve.
3 ||| Steak was good. Chicken was chewy. Service was great. Price not bad. I've had much better for the price.
3 ||| I love HOG, I can't say that enough. \nSure, it looks kind of crummy from the outside, but don't be deceived, it is a great hidden diamond of goodness. Easily best Chinese on campus (yes, even over cravings).\nGo there for the lunch and dinner specials, you get two entrees over rice or noodles for 5.50. It's only 50 cents to add on another entree. Listen, they don't mess around with the portions. They give you A LOT of food, for so little!  And it's damn good food too. Everything I've gotten here I've liked. The dishes are all put together well. \nIf you're a scared baby get the orange chicken or kung-pao whatever dish they have during the lunch/dinner special. When you want something more go for the spare ribs, green beans, and pork meatballs. You can't go wrong here.
3 ||| In town on business and I always try to find places like this.  Wow, a martini bar not named the Blue Martini?  OK, I'm in!\n\nSo I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!\n\nSo I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \"deer in the headlights look\", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \"here's your sign\"!\n\nSo OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.\n\nA few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \"some\" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  \n\nIt seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.  I will return to try a martini, but I will pass on the food.
1 ||| Lo-Lo's is a No-No! \n\nI read all these great reviews, my mouth was watering and saved my appetite.  I was REALLY disappointed.  We arrived there at 12:00pm on a Tuesday afternoon.\n\nItems we ordered\n\n*2 chicken wings w/waffle\n*2 drumsticks w/red beans and rice\n*fried okra\n*greens\n*red velvet cake\n*1/2 tea and 1/2 sweet tea\n\nOh the chicken.....................not crispy and NO flavor!!  Like another reviewer said, \"my mom makes better fried chicken\"  - I couldn't agree with her more!  I was thinking about Popeye's chicken while eating this one.  Missing the crispiness and flavors.\n\nThe waffle was very good.  Had a hint of cinnamon.\n\nRed beans and rice tasted like it someone opened a can of baked or chili beans and poured it over rice.  Popeye has won over this one too.\n\nThank goodness for the greens!!  They were tender and DELISH!!!!  But is it worth driving there to get greens.... i dunno...\n\nThe coating on the fried okra was hard.\n\nOh Noooo..... the red velvet cake was the WORST!!!  If there is Red Velvet cake at an establishment, I'll always try it.  I was sooooo disappointed with this one. I only took two bites and had to push it away.  It was too dense and it tasted like there was tons of oil in it.  The cake didn't have flavor, just red.  The frosting was waaay too sweet.  Try Tammie Coe's instead.   \n\nI grew up on Southern food and this place was not tasty at all. \n\nThe service was friendly, but slow.\n\nOne star is for the greens \nOne star for the waffle
0 ||| This place is a standard salad bar, similar to Sweet Tomatoes if you can compare it to that. I ate here one evening because at the time there were no Sweet Tomatoes in Mesa or Gilbert and I was really needing my salad fix!\n\nFirst thing I noticed was how filthy the salad bar was. It was seriously a mess...goopy salad dressing smeared all over, lettuce everywhere, vegetables that looked like they hadn't been wiped off the counter for hours. It was just gross to see that type of a mess in a buffet line. \n\nThe place was packed for a weeknight so I figured it was going to taste pretty good, or as good as salad buffet can be. The selection was mediocre at best, without too many options for salad toppings, and worst of all- the lettuce had seen its share of better days. It was wilted and browned. Plus if I remember correctly, there was an overabundance of iceberg lettuce and virtually no romaine and no spinach. \n\nThe soup was equally as disappointing. One of the soups was so salty it almost seemed like it was a mistake, like they accidentally doubled the sodium in the recipe. Ugh. I tried the other soups thinking they'd be better but all of them tasted like they came from a mix, or something out of a can. There was no distinct flavor to anything. I left thinking, is this it? Even so, I returned a second time to see if maybe it was just an off-day, plus I needed another salad fix. Well, same story, different day- dirty restaurant, and questionable food.
0 ||| Old working man's bar. People are nice for the most part- bartenders are less skanky (some even nice) than the bars in the neighborhood with the same owner. \n\nNothing special about the place- just a neighborhood dive. Sometimes there are a lot of bikers- the neighborhood is going to hell. Shoot out just the other day- saw a man blocking traffic on Peoria right in front of the place, beating his passenger. The liquor store next door calls black people \"animals\". I could live the rest of my life happily without ever returning- yet, this is my hood, so whatevs- you know I'm coming back... ... ... ...\n\nand he said, \"Baby, anywhere you want... you want the Four Seasons?\" and she said, \" Four Seasons?... ~Skink-hock-ptui~ Nah, I wanna go to the 5030!\".\n\nTrue Story.
3 ||| Tons of shoes for women, some for men, zilch for kids.  Huge clearance section, but not all deals are really that great.  Good place to go if you're pretty self-serve and have a general idea of what shoes cost elsewhere.  Their rewards program is pretty generous- $10 back for every couple hundred you spend- not a hard limit to meet.
3 ||| Gotta agree with Ebony. I can' t go in here without finding a bunch of stuff at great prices. I go in for one thing and come out with some fantastic deals. They have kind of replaced Mervyn's for me.
0 ||| If you've ever said to yourself \"Hey I want to eat lunch in a dirty bus station in the south this place is for you!\"\n\nConsistently the dirtiest restaurant in the city and I my visits are years apart.  The food is typical burger king fare but definately get a to go bag.
4 ||| Short and Sweet.  \n\nLove Love LOVE this hospital.  I've had surgery there and now my brother is getting care at Good Sam (been in 1 week so far).  The nurses on his floor are for the most part, awesome.  \n\nPros - Valet Parking, Cafeteria on LL2 open 24/7 (grill and yogurt section closes at 7:30ish though), and all the staff at Good Sam.  \nCons - Regular Parking.
0 ||| They told me they could fix my car, but when they were done, they found more wrong with it.  A fifth grader could have done better.
2 ||| How this place has managed to stay open so long is an eternal mystery to me!  The food has always been mediocre.  The service was not even that good.  But somehow it endures.  Guess that explains how Dubya got reelected!
3 ||| I'm not familiar with Tj Maxx... but it's like a Marshall's! They have some pretty high end stuff too, like Lucky Jeans and Juicy sunglasses. Anyway, I picked up a really cute Michael Kors tank and a cashmere sweater! If you're willing to take the time to sift through the stuff here, I'm sure you'd find lots of awesome things. It's sort of like a treasure hunt where you are always guaranteed something good! And what's awesome is there seems to be a larger selection for the smaller sizes. . .which is obviously good for me :P
2 ||| TGI Friday's is not the most exciting place to go to, but it had the right price for us and we shared 2 plates that filled us up.\n\nI ordered a shrimp and chicken alfredo pasta and shared it with my boyfriend who ordered a sampler plate. They both tasted good. We also had a blue raspberry iced drink that was still syrupy even after we mixed it.\n\nThe environment isn't very appealing, and for some reason I felt like our waiter didn't really want to serve us, or wasn't paying attention to us when we spoke to him.\n\nOh well, not a memorable experience.
0 ||| This place used to be really good. They made the best tacos (which they don't make anymore) and green chili. The green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners. They have raised their prices which is completely unjustified due to the quality going down. This place has now become nothing more than an eye sore and nuisance to the local neighborhood. Close your doors and move on.
3 ||| Come here to fill yourself up with veggies, simple pastas, soups and some soft serve ice cream.  Each location is the same and you can have your food exactly the way you want!
3 ||| I've eaten here twice now, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food here is just okay, in my opinion.  It is good for when I'm in a crunch and craving Mexican food and need a quick, convenient spot to chow down at.  However, there are definitely way better Mexican dining options out there.  I had the chorizo, egg, and papa breakfast burrito most recently when I visited here.  It is huge!  Definitely big enough to split between two people, and good portion size for the price.
4 ||| Went to Blue Adobe on Tuesday.  The Owners greeted us and remembered us from our previous visit.  Tuesday is Taco Night and a Taco Plate is only $6.99.  I ordered the taco plate and a margarita. My wife and son split the pulled pork salad.  Both meals were excellent.  The service was also impeccable. I would highly recommend the Blue Adobe.
4 ||| Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. High quality service and creative dishes. Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount.  \n\nMust try:\nCalamari\nCheese plate\nShort Rib Ravioli\nPork Chop\nWatermelon Gin Fizz
0 ||| Wish I was able to give  1/2 of a Star! \n\nI don't know why the Yelper in me failed to check  out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot.  However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back  \"No Probably\" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!   \n\n                                  Eight Items on the Buffet \n\nFried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork\n\n\nAs I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: \"How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right\"?  If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of  small,dried out,  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful. \n\nSo there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!
0 ||| This could be the worst Whole Foods in the Valley. The cold case is way smaller than most other places and they don't have all the usual salads available, including the one I came looking for which was the Tailgate coleslaw. No BBQ area, no pre-cooked meals to go or salads to go either. The smoothie place on site uses frozen fruit, not fresh fruit as well. I have come across these versions of Whole foods before and not sure why they don't renovate the older stores or move to larger location. Every one should be the same with the same choices. Will find another.
3 ||| Sometimes a girl gets a wicked hankerin' for some chicken fried steak, mashed taters, and white gravy.  You know that what she does?  She goes to Texaz Grill.\n\nFor a ridiculously satisfying and heart clogging meal, you can't beat it.  It's got a casual and fun atmosphere, and it's extremely reasonably priced.  And best of all, the bar has a total honky tonk feel that makes me want to run home and play Urban Cowboy with the mister.
3 ||| Unable to get in to the restaurant we wanted, discovered Luna by chance. Although it was busy, the host found us two seats at the bar, and we had a wonderful time. Although the bartender was new, and had to ask the host about our questions on the menu items, the service was lovely, ambiance very warm and inviting and the food superb! Every item we ordered was a symphony to our palettes. The owner/chef, Raquel Aikman, came out to inquire how we enjoyed it, and we had a lovely chat. Will be back!!
2 ||| We just saw Marmalade Skies play here last night.  We showed up early to grab one of the last tables. Fans of the band showed up in full-force. It was SRO early in their set. They sounded great ! \n\nThe service, however, was below par. It seemed as if the place wasn't  prepared for the crowd that the band would bring in, even though the band played there about a month ago! We ended up waiting for the server to check on us more than once while we sat with water & drinks completely drained. If we hadn't been there specifically for the band, it's very likely we would have gone some where else. \n\nNo condiments brought out for the sliders. No small plates brought out with the nachos deluxe which were nothing special. The sides of ranch we ordered didn't arrive either. The fries that came with the Real Deal Philly Rib Eye were soggy. Their Wings are the reason for 3 stars. I had the Honey Hot  wings grilled and they were DELICIOUS!
0 ||| I'm such a fan of Starbucks and this is the one closest to my house. It's terrible. The wait times are extra long, at least 10 minutes and often 20 or more in the  mornings. I would also estimate 1 out of every 5 of my drinks have been wrong, usually adding sweetener to an unsweetened order. I hate to admit, I still go frequently but not if I'm leaving the neighborhood and have another store to choose on my way. \nDouble check your drinks and budget plenty of time into your stop and you should be ok. If not, it's a very frustrating location, save your time.
3 ||| Interesting place in the middle of the desert between AZ and CA.
3 ||| Extremely busy restaurant. They move you quickly so dont let that deter you. The food is very good. Great price point and large portions. This is not a fancy place but the service is great and the wait staff very friendly.
2 ||| I was disappointed.  I havd very high hopes based on other reviews, but The Fry Bread House was just OK.  I tried the green chili soup (very, very good), the ultimate chorizo taco (eh.....) and the chocolate and buter (one bite was enough).  Overall a cute, aka authentic, place with nice enough service, but no need to waste a meal there if you are from out of town.
4 ||| Andrea's friday night class is awesome. I am a fighter and i enjoy the stretch and push i get from her class. A great release with even better results!
3 ||| Went back for CES, and I dont know if i over ate or there was some extra MSG, but i got an immediate stomach ache after the meal. The food tasted excellent however.. so im sticking with 4 stars and a warning to pace yourself, yelpers!
2 ||| Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\n\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \n\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.
2 ||| Dear Yelp,\n\nThis Sheraton is stuck in 1998.  The staff is very friendly, but the place itself has not kept pace with the progress of the Sheraton brand.  I suppose I can't knock the Southwest decor - after all, it's in Phoenix - but this place just doesn't scream \"classy-modern\".  The kids may be happy, and the 55+ crowd may be happy, but the 25-40s aren't likely to be pleased.\n\nAnd Yelp ... if you ever speak to management ... please tell them that the elevators scare innards out of me.  It's seriously time to ensure that they stop where they are told to and that each floor has a button, rather than a hole for the a button that once was.\n\nLove,\nRob
3 ||| Chaparral Suites have big rooms that work great for a family of four. We stayed in a double queen and the pull out couch in the living area was nice for the kids to have separated beds. The rooms are on the older side but the entire hotel has lots of character. There is plenty poolside space to lay about.\nWe also enjoyed the cooked breakfast in the morning and the complimentary drinks in the evening. Looking forward to returning soon.
0 ||| I didn't know there were any car washes not using filtered water left in Phoenix, but apparently Full Circle's one of them. While even coin-op washes boast \"spot-free filtered water!\", I had to break out the quick detailer spray and a microfiber as soon as I got home from Full Circle--water spots galore!\n\nThis was after the attendant had done my towel dry, mind you, and wiped down most of the water but left my mirrors soapy. And picked the remnants of the receipt out of my windshield cowl, because the other attendant helpfully left it tucked under the wiper blade when he sent me through.\n\nSure, for 4 bucks I didn't have to get sweaty in the humid summer air (well, at least not until I came home and had to clean up their mess)... but  I don't think it's unreasonable to think \"Exterior Wash\" shouldn't be synonymous with \"Careless Wash.\"
2 ||| Wow. We have a Pho So 1 in Las Vegas Nevada. This is the first out of state Pho So 1 than the ones found in SoCal. \n\nUnfortunately, the majority of the Pho So 1 restaurants in SoCal still dominates on their taste in food than yours. Sorry. \n\nHere are my reason & suggestions for further improvements: \n1. Your restaurant is way too crowded. I think it's best to have one of those call for reservations. This will hopefully organize the restaurant. \n\n2. Disadvantage of crowded restaurant would impact the quality of the foods. Overcrowded customers can cause the crew to make the foods in a rush & food done in a rush of course would have poor quality tasting. I do recommend about having a larger crew than you currently have. \"Hire more soldiers\" to serve in your kitchen. \n\nI feel your foods is ok; the pho tasted like the Pho So 1 from SoCal. Though, I felt it was done in a rush, especially on crowded days. Therefore, I think if you have \"more troops\" to do the work, especially on crowded days, it would be doable. \n\nOverall, 3/5 stars from me. I might come back in the future. Follow those 2 suggestions above & I'll assure you that you'll improve Pho So 1 of Las Vegas. \n\n\n\nP.S. To the \"founder\" of Pho So 1 who's reading this: since you have successfully open 1 Pho So 1 restaurant outside of Southern California (i.e. Pho So 1 of Las Vegas), I do have further suggested locations of other additional locations you can open up Pho So 1: \n1. Reno Nevada\n2. San Francisco California\n3. Oakland California\n4. San Jose California\n5. Phoenix Arizona\n6. Honolulu Hawaii\n7. Hilo Hawaii
0 ||| My first 1-star review. Why include the word \"dumpling\" in the name when you have hardly any dumplings on the menu? .:. Came here for dim sum and was not happy. In retrospect, the pad thai on the dim sum menu should have warned me. The pork was incredibly dry, the shu mai tasted plastic, the red bean buns were pre-packaged/microwaved (recognized the wrapper), and I had to actually dip into the crispy noodles in order to satiate myself. Then I ate all the fortune cookies for our table. \n\nNo qualms with the fast service (hence the 1 star) but I'm afraid that's more due to lack of diners.
0 ||| They always take weeks to get things done & overcharged. I was ok with that when they did a good job. But then they stopped doing a good job. Not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job.
0 ||| No!\n\nI said - NO!!!
0 ||| This so-called mall is as ghetto as it can get. In the past 10 years I've witnessed the fast decline from decent to total dive. The place is swarming with derelicts and gang members...and their little harlots. Every time I try to go into a store, I get some burnt out derelict or crackhead demanding money from me. Or I encounter some high school dropout jail bait trying to flirt money out of me. Oh and not to mention all the dysfunctional families that allow their 10 year olds to run around using language that would make a factory worker blush.\n\n The only reasons this mall still exists is because of Walmart and Target. I have a feeling if either store were to leave Spectrum Mall the whole thing would collapse. My advice is not to go there unless you can afford a body guard or if you have a gun.
4 ||| This is where we take our two cats.  They are excellent.  Dr. Lisa is our attending Vet and all of the staff just love to see you and your animal children.\n\nFull service, surgery, recovery ward and whatever is needed to care for your pets.\n\nThey will be moving soon to a new location further down the road across from Lowe's.  Their current location can be easily missed as it is back from Hwy 521 and you can wiz by their driveway in an instant.\n\nWe do like this operation.
3 ||| First \"nice\" place I ever took my boyfriend and was not disappointed.  Quaint and modest, this little family-owned Italian restaurant on Capitol Square is absolutely phenomenal.  Beautiful fresh flowers and glowing candles decorate the tables, Frank Sinatra provides music to your ears, the bar offers a fabulous wine selection, and the view of the Capitol lit up at night provides a breathtaking view for your eyes.  Go on a Saturday from late Spring to early fall and enjoy  a menu that features the freshest food purchased from the local Farmer's Market that very morning.  Favorites include the Caprese salad, cannelloni, seafood pasta, and tiramisu.  This would also be a delightful place to have your rehearsal dinner or other special occasion.  If you're in town, be sure to visit! Mangia, mangia!
2 ||| I am trying to venture out of my shell and try different places for lunch at work these days.  Today I decided to come here, since its been a while since Ive eaten at this Deli.  From what I had remembered, it was good, so I hiked on down to try it out.\n\nWhen I entered, the Deli was pretty quiet. It must have been the \"Friday lite\" lunch crowd.  Lots of business people like myself eating here. I forgot how expensive this place is.  I saw that they had a BBQ Pastrami sandwich special going, so I went with that.  I got fries and a pickle, and I ordered a pop as well.  Guess how much I spent?  $9.25!!!  OMG!!!  TO MUCH TO MUCH!!!  \n\nGranted, I took home half a sandwich, but honestly, what a rip off!  The food wasnt even that good. Im not even excited to eat the leftovers when I get home.  this place isn't what I remember it to be, and just wasn't as good. I think its way overpriced, and the food is mediocre.  Save a few bucks and go somewhere else.
0 ||| Awful!  Just awful!  I thought this place was open to the public 24/7 but alas!  Yelp has failed to note this...drove all the way out for a romantic evening and it was crushed by lack of communication on when the \"hockey jocks\" ruled the rinks.
4 ||| I used to go to First Watch once a week and I strongly recommend this place.  The pancakes are to die for and the service is first rate.  It i one of the few breakfast places that keeps it real with the sausage, and serves it up many ways (links, patties, chorizo, etc).  One of my favorite places in the valley.
4 ||| South Mountain is the place for a hiker to visit when he/she doesn't want to deal with the headaches and the mass of humanity that are Camelback and Piestawa.  Granted, there are reasons for their popularity, and no, South Mountain isn't really on their level as far as personal challenge or scenic masterpieces go, but its a very solid alternative for a weekend hike when you know that the line of cars for parking is stretched a mile long in central/north Phoenix.\n\nMy gf and I usually hike the Alta trail, which is a progressively steep trail up to the peak, but still a manageable grade in slope that you will never have to use your hands to ascend or descend.  It takes about an hour and 15 mins to go up and down the mountain, and the view of SoPho, Downtown, Glendale, and Tempe are killer.  Its a great place to snap a few pics of the enormous city below.  \n\nTypically, we will run into one or two hikers maximum on this hike, which pretty cool for some solitary reflection.  Lately, I've taken up bringing my iPod along, as there is nothing quite like descending the valley into the park amongst massive mountains with Band of Horses or The National narrating your steps musically.  Breath taking.
3 ||| This place was discovered purely by accident.  I wanted some noodle dish and i was near my old high school I googled good noodle places on my phone...this place.came up...i was like why not just try it for take out...i pulled up and i walked in and looked at the menu...i was so confused...tbey have italian and asian choices...i was like great this place cannot be too good if they are offering two types of food...but i was there already so i was going to try it...i was conflicted i love italian but i wanted asian so i got a staple...pad thai...it was delicious...full of flavor and i was very impressed! Since then i have been back and this place is good...i go here if i am in the area...its super casual...i love to take the food home and eat if while watching my reality tv and desperate housewives show...good place you should try it!
0 ||| The bartender was very rude. I asked him to fix a drink that was bad and he told he wouldn't fix it that I should just get something else. The server wasn't really sure what was on happy hour. No manager was alerted about my disservice.
2 ||| .The chicken is good and for the most part everything else is good but something is wrong with the coleslaw there. At one point, ever time I would eat there, I'd get stomach cramps soon after. Once I thought it was because of the side of beans I ate but then the next time I ate there, I didn't order the beans yet still had the same problem. Then I'd notice that when I ate leftovers, I only had the chicken and didn't have any problems and figured that the only common thread was the coleslaw and that seemed to be the problem. I haven't had their coleslaw ever since and haven't had any problems since.
3 ||| I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.\n\nTheir beer selection changes often, and I've never been disappointed.  If I don't know what the beer is, they'll often bring over a sample to try to make sure I like it.\n\nThe veggie dogs are great, the cheese fries are great, and I've never had a problem with the service.   It can get crowded when a game is on, but just grab a beer and wait for a table.\n\nPros: Fun menu, great draft beer selection, beer cave!\nCons: Sometimes crowded and loud
2 ||| MSG? I'm not sure. Dim Sum is expensive and insanely busy, a lot of the food comes out cold but is delicious. That aside, eating dinner here can be awesome. The lunch and dinner combo meals are a ferocious deal and your tummy and wallet will thank you (your thighs won't). \n\nThe prices of entrees and appetizers are decent, with appetizer prices being high for a chinese restaurant and the entrees being on the lower end of average. The food in dining hours (non-dimsum) has always been spectacular with the exception of the last time I ordered when the meat was so old it had an odd stench and I couldn't even stomach it. That says a lot because mongolian beef is heavily seasoned! Yikes!  \n\nThe dead floating fish in the live fish tanks kind of killed my appetite on one occasion. I guess it says something that I continue to be a regular!
3 ||| This place has a nice environment along with good food. Happy hour here is probably the best for any mexican restaurants. What's better than $3 dollar drinks that are pretty exquisite and half off huge appetizer plates?
3 ||| Tasty burger!\n\nI hadn't been to a Whataburger in YEARS, but I was in the area and needed food. \n\nI ordered just a burger and drink. My first thought was that it was a little pricey at a little over $7, but I *did* order a double burger. \n\nThe people working there were very nice, service was fast, and the burger arrived hot and fresh. The double burger was worth the money, and the guy delivering it to my table asked if I needed condiments or a drink refill -- I thought that was nice.\n\nI got the green chile double burger, which consisted of two patties, two slices of cheese and a pile of green chiles on it -- they added a nice little kick. \n\nAs some other reviewers mentioned, the burgers are a bit on the juicy side, so that could be a problem if you're eating in the car or just don't like your burgers that way. Careful, they come out HOT enough to burn your mouth!
2 ||| Had dinner here on Monday night.  We ordered half a hai nan chicken, oyster hot pot, salt and pepper shrimp, and the pork chop combo rice plate.  The shrimp and the hot pot were good.  The hai nan chicken had no flavor at all.   The shredded pork in the combo plate came out cold.  It wasn't great but it wasn't awful either...  so hence the 3 star rating.
4 ||| RW&B is one of our favorite restaurants! The food is always fantastic and everyone is always so nice :) I just wish they would build one on the west side of town!
4 ||| Very clean and great service! I'm 7 months pregnant and was in need of a pedicure. They did a great job! The hot stones felt amazing on my calves and the lady really took her time massaging my feet. \n\nI'm pretty hard to please when it comes to manicures and pedicures but this place definitely left me satisfied. I will be returning in another 2/3 weeks for another pedi.
2 ||| Pros: \nBeautiful property\nEvery amenity you would need\nFridge brought to us free of charge\nFireplace and Jacuzzi tub\n\nCons: \nIf you stay in a casita you must walk to your room. If you get a ride you always have to tip. Request a room near the parking where you can get to your car. It was 1000 steps from the car to our room. \n\nThe website has glitches. Specifically on the dining page you can't view the menus. I let them know so hopefully this will get fixed. \n\nThe fridge is already full of stuff all on sensors.  If you move anything for 20 seconds you have bought it. We asked for another fridge and they brought us one so we could put water bottles and yogurts etc in there. \n\nNot on the same page with all guests. We were here for a conference being held at a nearby church. When we talked to other guests they mentioned that they got itineraries for special daily activities like wine tastings and chocolate fountain and movies and happy hours. We did not receive any of that. Several also received coupon for free breakfast and others did not. Everyone should get the same info and perks if we are all part of the same group.
0 ||| Manager sucked and food was worst.. If you aren't a regular they don't care about you
3 ||| China House is my new go to Chinese take out restaurant in Pittsburgh ever since yen's closed up and then changed hands. \n\nKeep in mind it's a take out place. You're not expecting to get gourmet food on gold lined plates - you're getting tasty food in plastic containers and not eating there. (There's only two tables)\n\nWith that in mind it's great. Big portions and I've never been let down. Sometimes you get free stuff too. Coupons for 10% off and free soda.
3 ||| I ordered one dish here, the shredded beef spicy noodle soup, and it was fantastic.  This is a fabulous dish done right at this establishment.  The portion size was suitable, with a good amount of shredded beef, put in a spicy and flavorful broth.  I would come here just for this soup at least once a week if I lived in Las Vegas.
0 ||| Man I wish I would have these reviews prior to ordering. The worst sushi ever! Granola bar here I come. Gagging.
4 ||| Very nice servers/wait staff.  Food was very good!  Spicy fried rice actually had some heat to it!  They even have REALLY good tasting fortune cookies!!
0 ||| Not sure what happened to Arby's, but every time I eat here I get sick. It hasn't been just me either. I know multiple people who have gotten sick from eating at Arby's. Which saddens me because it still tastes pretty good, just not like it use to.
0 ||| the worst company we ever dealt with from this local store to corp.we ordered a computer desk was told and writtin on receipt would take 3 to 4 days to deliver.after 5 days no show called l.v. store.was told on it's way told us in transit. days later got manager from store he said he'll call and gave us number to call. was told they don't know where it is.next day store manager called us said they never called him back.next day we called the same number manager gave us and was told again don't know where it is.now angry and called corp. customer service she acted appalled by what has happened and gave me manufacture of furniture she assured me it's in transit and will receive it tommorrow.gave me her direct line if it didn't.guess what nothing.next day saturday so calling her nobody there to talk to.next day went to l.v. store and demanded our money back.told us can't do anything cause in transit.told us when it arrives just bring it back to store for our refund.no can do we both have disabiled backs.so walked out store with no refund and big waist of our time.since then called and again told us don't know where it is but in transit.[13 days from ordering]then icing on the cake we got billed for it.cancelled this order through our credit card company.we will never ever use or buy anything from office max what a horrible company from our local store to corporate worst company we have ever dealt with. buyers beware use office depot or staples.
0 ||| Greyhound sucks. Terrible. Went on a trip to atlantic city and back home. Not one leg of the trip did the bus leave on time. Just terrible.
1 ||| Our waiter is delusional! Bad service! He filled up my drink and forgot who it belonged to in less than a minute and gave my drink to the table next to mine! Food is bland! Never coming back! What a gimmick of a place!
3 ||| The staff is very friendly at this location. I love the create your own salad option, and the produce is always fresh. Skinny bagels have become quite the trend, and Brueggers does it justice. At times, the coffee can be mediocre, but the bagels are always fresh, and Brueggers really is a Pittsburgh staple. A skinny zesty egg white breakfast sandwich is the perfect way to go for a lite breakfast.
3 ||| I have been here twice.\n\nThe fist time I went with my husband for dinner. It was the first place we dined after moving here from Chicago. As always we started with the oysters which were good quality and delicious. He loved his French Onion Soup as well. I had a special, the Halibut which had a lovely and inventive presentation. The only issue was the seasoning. I do not think it was seasoned at all. My husband had the same issue with the Short Ribs.  Maybe the kitchen just missed a step.  I do not like things over seasoned but this was bland.  The  Zinc Valrona Chocolate Souffle was simply amazing. I am not a chocolate lover, except for souffle. It was the perfect exclamation point to our dinner. \n\nI went for lunch with my mother who only eats plain burgers, plain chicken and pasta with marinara. I don't know how she manages to stay thin. We settled on Zinc. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a lovely arugula and tomato and a light sauce.  She of course had a plain burger which she raved about.  We split an order of frites, that were crisp and full of flavor. I loved the spicy sauce! \n\nI love the bistro decor and the service was good on both trips.  Glad I live close!
3 ||| More cheese than a Kenosha dairy farm. The limo driver was a bit pissy because we were running late. \n\nBut the pastor was really sweet, and I cried a little as I gave the groom away. We had a lot of fun snapping pics in the outdoor area. Don't ask about the \"incident\" there. I promised not to tell. \n\nMy friend and his new bride were happy, and that was all that mattered.
3 ||| Pottery Barn is known for its simple, yet classic style. It has a great location in the South Park Mall. The store is large, but it can be tricky getting around in there since it's stocked wall to wall with items. \n\nGreat bedding, house accessories, and dinnerware. I'm in love with some bath accessories and saving my dollars to get the set. If you are shopping to update your living space, make a stop here.
3 ||| Although I live nowhere near Summers, I happened to notice their produce stand on the way to an event at the Humane Society, so I stopped on my way home.  Lots of produce, of course, and a good selection of pickled and canned items as well.\n\nI found the staff to be so friendly, offering samples of a few different fruits and even going to the trouble to point out that they had less expensive lemons than the locally grown variety I was purchasing.  Both varieties of dates I purchased were excellent, although, why do they have to look like big 'ole cockroaches?  Can't someone engineer a more attractive fruit?\n\nAnyhow, definitely worth a stop if you live in the neighborhood.  Keep in mind their prices are for cash payment.  Using a card will cost you more, but I'm not sure how much.
3 ||| Ichiza, hope its just not me but everything I've heard about Ichiza I just can't agree with. You either absolutely love it or you just hate it. I wouldn't say I hated this place more on the side of I expected more from a place so hyped. Obviously this place is over hyped. \n\nJapanese Dishes: 3/5 I ordered a Gyu don (beef bowl $5.50) I love Japanese beef bowls with a side of Mapo Tofu (spicy tofu $4.15). I wasn't too impressed by their recipe. Most mapo Tofu's I've tried are spicy and the sauce is a bit thick but at ichiza I felt it was really bland and soupy. The Gyu don tasted like a beef bowl, not a Japanese beef bowl it didn't taste authentic, I also felt like something was missing. The portions were also pretty small. \n\nSushi: 4/5 After reading a few reviews I thought I'd try the deep fried California roll. I'm not much of a roll person or a deep fried person and California rolls aren't even sushi. BUT it was actually pretty good, I also ordered the Dragon roll which was OVER SAUCED. Its suppose to be eel,cucumbers, and avocado drizzled with eel sauce for a bit of color and flavor, but I think they went sauce happy on my roll. \n\nAlcohol: 5/5 The famous sake bombs at Ichiza, I suggest don't come here if its a date or a small group. Ichiza is known for big groups of drunks at their low tables slamming on the table doing sake bombs all night long!\n\nSeating: 4/5 I like Ichiza's Japanese style ambiance. You can get seated around the bar (which doesn't give you much elbow room next to the person beside you) or at their tables. I love their low Japanese tables its something you have to try at least once. \n\nWait: 3/5 The wait here can be pretty long up to 45 min depending on the time and day you you. On the weekends I know this place gets pretty busy and it's small so seating is limited. Expect a wait.
1 ||| My wife and I had breakfast here this morning and was disappointed in the visit.  First cup of coffee barely hot, second was good however.  As an artificial sweeteners user we were disappointed that REAL Sweet & Low and Equal were replaced by generic ones. The pumpkin muffin was dry and my wife questioned if they are made fresh daily. Our omelet was not that hot either.  Side of two pancakes were not of uniform size and not as good as they used to be. $20 for a below average meal, not worth it.
3 ||| We were looking around for a restaurant to go to in the Phoenix area & saw the raving reviews on Yelp of Welcome Diner in the heart of Phoenix, so we decided to stop by. It is completely in the middle of no where ... and in fact, for a minute or two as we were driving down Roosevelt St, we really thought that Siri was getting us lost. We got to the diner at the perfect time, however, because they were just turning on the lights and the small outdoor restaurant space was illuminated, making for a perfect setting to enjoy a Saturday night meal.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I left thinking, \"yes, fried chicken, absolutely delicious ... Everything else? Well, it was just alright.\"\n\nWe ordered two Hurricanes for drinks and a Bumblebee, a Big Jim, and the Poutine Fries for our meal. It was still happy hour (goes from 3p-7p ... pleasantly surprised that it was also on a Saturday), so the Hurricanes and Poutine Fries were $6 each (instead of regular price, $8). The Hurricanes were tasty but after a few sips, it kind of tasted like orange juice & liquor (not complaining, just saying it wasn't anything fancy). The Poutine Fries, in my opinion, had too much gravy but my date enjoyed them. I kind of wish we would've just gotten a plate of their regular fries because the fries themselves were really good. Their sandwiches were of course huge, very messy, and a little difficult to eat, but the fried chicken with the honey on the Bumblebee was so tasty, it was worth it. I removed the chicken off the biscuits and the biscuits were ignored; also, I thought that the honey mustard was unnecessary and I'm not a huge fan of pickles so I picked those off too. I'd say that I really wouldn't mind just ordering fried chicken and honey next time if/when we go back. My date enjoyed the Big Jim. He liked the combination of cheese, gravy, and chicken all together.\n\nThe people who worked there were really nice and came by and asked us if everything was good. After a while though, I could feel that what I had eaten was way too heavy. In hindsight, I probably would've ventured to try the Vegan Jackfruit Po'Boy or the fish po'boy since those seem like lighter options.\n\nDefinitely a place worth checking out ... Just not one that I'd visit frequently.
1 ||| Let me preface by saying I've worked in many kitchens and I'm from NY.  The first time I went to Mario's it was dismal. The alfredo sauce was broken. The shrimp Parmesan was literally boiled shrimp with seasoned canned tomato sauce and mozzarella. I'm not sure why it's wasn't breaded, but it made me sad. \n   I did go back though to taste their \"New York Style\" pizza. Let me tell you it's not, and it's very over priced. \n   I hear good things about their garlic knots. I'm not sure if that's enough to bring me back though.
3 ||| This is very cheap food - the eggs and bacon are good, veggie omelet not so much.  Service is amazing and you are really made to feel welcome - I think the better call is the pancakes or french toast.
0 ||| Why on earth does everyone have such a terrible attitude! We stopped in for a quick chicken sandwich & some wedges. The girl who waited on us, Monier (?) Brown had an attitude from the moment we walked in. While taking our order she had her eyes rolled up to the ceiling the entire time, tapping her nails on the register! We were so nice & didn't deserve that at all! I ordered food but after hearing & seeing her terrible attitude, Bobby decided not to order. She literally slammed my cup down & then informed us their pop machine wasn't working. We had a choice of sweetened, unsweetened or raspberry tea as well as water. Her attitude was just beyond disgusting & rude!! We ender up asking her name to call corporate. We couldn't find the corporate number & ended up speaking to the shift manager who said there is no corporate number bc they are transitioning (yeah right) . The manager said she would handle it. That didn't seem to change anything because the cashier & her terrible attitude were still at the register representing this store in a terrible way!!! Never again!!
3 ||| I wouldn't eat here for other meals, just breakfast.\n\nThey've got some decent dishes and actually just added some new $5.99 breakfast plates. On my visit this past weekend, I ordered up their egg, cheese & jalapeno enchiladas, which come smothered in a tasty tomatillo green sauce. I also added a side of red skinned breakfast taters for 99c.\n\nWe like to order up their \"hibiscus coolers\" with our late morning breakfasts. Sparkling wine + cranberry juice. Try it out!\n\nIf you sign up for their \"E club\" you get a free breakfast coupon on email. It's a risk free way for you to try them out! http://www.mimiscafe.com/EClub.aspx
3 ||| This place is pretty awesome. The honey garlic pork chops are highly recommended. We also got the pan fried noodles and wonton egg noodle soup. My favorite dish was the chicken and egg roll vermicelli! Took off one star for service. I had to get my own water...twice. Overall pretty decent food.
0 ||| I booked a night at this resort hotel because my daughter had a volleyball tournament in the area, and they had a special for 50% off suites. I wasn't impressed for a number of reasons.  First, even after the discount the rate was $124.00 which included an $8.00 (normally $30.00) \"resort fee\" which included things that any other cheaper hotel/motel would offer for free like local calls. Second, for the price I would expect modern things, like maybe a FLAT SCREEN T.V.! Come on, they've been around for what, 10 years now? And a high dollar place like this can't afford one? Another annoyance was the fact that their high speed internet access costs $15.99 a day. I can get free high speed internet at any motel/hotel for less that $50.00 a night. Other annoyances include a t.v. remote that didn't work, and a shower head that was so loose that it almost came off when I tried to adjust it. I would never, ever pay $200.00 a night for this place, and regret even paying what I did.
4 ||| I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation, so I decided to stop in to Star Nails in Bellevue. I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.\n\nThe salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.\n\nNancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.\n\nThe pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.\n\nNancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.\n\nThis is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.\nEND TMI\n\nEven though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.\n\nThe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.\n\nThe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.\n\nAgain, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.\n\nThey also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.
3 ||| Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed.
1 ||| I've been going here since 2000 but never have fallen in love with it like everyone else. Maybe I'm weird. Maybe I've got a very sensitive palette. Maybe I'm just not average, but I find Mama Ricotta's well below average and very very very salty.  I'm not someone who shies away from salt- I always have it on my eggs, etc.  But it seems like recently, everything at Mama's is over seasoned.  A lot of the dishes like the Pasta Primavera is very unremarkable so generally I like the chicken carciofi the best, but perhaps because of the capers it is so salty I can never finish it. I went there for a business lunch (basically the only reason I'll go) and had a roasted beet salad. I thought I was in the clear with a salad, but no- it was so salty too! A salad?? And not a nicoise salad?? It was very strange and it was very overdressed. Perhaps next time I'm forced to go, maybe I should try a sandwich? \n\nThe other complaint i have about this place is the service. One time recently the server was really inattentive. The second time, the server was really bitchy (and it was a guy). I've never understood how someone who relies on tips is smug and rude. Anyway that paired with the mediocre food means I'm never going to intentionally go here. I'd opt for Fiamma, Luciano's or Hawthorne's Pizza before here any day.
3 ||| I did not get a sandwich from here. I ordered the spicy ramen noodles since it was a chilly, rainy day. I was genuinely shocked on how amazing it was! Not that I didn't think it would be good, but it was seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had. I now crave it at least once a week! \n\nNot only did the amazing soup earn them the 5 stars. The service was awesome. I only ate about half a bowl of soup and asked for a to-go container. The lady came out and separated my noodles from the broth and put them in different containers. She also explained to me how to reheat it properly so it doesn't ruin the flavor. She then taped them tightly shut so it didn't leak in my car.\n\nFYI this is an \"order at the counter\" type of place. This type of superb service was totally unexpected, but greatly appreciated. I was able to eat the rest of my ramen the next day and it tasted just as fresh and flavorful as when it was first served. This was all thanks to the wonderful service of this sandwich shop.
0 ||| This place gets a 1 star because the server was nice besides that WOW We ordered the spinach artichoke Dip ( I have had at other applebees) It came out looking like someone dumped a can of Cream spinach in a bowl it didn't even have the cheese on top just green mush. The chips looked like the bottom of the bag and tasted like it to stale and super salty. I ordered the Chicken Penne it came out with mushy over cooked noodles with Alfredo thrown on top the chicken looked like scraps of a leftover plate. All I can say it Yuk. The bread was still frozen in the center. I have had this dish at other Applebees and it never looked or tasted like this one. My Husband got Fish & Chips ( We also have had at other Applebees) This one came out on a plate not a basket. The fish was a dark Brown color like it was fried in old grease and under the fish was a pool of yellow grease. The forgot the Fry's Haha they actual forgot the chip part of Fish & Chips. We called the server over and right away she knew what was wrong and stated she could tell the Fish was way to greasy. The Manager came over and just brushed everything off. I do not believe he tried to fix the situation. We did not want replacement food so we tipped the waitress because it's not her fault the Kitchen sucks and we left never to return. Applebees Surprise is off the list. Worst Applebees we have ever been to. You are better off with Burger King.
4 ||| Amazing food and even better service. We went here for my wife's birthday based on a deal we found on travelzoo. The owner right away gave my wife a free drink worth $30. Throughout the rest of the night out waiter took extra special care of us. My wife even went as far as letting him pick her dinner for her. Every bit of the food we ordered was amazingly good and we could tell it was home cooked. No chain food here. I had one of the specials, fresh fish from Hawaii and it never tasted so good. The soups taste just like something my grandma would have made.
3 ||| Had this for a breif meeting and it was so great! The house salad dressing had so much flavor. &the chicken pizza rolls so tasty. Nothing not to love about this place.
3 ||| Orlando the Employee was above awesome, with his customer service. Anytime i have a issue he seems to be the one who always helps me. This is why i choose Walgreens plus one stop shopping when you dont need to make a Wally World run and deal with the crowds. THANKS ORLANDO AND WALGREENS.
0 ||| Absolutely the worst! I have lived here for about 3 years and things have been fine. Within the past 4-6 months the owners have changed and service/experience is dismal! When I've had to go to the office to speak with them they continually close early (45 minutes to an hour) and play coy as if the door was locked by some ultimate force outside their understanding. We lose water service on average once a month-often times with no warning. When calling the emergency service number they are certain to know nothing of it in addition their prime directive is not bothering the property manager with such trivial matters. I have been waiting over a month for a service request. When they finally did come to repair the issue, they replaced the appliance with a broken one and I am not waiting for them again to rectify their sub-par work. There have been a number of break-ins, my parents vehicle being one of them. There is no security, gate is constantly broken, pool may as well not exist as it is always \"locked for service\". Parking is a nightmare as we only have one assigned spot. There is, however someone always parked in our spot. When I've told the office they tell me that I can put a sticker on the vehicle if I wish...they won't do anything. The place is disgusting, run-down, infested by cockroaches, and run by the most incompetent and unsympathetic individuals. I cannot get out of this lease fast enough. Stay away-you've been warned.
1 ||| The only couple things that were good were the tea and the bread. \n\nThe four of us ate for lunch and the food was barely warm. Two of us tried the butter squash tortellini. It was to have crispy prosciutto and it was soggy and the butternut squash was cut way to big. \n\nAnother had the shrimp pasta.  It was very bland even after adding salt and pepper.\n\nWill not return to this chain.
3 ||| After a 4 hour ride to Pittsburgh, I made it to my first Pittsburgh eatery in anticipation for a greasy unhealthy sandwich. After lukewarm to poor reviews of Primanti Bros., we opted to go to Uncle Sam's for lunch. I ordered an Italian sandwich that came with fries for $6.90. The bread was soft and chewy and the cold cuts were glistening from the toaster oven. Mixed with some standard sandwich fixings and thin cut fries, a great first meal to start the Pittsburgh weekend.
0 ||| Never received worst customer service in my life! From the phony friendly tellers to Chalise Jacobs, the Branch Manager, it was the worst banking experience of my life! I will never bank with Wells Fargo and I will avoid the downtown branch at all costs!
1 ||| I LOVE Whole Foods as a company, but this has got to be one of the worst locations in AZ. Maybe I'm spoiled with the shelf space and layout of the one on Mayo in Scottsdale (a flagship store built in 2008), but this Shea store is about a third of the size, if that. EVERY time I have gone there (it's much closer to me than the Mayo location), they NEVER have what I need. Whether it's a type of hummus, cosmetic, vitamin, flax oil, it's never there like it is on Mayo. They just don't have the shelf space.\n\nToday, I tried one more time for Barlean's flax oil. Oh, they had it, but the 16oz sizes had been sitting on the shelf since November (it says on the bottles when they are created) and due to expire in one month. Shows how little product they move. They just don't have the customer turnover. I looked for a hummus they had at the Mayo location and they didn't carry that either. When I asked about the brand, they tried to sell me something else that I didn't want. Weak. \n\nMy other major complaint and apparently it is a common one according to the staff, is that they have a HUGE display of bath salts (open) and soaps sitting out near all the food smack in the middle of the store. If you want flax oil, you'd better be good at holding your breath. It was so strong that just from walking through the area once, my boyfriend asked me \"what is that smell, it smells like cheap perfume soap or something\" on me when I got home. Wow. It's really bad for anyone with perfume sensitivities which is a lot of people in AZ, one of the worst allergy zones in the country. \n\nI mean, Whole Foods is supposed to be a mecca of health, not stench and inconvenience. \n\nThis long-time customer will be exclusively shopping (and dropping lots of cash) at Mayo from now on. I'm tired of wasting my time and breathing the fumes at Shea.
4 ||| This is one of my favorite yarn shops in Charlotte. It's not the closest, it's not the cheapest... but if I want something interesting & beautiful, I know I can find it here.\n\nAll of the employees of the shop (there don't appear to be that many) are very helpful and friendly, but the owner is simply amazing.\n\nSeriously, I've only been in the shop 6 or 7 times over last few years, but she remembers my name, the yarn I picked up last, the project I was making with it, and even the person I came in with a few times before and what they were making. Because she remembers so many details, she's able to make fantastic suggestions on yarn & notions. I haven't been disappointed yet with any of her suggestions.\n\nI'm not sure if she has a database installed directly in her brain or what, but she makes you feel very welcome. If anyone ever needs lessons on how to grow a small business & make customers feel right at home, just stop by Charlotte Yarn for a few minutes.
2 ||| We were driving in from CA, coming in to visit our friends in AZ.  We got hungry, wanted to grab a bite to eat.  We saw their billboard, which attracted us to check it out.  We pulled up, there were no cars parked in front and they had no customers.  We took a chance anyways. They had a large selection on their menu which was a bit overwhelming to stare up, while the cashier guy just stared at the 4 of us looking clueless.  We would've appreciated some offer of assurance or suggestions.  We ended up getting two large pizzas, and one order of boneless wings.  Don't bother getting the boneless wings cause you might as well just go to McDonalds to get their McChicken nuggets!  Thy didn't look like wings at all.  The buffalo chicken BBQ was a bit on the spicy tangy taste, so I had to pass on that. The other pizza we had there was tomatoes & cheese.  It's def a local pizza joint, they got busier later on.  The pizza was alright, made our hungry tummies content for the time being.
4 ||| The best pizza on the west side... 51st Ave and T-bird.  It's a Mom and Pop shop that I've grown up with... moved away, and happened to go back recently so I can review it. :)\n\nThey are still the same as always... the same red and white checkered table covers, the placemats of Italy... \n\nAnd the friggen awesome wings and pizza.\n\nHoly crap I had forgotten how good they were... and they are now offering other flavors of wings, like Garlic and Parmesan... altho the medium flavor does fine with me. :)\n\nThe pizza... it's floppy... it's greasy... the stuff falls off, but you can't help but just want to eat more.  ESPECIALLY when you get down to the crust. Their crust is AWESOME.\n\nAnother couple of cool things... they have1.50 coors lite during races, .99 beers during happy hour, and for those of us who are used to very expensive beers... their normal price is 2.75 for beers.\n\nBar that is attached has all day every day $2 drafts.\n \nService: in the beginning it was iffy... there was no smiling from this chick.  But she seemed to relax with us as the food was delivered and things went well.\n\nSo... if you want a local place to check out some wings, pizza and beer... go here.
1 ||| As soon as I walked into this chipotle I was greeted by a line that was almost out of the door. The staff was working very hard to take orders and cook the food and the line went much faster than I thought it would, no complaints there. \n\nThe issue tonight was a matter of health. Simply put, the steak in my burrito bowl was  grossly undercooked. So undercooked that the meat was actually cold. I get it, it's busy so the food is being rushed but there is no excuse for this egregious error. \n\nUsually this type of transgression would get an automatic one star as my health was potentially compromised but I bumped them a star because the staff quickly made me another bowl and because they did such a good job handling the large crowd.\n\nThis better be an isolated occurrence because next time I'll have to report them to the state
2 ||| Food: the food at Harris grill is the epitome of average, nothing is great and nothing is terrible, everything is mediocre, there are plenty of options for vegetarians, and they have an unnatural love of bacon here, the appetizers are more interesting than the entrees\n\nPrice: too expensive for the quality of the food, the prices aren't staggering, but considering the quality of the food it feels like you are overpaying for nearly everything\n\nDrinks: beer is one of the strengths of Harris, always a good selection of draft beers, and an extensive bottle beer list, the mixed drinks are all average to below average though and the bartenders do not mix good drinks, aside from the signature Frozen Cosmo I would stay away from everything, including the mojito\n\nAtmosphere: this is what you pay for at Harris, they have a beautiful porch for outdoor seating in the front, an equally nice back porch, and the inside decor is pleasant as well, the menus are very cleverly organized and a lot of personality was put into the presentation\n\nService: the service is average at best, we have had meals and specific orders confused multiple times, service is also slow\n\n(+): great location, great atmosphere, good beer\n\n(-): overpriced food, poor service, worse bartending\n\nWould I go back again? Only because I live nearby.
3 ||| I've eaten here twice now.  First time I had the 4 mini beef hotdogs.  If you like hotdogs try these.  I love that they toast the buns.  The service was not the best this night.  Dishes and empty glasses were left on the table while many servers and busboys walked right by them. I went again for Sunday football after seeing all the t.v's they had and being from MI it's hard to find a place to watch the Lions play that has decent t.v's. We sat up to the bar and Nanci was the bar tender.  EXCELLENT service! She explained quite a few of the menu items and drinks I ate the half order of sausage and peppers and onions.  WAYY too much food but so tasty.  My husband had the mediterranean pizza and was impressed with the crust and flavor of it all.  We will be back for sure.
3 ||| Food is delicious. My favorite is the Pollo Rico. Came in during happy hour for a take out order, the bartender was extremely nice and friendly. I already love this place but the service I got today was outstanding for just a takeout order.
2 ||| I have never eaten at the Green Lantern, but whatever.  What I HAVE done is gone to karaoke there.\n\nI am not the kind of person to enjoy a \"hip\" bar.  I don't want ironic metal on the jukebox or $8 flirtinis.   What I want is totally unpretentious karaoke renditions of Unskinny Bop from people that still look like they graduated high school in 1991, and $2.50 vodka and cranberry juices.
1 ||| This has always been a great local stop for a cold beer and sandwich but when I walked in to see a 92% sanitation grade displayed on the wall, it gave me pause. The service here is always quick and friendly and the food is usually tasty. This trip however, not so much. The wings looked an tasted like they came out of the freezer and prepared hours before and the onion rings were tasteless. Everyone has an off night and this time it disappointed. I like this place but with a block of new restaurants coming in all the time, if you want to compete in this ever changing market, you better step up your game.
0 ||| I too have had a nightmare experience with another Fletcher tire in Chandler.\nThey broke something on my car, said they don't have the know how to fix it, and then made a bunch of dumb excuses as to why it wasn't their fault.\nThe excuses they used made it obvious that they don't have the slightest clue about how a car works mechanically.\nTalking to their management does nothing.  \nI highly reccomend that you find somewhere else to go.  The company is a shambles from the top down.
0 ||| This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant near downtown now they raised their prices and are charging for bland fried rice for lunch and the soup looks like a bowl of snot! I will not be back!!
0 ||| If negative stars were available, this place would get them!!!! Absolute idiots. You have one job and that's to make a pizza and you can't even get that right. Not only were the toppings wrong but they didn't cut it either. I called them and they have very poor communication skills also!!!!! Dominos pizza is horrible anyways!!!! Can't even believe I ordered from there in the first place!!! So much for being close and convenient!!!!!!
3 ||| I am surprised at myself for not writing a review before now. I thought I had.\nSo sorry to Regals.\nThis place has been great since day one. Everything they clean here is fantastic.\nThey do an excellant job and the price is right.\nThey staff is always pleasent. I do not think I have ever had a bad time here.\nShows you someone knows how to do business.\nCash or check for all work and you pre pay,\nClosed on Sunday.
1 ||| I went and stayed here during my annual spring training vacation as I am a huge Angels fan. The employees were friendly and the lobby was nice but that is about it. Our room smelled old and moldy, the T.V. was a tube TV from the early 90's. The elevator was barely functional and the jacuzzi was just a little hotter than the pool. Downtown chandler was awesome as it was the first time in that area. I will however find an alternate place to stay next time I am in the area.
2 ||| I'm a fan of Desert Swirl. The prices are a little high but you get what you pay for. HUGE waffle cones of frozen yogurt that actually tastes GOOD. I tried their marshmallow flavor and it was unbelievable.\n\nIt's a good summertime treat, try taking the kids here once instead of the regular DQ for a switch and see how you like it. It's worth a try.
3 ||| For what it is (a shop that your wife drags you into on a Saturday to grab a gift), it's awesome.  \n\nIt has all sorts of stuff from home decor to gifts to birthday cards.  All sorts of stuff.  Some is just your basic stuff but some is cool.  Will admit a lot of stuff is overpriced (like a $75 book that was on amazon in the $30s), but for what it is and it's immediate gratification, it's very nice and well run.  For the amount of inventory they have, the space is managed incredibly well and they keep it looking extremely neat.
4 ||| I have food allergies and need to sometimes omit certain ingredients from a menu item.  There was no problem with that here and they were willing to even add other ingredients to make up for the ones taken out.  I ordered the chicken coconut soup and Thai fried rice with veggies and couldn't be happier it is so tasty and made special for me.  Bravo Szechuan!
3 ||| Great value and casual diner experience. Love their pizzas! Be ok with young people or go somewhere else!!
1 ||| Really odd store. I went in to ship stuff for work with a pre-paid shipping label but no envelope. Guy at counter said to grab an envelope from the side- not a ups envelope but a tan blank one like you'd get at Office Depot. Weird but okay. Then when I checked out they tried to charge me for the envelope. Very odd UPS store experience.  Do not recommend.
4 ||| What can I say? The BEST JAPANESE RESTAURANT IN VEGAS! ^_^ \nI love their rolls, their sashimi are so fresh and delicious!  My fav dinner dish is Teriyaki beef, they are smoky!  They have Teppan table but I always prefer the sitting at the tatami room, cause it's so cozy and private if you want to bring your partner.  Service is wonderful, and food came out fast.  For desert, I recommend the green tea mousse, they have the most prefect taste, not too sweet and not too creamy.
0 ||| Horrible customer service everytime. Rude and very slow. They are almost always out of several flavors of bagels, really is it that hard to figure out that people are going to order plain bagels everyday.
3 ||| So far so good! The management seems nice for most part, the 1 Bedroom apartments are big and spacious. The price is more than the average price, but the community seems good. Not enough bike racks are evenly spaced in the complex. The Gym is ok with decent equipment, and the swimming pool is 4ft , hey but they have a hot tub :) ! Regarding the locality well, we are glued right in between Castle and Le Girls, can get a bit shady when its dark.
4 ||| I'm going to start off by making the very bold statement that for most of last 10 years, Umi has been the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It's not just the best Japanese restaurant (which it is by an extraordinarily wide margin), but the best overall restaurant in the city.  Why such acclaim you might ask?  The answer lies in Umi's consistency in providing delicious cuisine with outstanding service.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say it, but when I first went to Umi about 10 years ago (has it been that long already?), I didn't like sushi.  I thought the texture was strange and it tasted too fishy.  The first time I had the omakase at Umi, the veil was lifted over my eyes.  Never had I imagined that Japanese food could be so delicious!  The constantly changing flavors and textures with each subsequent course was mind-spinning.  It would not be hyperbole to say that it was life-altering because it opened my eyes to the world of finer cuisine and made me want to seek out foods that I had been too afraid or stubborn to try in the past.\n\nOn a recent visit to Umi, I was surprised to see that there had been a change to the omakase menu.  It was always as big as you wanted to make it (like Troy Polamalu who likes the $250/person omakase), but now there were 3 options of a 7-course plus dessert, an 11-course plus dessert, and a \"trust Mr. Shu\" omakase.  When I inquired what that meant, they said \"that's what the Steelers get.\"\n\nOn this occasion, my buddy and I got the 11-course omakase.  It was delicious as always and included a dizzying array of sashimi preparations, the much-acclaimed miso cod, and spicy and tender rock shrip tempura.  A very pleasant surprise was a new course served in two spoons.  One had poached lobster and the other had Kobe beef.  Each was covered with fois gras.  This was absolutely decadent and brought back memories for me of the fois gras sushi in O-Ya in Boston (which was the New York Times best new restaurant in the U.S. a few years ago).\n\nUmi's biggest criticism has always been that it's too expensive.  Although it's true that it can easily be the most expensive restaurant in Pittsburgh, you absolutely are getting your money's worth.  From very personal (and somewhat disappointing experience), high-end Japanese restaurants in bigger cities are just as good as Umi but MUCH more expensive (like sometimes twice as expensive).  I'll also make the bold statement that for what you get, Umi is a steal and Pittsburgh has been very lucky to have it.\n\nService is always outstanding.  On my most recent visit, Drew was our waiter who in my opinion is one of the nicest and best waiters in the city.  That really adds to the experience.  Also on my most recent visit to Umi, I was very pleasantly surprised that they had a free valet!  Parking has always been terrible in that portion of Ellsworth Ave.  The valet made it so simple, and it was free!  Kudos to Big Burrito for making that outstanding decision.\n\nI don't think it's fair to blame the restaurant for not seating you if you don't have a reservation.  Umi is very small and is always very crowded on the weekends.  As mentioned in other reviews, you can sit at the normal tables or the sunken \"traditional\" Japanese tables.  Some advice from my wife is that if you're wearing a dress, don't sit at the sunken tables.  When you get up, you might be revealing more than you intend!
4 ||| had the super coctel..very fresh!!
1 ||| Disappointed with the bitter coffee and less than desirable ambiance.  It is loud and uncomfortable inside.
3 ||| The Chihuly exhibit makes it worth another trip! As an Arizona native, I had not considered returning for some time. Loved the glass, seamless integration with the cacti. The blooming prickly pear and bird watching was also nice. Hurry before the exhibit leaves May 18!
2 ||| This is your basic, garden variety big chain hotel.  It is very convenient to a lot of restaurants and shopping, but it was hard to find, tucked back in a corner next to the highway.  They need a bigger sign!  There is a pool and a hot tub, neither of which were being utilized because I happened to be in Phoenix to experience perhaps 25% of their total annual rainfall in 2 days!  UGH.  Rain in the desert.  There's no controlling the weather.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was good, it had all the usual stuff you expect, eggs were fluffy, not hard and congealed.  Some of the bacon was crispy, and some was chewy, something for everyone.\n\nThe one very odd thing was the front desk crew on hand the first morning.  Two dudes no older than 23.  They high-fived each other twice and said stuff like \"good call dude\", \"way to go\", and they were talking about a room opening up that had 2 beds in it instead of one.  OK, maybe that's too much detail but geez guys, let's be a tiny bit more professional, ok?  When the high schoolers are running the hotel, it doesn't inspire a ton of confidence.
3 ||| Not a bad lil gym.  Not an over abundant amount of equipment like I'm used to, but it gets the job done. However, I've never had to wait to use anything there even during what I would consider a peak time to go.  This is a great place to go if you're looking for an in and out work out.  This review will be updated, I'm going to try some classes and get back to you yelpers!
4 ||| Amazing breakfast place!  Everything is always so fresh and tastes great!  TINY place and usually has a wait but it is well worth it.  The wait usually isn't too long either.  I would have to say one of the best breakfast joints I've found in the valley in 9 years living here!
3 ||| This place gets 4 stars from me, but mostly because I'm such a sucker for soda shoppes.  This place is cozy (i.e. small) with booths along one wall and a bar with mounted stools along the other.  Their menu is mostly filled with unhealthy fried/greasy foods but all of it is extremely tasty.  Last time I ate here I got a grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich and it was delicious.  The real reason I like this place is because of their desserts, which are mostly ice cream.  I've had a brownie ice cream sundae that was wonderful and last time I was here I got a hot fudge milk shake that was gone in seconds.  I don't think their ice cream is really all that special, but for some reason it tastes better to me when it's being served in a soda shoppe environment.  Another thing I like here are the prices, everything's very reasonable.
3 ||| We frequent this place about 3-4 times a year.  I usually get either the cheese steak with peppers and mushrooms or one of the hoagies.  Had the cheese steak yesterday and it was pretty decent...could have used a bit more cheese though.  Lots of meat and veggies.  The roll was really good.  Overall, not in the same league as the cheese steaks at Jersey Mike's though.
3 ||| 03/13/13\n\nGot out of bed this morning specifically to go and pick up the special order I'd placed for Currant-caraway Irish soda bread, which was slated for 8a.  I arrived around at around 830a, but none of the bags already prepared had my name on it.  After checking and re-checking the bags for my name and not finding any, the mid-50s to early-60s' female clerk finally grabbed one out of the shelves.  She then asked if I wanted it sliced, and I said yes, but quickly asked if I could get half of the bread sliced up now.  She said she could cut the bread in half, and I thought that she would follow the instructions through.  When I saw her package the two halves together in one bag, I asked if she could take half of the bread and put it through the slicer, and she said \"whatever you want.\"  To round out the transaction, I had a cranberry scone added to my order.\n\nI had a little sample of the bread while driving back home, and it was good, but not as great as those tiny rolls I tried at the Yelp party eleven days ago.  I much-prefer the smaller ratio of crust to tender bread.\n\nHere's to healthy eating!  As with most things in life, enjoy carbs with moderation!  :)
4 ||| Nova's is a food anchor to Plaza Midwood contributing to the area's free spirited vibe in a tasty way.  The price however, may also be part of it's role as an anchor since I feel the cost of their baked goods weigh a little heavy on its patrons.  \n\nThen again, most places have really been pushing higher costs.  The artisan breads sold here are a prime example of this but then again, even Harris Teeter is charging $5.00 for a small loaf of bread.  Still, if you can get past the pricing, the breads and other baked goods sold here are pretty OK.  Nothing that will blow you away but good nonetheless.\n\nSomething that I really like about this place is that they have a full coffee bar so you can grab a coffee or mocha or whatever along with a little something to eat and then chill on their couch with a book or grab a table and hang out with friends as you enjoy your treat.\n\nIf you are curious, when compared to Nona's in the University area, Nova's has a much more welcoming feel.  So, in my opinion, Nova wins on vibe and Nona's wins on food and they both weigh in equally on pricing.
2 ||| My car was in a shop nearby and I looked for the closest bar to wait it out.  I did meet some really friendly company in this place and ended up having a good time.  \n\nFirst impression: the place is really really dirty.  I didn't want to drink out of my glass.  The bartender was MIA for the first 5 minutes and wasn't to quick to give me a refill either.  \n\nI came here because the other person that reviewed this place said it was a great sports bar.  I think The Sixth Sense was on the small TV and the food... well, if I didn't feel comfortable drinking out of my pint glass, I sure as hell wouldn't eat there.
3 ||| Went here for a Father's Day breakfast.  Besides lunch and dinner, they also serve breakfast all day.  Nice folks, darn good diner food, nice size portions.  Lots of old people come here, but they don't try to mug you in the bathroom or anything like that.
0 ||| Had problems with this room service option the first two nights I was here. House salad missing items , missing condiments,more just attention to detail. Called them and they offered me a $15 voucher great day three use the voucher outstanding everything perfect. Decided to go back for a day 4 bad mistake. Ordered the fillet it's supposed to be one of their specials. Incredibly tough. Ordered a baked potato with sour cream and butter you would think it would come on the side. But of course it didn't and it was completely melted throughout the styro foam container.  I could live with that but the house salad I ordered missing ingredients again but most of all no salad dressing. When I called back to tell them I don't want anymore vouchers just you all don't know anything about attention to detail. I let them know I was missing the salad dressing and the person who sent it insisted I must be missing it. Now they are coming back with more salad dressing. Honestly I am done with these folks I'll never use them again.  I love staying at Marriott properties but if this is what they recommend shame on them.
3 ||| This is an update to my review. This one is updated to mention the breakfast which is the only meal you should eat here. \n\nMost of the servers and hosts are great people, but I've heard from others that there is one who may be poaching customers to pad her tips. \n\nAs for the food,  the cooks keep their grill so hot, the eggs are always overcooked. But once you go through the ordeal of sending it back it usually comes back as ordered. But this should not happen most visits. \n\nAgain, breakfast should be the only meal you eat here as the lunch and dinner menu items are pretty poor quality.  Even though the eggs are always over cooked, everything else is not bad for breakfast.  1.99/2.99 breakfast special is a great deal. Menu items are a bit on the expensive side for the quality. Stick with the special.
0 ||| Went here the other night with my girl, worst filibertos I've ever been to. Chicken quesadilla and an arizona burrito took 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES!! The girl at the counter was rude and had this look on her face like she hated life and taking our order was just making it worse. The arizona burrito tasted like crap, I don't even know that it was carne asada. It tasted more like plain ground beef. The potatoes weren't fully cooked. The chicken quesadilla looked as if it was soaking in a pool of grease for the entire 20 minutes we waited. I will NEVER go back to this location, absolutely horrible. Stay away from this Filly B's.
0 ||| I'm done coming to this location. As the years have passed, this location has gone downhill. Can't they afford to hire more waitresses? It's not fair to anyone when it's one waitress to 15 customers.  I couldn't even get a refill. I wanted to go get it myself since the machine is in full view. The waitress tells me that customers aren't supposed to get their drinks themselves. Call me crazy, but I'd like to have a little more beverage with my meal.
1 ||| Lots of negative reviews here, and from what I'm gathering, a lot of it has to do with the location in the UNCC neighborhood. Well, I live by the one on South Blvd, and I have to say that Toppers is the best chain pizza around, at least TASTE wise. Being from Chicago, I am used to very flavorful pizza. I'm not hung up on the \"has to be like NYC pizza\" either, because I love all good pizza. But what makes Toppers a good pizza is the quality of their ingredients and the overall taste. Their sausage is VERY good, and their sweet marinara and cheese is also VERY good. This is the good part....\n\nNow the bad. This is also the MOST expensive pizza in Charlotte! Their coupons mostly consist of free bread sticks and soda. I can give a flying $^!*#$@ about these things when I'm ordering PIZZA! Because my wife and I don't like the same things on our pizzas, we order 2 MEDIUM size pies each with about 3 or 4 toppings. With tax, delivery and tip, this typically runs about $43.00!!! For TWO medium pizzas. Yup, that's right.\n\nNow compare that with Domino's, Papa John's, etc. Doing the math, I figure it's about 40% MORE in cost than Toppers. Is Toppers better than the others, Yes! Is it WORTH that much more.....well, that depends on your point of view and if you can afford $40+ pizzas. SOMETIMES I think it's worth it, sometimes I do NOT.\n\nI actually complained about the price, and the South Blvd Store Manager gave me a coupon for a free Med Pizza with whatever toppings I wanted. That was nice, but the one pizza I paid for still cost me $23.00! For a MEDIUM with 3 toppings! THAT is pretty steep.\n\nSo if anyone from Toppers Management is reading what folks have to say, they really need to re-think their pricing and sales strategies. They have a good product, but their pricing is just too high for this market.
4 ||| I decided to give them a 5 star. \n\nPastry: I tried the almond horn and the rosemary & sea salt foccacia. \nthe famous ALMOND HORN was brilliant. The pastry was packed with almond aroma. it was smooth and chewy in the inside and crispy on the outside covered with sliced almond pieces. It was divine. I was so full at the moment when i try sampling it. But i end up finishing the whole thing. My roommate loved it too. Love the fact that it was not too sweet. Just right. ROSEMARY AND SEA SALT focaccia was lovely as well. had it for breakfast with black tea and its just a match made in heaven.  \n\nService: The lady who was working there was just super duper friendly and nice. I dont understand why people are complaining about their service. She was overly kind and informative. Knew when each pastries come out from the oven and all that. \n\nOverall: It was a great experience. I am so glad that we have a small bakery like this in CU. It is a little far from the main campus area (30min walk from Green St) but it was worth it.  It is clear from the pastries that someone cares in the kitchen. I will go back next week to try the tiramisu. heard it was good. Def better than Pekera. (except the baguette).
2 ||| We liked the ambiance a lot. It had a cool feel to it. Also, the decor was very French, which we enjoyed.\n\nThe food was good, but we are not sure why everything is priced so high? It is definitely more expensive than it should be. $12 for a cup of onion soup? What?!
0 ||| I've never seen anything more ghetto in my life. Walmart is already disgusting, well times that by 3.6 million and you have the Nellis location. iky
0 ||| my girl friend and I stopped in cause its close, we sat in the bar and had drinks and ordered something to eat, I had a chicken club sandwich it came on a bun thought it would be on bread and quartered but no, tasted ok but was not what I had expected my girl friend had turkey club sandwich came on bread but same thing not what she expected, the fry's were like something frozen and heated up! not good, the waitress was friendly and seemed ok, to top it off my girlfriend left her wallet in the booth where we sat , when we got home we called to see if anyone turned it in they said yes, when we went back in to get it we noticed the $34.00's in it was gone, I told the waitress and  she had a very guilty attitude and pretty much could care less !! also there prices are high for what you get which is not very good, all in all I think these people are dishonest , we would not recommend this place at all!! I give it a big zero rating, if a manager there reads this I would be weary of your employee's, some one there is a thief.
0 ||| Dropped in for a quick bite on Sunday evening. Sat at the bar. After 10 min and the bartender being busy doing other things, we walked out. Won't be back!!
4 ||| Elegant Reflections does an impeccable job with alterations and they are reasonably priced.  If you go there, you will encounter Eva and she is awesome and knowledgeable.  They make me want to go through my closet and find things to get altered.
4 ||| Calzones are the best.
1 ||| Went here for my bday last year. We called to make reservations because from what people said we thought it was going to be a busy place and we planned on doing the hibachi grill so we were sure we needed them. When we arrived....there was not a single person in the place, and they had already been open for a couple of hours. Not a good sign. We decided against the hibachi and just went for the all you can eat sushi, which didn't turn out to be any cheaper than just getting a couple rolls of sushi. The food wasn't that great. The service was ok. I wasn't impressed at all...probably won't be back.
4 ||| I love having this CVS in the neighborhood. Located in Piper Glen Shopping Center and easily accessible for those of us out for a little exercise on the Greenway. Don't fret over the complicated parking situation (not many spaces directly in front of the building). You can pretty much park anywhere within the parking lot and not have to walk but 30 yards to get to their front doors. \n\nI appreciate this location for so many reasons. Not only is their staff easy to work with, but they really help with products in the store. It's not always easy to find which eye drops you're looking for among the menagerie of choices. They make the complex less complex with their knowledge of the store layout. \n\nThis location has a great Kodak photo printing center. We have visited several times to print a couple 4x6 prints and it's done in a snap. They staff jumps over to input the print code lickity split. Can't beat that fast service!\n\nThe pharmacy staff is so helpful. Multiple times, my wife and I have made it in and they've given us recommendations of over-the-counter products or medication from the shelves that will help our symptoms. Always helped and never hindered or hurt. SO friendly. They feel like neighbors. \n\nThanks to CVS for having a great location in the neighborhood! I'm proud to be called one of their patrons! Cheers!
3 ||| I.do not care what anyone says if you are in the mood for greasy delicious and heavy chinese go here...the mooshu pork and house fried rice are delicious...the sesame chicken and potstickers are to die for...gave it 4 stars because the decor is not great and the service is touch and go but its great if want great take out!!! They deliver too!!! Yay!!
4 ||| The hotel has an incredible amount of charm.  You get the feeling that you just stepped back in time when you walk into the lobby.  The elevators still have the classic rotating needle that shows what floor the elevator is on.  We stayed in the Governor's Suite, and it too was eking of nostalgia.\nUnfortunately some of the staff members did not have the same amount of charm to match the hotel's architecture and styling.  In particular, everyone we encountered at the front desk did not provide service you would expect at a classic establishment as this.  \nOn the other hand, the Valet Attendant exceeded my expectations.  He was very personable and helpful.  Furthermore, the bartender at the Ghost Lounge was equally personable and made us feel welcome each time we returned.  It appears that he recently purchased the lounge/bar.  He has a great personality and attitude.  I wish him the best.\nThe hotel is known for it's haunted nature.  I was not pleased to hear this.  Some may be attracted by this.  My over active mind kept me thinking of ghosts in the middle of the night. That's just my fault. \nOverall, a historic hotel with a lot of personality.  The hotel might benefit by training the front desk in proper hotel etiquette and professionalism.
4 ||| Loved this place...took my mom for mothers day and we were there for 5 hours getting wonderful services and had lunch by the pool. Cant wait to go back
3 ||| I've stayed here two times now and I love this place. The rooms are very big with big bathrooms, full fridge and a separate bedroom. The pool is nice as well.\n\nThe golf course is in decent shape but not overly difficult. Still quite fun.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the parking situation. If you take one of the building close to pool you will walk a ways to your car (there is a shuttle if you want).
4 ||| I love this place with all my heart. I love this place
3 ||| I got the tuna sandwich on a baguette with mac and cheese on the side. The tuna was like a fancy tuna salad with herbs mixed in. The mac and cheese had yummy \"crumbles\". The atmosphere was cute and quaint, and the wait staff were very attentive, and the prices were fair.
3 ||| i have not been here in a while but when i did go the food was rather good not too expensive at all i would return to this location
4 ||| The staff is not only knowledgeable, they're friendly & courteous. Doesn't matter if it's a question on glass for a picture frame or to have an emergency window (board-up & replaced) I have never been disappointed!
3 ||| This place is an average Thai restaurant - nothing to dance and sing about. We ordered take out pad thai and the pad see ew. Both dishes were dry and the noodles seemed to be undercooked. \n\nHowever, the flavors of both dishes were great. I really appreciated the spice levels they offered. I ordered both dishes a spicy #8 and it delivered a nice spicy kick that wasn't unbearable - It added a great spicy flavor. \n\nAs much as I prefer my noodles to be tender, moist and juicy, I couldn't stop eating them because I loved the flavors so much. Maybe next time I'll try eating at the restaurant with hopes that it will come out juicier!
1 ||| We went after 9pm, they have a special menu.  You need to ask for it.  We ordered 9 dishes, these are the ones that suck out in my mind:\n\n1.  Peking Spare Ribs - Flavorful, crispy, and just so good.\n2.  Rice soup with shredded pork and preserved egg - not enough flavor.\n3.  Fried Flounder - Crispy, fresh, and the sauce on the side was with a hint of spicy\n4.  Sliced fish with greens - fish was fresh and soft, needed a little more flavor\n5.  Beef stew hot pot - the beef was tender, radish was ok, again the sauce needed more flavor\n6.  Beef stew with noodle soup - that was not too bad.  Flavor was there, but the noodles were a little too soft.\n\nOverall everything was not bad, the service was good, and prices are too bad either.
4 ||| The wait was not long to get a table,  our server Morgan was great, friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. We always get the steam pots, we tried the bucket of shrimp, which was great. A few new menu items, next time we will be more adventurous and try something new. My go to is always the Rajun Cajun, and have never been disappointed. The staff is all great and interactive. The GM Steve has always stopped by our table to check on our experience. I go to both locations, but this one is my favorite. It is always a very welcoming experience.
1 ||| Horrible customer service.  I just watched the man in front of me get treated like crap over a $1 additional charge.  The cashier was dismissive and flat out rude.  I won't be coming back here and neither will that man.  She just lost this business 2 customers over $1 and her bad attitude.   The quality of the wash was decent hence the 2 stars.
3 ||| Go to place for special occasion.  Just don't count calories.  Expect great    Steaks, extensive wine list, tasty apps and save some room for desert.\n\nBone in ribeye is one of the best.  Mash is always seasoned perfectly.   Very good service as well.\n\nOnly downside is the large bill at the end of the meal.
3 ||| Love this place!  The food really does taste like you're eating at a Roman Trattoria. It's pretty small on the inside so watch your elbows. Its also in an unassuming location in the middle of a strip mall so keep your eyes out for the big sign that says they've been on The Food Network otherwise you might just drive on by.\n\nTheir Spaghetti Carbanara may have been the best I've ever had.  Buon Appetito!
1 ||| Slow service! Didnt really feel like I was a valued guest. I think I would feel better spending my money somewhere else, like the Dennys across the street. Then the waitress double charged our cards.
3 ||| The food here is good. My husband and I are new to Indian food, so I can't speak to its authenticity or how good it is in comparison to other Indian food, but overall we really liked the food here. The chicken tikka masala was particularly delicious, though there were lots of very good options at the buffet. The naan was also good (and needed to cool the mouth every so often).\n\nThe service was okay! Nothing good or bad to say there. The inside was really not all that awesome. That was the major part that brought down the experience for us; it looked like it could do with a face-lift.
0 ||| Where to start?\n\nA friend recommended this place.\n\nService:\n\nWe went later in the night so it wasn't busy at all. However, you would've thought it was packed because we had to wait a while to get drinks; refills; our order taken; condiments after getting our food (had to ask him twice); and finally, the bill.\n\n\nFood:\n\nAfter reading the reviews on Yelp, and our friend's suggestion, I really wanted to try their chicken fried steak. Well, that was a bad idea because it was difficult to chew, the gravy looked like it had been out for too long and starting to curdle, and the extremely sweet candied carrots took up over a quarter of the plate, BUT the mashed potatoes were delicious.\n\nThe bf got the rack of ribs, which I got to try and that is the only reason this place gets two stars, because the whole night and all through the next day I had FOOD POISONING!!!!\n\nI wish I had listened to Renee S.' review and steered clear from this place...never again!
3 ||| I love Soul Kitchen at the Artisan Lounge!!!  The music was delicous if you're into soulful house.  The drinks are poured quite healthy there and the bartender was very  nice.  The motiff of Artisan is a bit Scooby Doo'ish to me.  The decor was a bit creepy as you walk into the hotel lobby and again in the lounge itself.  There are paintings of women whose eyes are \"looking\" at you and you just can't help but wonder if there are eyes that are really behind the paintings?  There is a wobbly ceiling fan at the end of the bar that looks like it would be in a Final Destination Movie. LOL....just don't sit there!   Tho this seems/sounds like a bad review, it's not!  Overall though.....it was a great place to chill, hangout with friends, meet new ones and gig to the music.  This place is definitely worth tweeting about and yelping....and that's a good thing!
1 ||| This place has kept my video tapes of my best friends' wedding (the only ones that exist) no one has ever seen them, and will not return them. Not only have they taken my money, they've locked their doors, disconnected their phones and there is no way to get the wedding video tapes back!  Clay Giroux is the owner of the business.  If anyone can help locate/contact him please help! Those tapes are precious and all I want is the tapes back.
4 ||| Great little barber shop, I've been to the flashy flat screen on every chair type of place but found I keep coming back to Beasley's. The  classic barber shop chairs and straight razor shaves remind you of what a barber shop should be.
4 ||| ULTA has won my heart, completely. I shop here frequently and every time I do, I get excellent customer service and the workers actually want to satisfy my needs. \nI visited ULTA today to hopefully change my eyebrow powder into a darker color since I dyed my hair black the day before. (I had golden light brown hair for two years) unfortunately I couldn't find my receipt for the eyebrow powder I bought earlier this year. (I was actually lazy to raid my room looking for the receipt) So the worker was generous enough to do an exchange for a darker color. There was a slight price difference of $2.70 but that's not much, right? I was completely satisfied. \nI also bought a Dolce and Gabbana perfume for the winter since my old perfume has a more floral scent and the worker who showed me it was so sweet as well! I am currently in love with the perfume. Love this place!!
2 ||| The atmosphere was pretty good for a pub, but the food was \"meh.\"  For an English pub the fish and chips were average at best. The service was very poor because they were too busy and had little staff. The waitress was overwhelmed, but was courteous and pleasant. Even though she was nice, we did not have our drinks refilled and were forgotten about for long periods of time.  The manager was very unaware of things that had to get done it seemed as he was busy moving tables, but not helping the wait staff fill drinks and assist with customers.
4 ||| I have decided that if I say anything about this place, more people will find out about it and it will be impossible to every get a seat. However if people don't  know how amazing the concept, food, and decor is, they might not go. What to do? fine.  This place is so good.  It is a regular stop on my brunch rotation.  Sundays get you an all you can brunch buffet.  The buffet consists of about 15 different salads and sides ( grape leaves, chickpeas, beans, Greek, to name a few.)  ALL COMPLETELY VEGETARIAN.  Then you also get to pick a main course.  They are creative, healthy and very tasty. About 5 choices.  Fantastic flavorful and so good for you.  I walk away gorged on food thinking, today I did something really good for my body. Its almost like a meal there is a cleanse and I always feel like a test start to my health.  And the includes the one simple detail I have failed to mention.  The buffet also includes unlimited cake.  Flavors unheard and familar. All bundt cake. All very very good. Usually 10 or so flavors at the same time to pick from.  It doesn't make the meal any less healthy.  It provides the same well rounded nature that life desires.  I love this place.  I really do.  So bring on the wait, cause this place deserves it.
4 ||| The \"Dillo\" is where it's at if you want a good meal and drink.  Plenty of TVs for sports and horse racing if that is your thing.  Excellent sports bar, friendly staff, good food, and did I mention the drinks?
4 ||| Very nice friendly service. Food very good and prices really reasonable. Big portions
3 ||| Great pizza joint! Cashier was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere is pretty 'Northern pizzeria.' Pizza has both visual and taste appeal.
1 ||| Dear Yelp,\n\nIf this is the best Mexican food that Henderson has to offer... Yikes!\n\nRead some reviews boasting about the California burrito here.  Being an avid fan of such burritos, I decided to head over and give it a try.  What I was given was not a California burrito though, it was a regular burrito minus beans and pico.  For those that have never taken a trip to San Diego, a California burrito must contain french fries.  No fries, no Cali burrito.\n\nSo after getting over the initial disappointment of no fries, I tore into Faustos (not really) Cali burrito.  The tortilla, which I consider to be the most underrated ingredient of the burrito, was actually pretty good.  Maybe they make it themselves?  Either way, a very solid tortilla.  Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing this burrito had going for it.  The slimy \"guacamole\" looked like the prepackaged junk you buy at Safeway (or Vons as they call it out here), there was too much sour cream, and the entire inside was cold as a dead piece of vagina!  However, I only dropped four bucks, so I can't really complain too much.\n\nAs it stands now, I'm thinking Rubio's really is the best burrito out here.  Like I said: yikes.\n\nI give Faustos Mexican Grill #2 a fantastic score of 2 out of 5 stars.\n\nLove,\nJames
3 ||| I've always been happy with Green Wasabi. One of my favorite sushi places.\n\nI love their special rolls. Who wouldn't want to order the Climax? \n\nTheir service is amazing. Their sashimi is one of the freshest I've tried. Mackerel is always fantastic. Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, it's all good.\n\nI love that they have drinks other than sake and beer and it never takes more than 15minutes to get your food. I've tried almost everything on the menu and there's not one complaint that comes to mind.\n\nKeep up the amazing work!
4 ||| We were out of town, but came here for our first \"ring shopping\" experience. Jennifer Powers approached us and gave us a lot of insight, was supremely friendly and exceedingly helpful. The jewels were exquisite, and even though we didn't purchase anything that day, we left with a much better idea of our options for a custom design. \n\nOur only regret is that we live 4 hours away, and cannot work as closely with them. You won't find a better service experience than Orr's.
3 ||| If you need a cheaper option to stay in Las Vegas, this is a good place to go.  While it's nothing to write home about, it still provides basic amenities and a basic continental breakfast.  The only thing I do NOT recommend is ordering their room service food.  The room service food is actually ran outside of the hotel, and is delivered through a different food company.  They were very late and also forgot half of our order.
0 ||| Horrible!! As a gift my parents got us a gift card to The Home Depot to help install new floors in our house. We called Home Depot to set up an appointment and the Home Depot advised that we needed to pay a fee to have the house measured. We set that up and paid the fee to get the area measured. We requested a quote for wood and tile, tile in the entry and kitchen and wood in the family room. We decided to do this and move forward with the flooring. Home Depot required 100% payment upfront. After about 5 weeks the day of the install comes.....6 hours late the installer tears out 50% of my old tile and informs us the measurements are wrong and we needed to pay additional for extra supplies and installation. We called Home Depot and complained, they said that they will take care of the extra installation for the portion that was not measured by them but we need to pay for the extra supplies. Home Depot told us that if we did not agree they would stop the work that I already paid 100% of and not take care of the extra installation that they missed leaving my house torn apart. The extra cost of the job is $400 on a $5,000 job and this is crazy!! We pay to have an area measured to get a job done that ends up being measured wrong and without any other option we get stuck with extra charges.
3 ||| Not bad at all... Hyatt Regency is basically a cookie cutter hotel, nothing extravagant or surprising really, but a solid place to stay. We had a king bed that seemed HUMONGOUS, it was wonderful and the room was nice and cool and got completely dark with the blinds closed. While this hotel is more geared towards the traveling businessmen, it was comfortable and after a good meal at The Compass Grill it felt amazing to stumble to our room and crash out in that wonderful bed. While there are some more romantic and elegant hotels around the Valley, if you need to be in Downtown Phoenix, the Hyatt Regency is pretty centralized and a good choice.
4 ||| Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\n\nThe three dinning rooms, \"outside,\" inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\n\nThe food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it.
0 ||| Comic Bowling... DJ's...Lasers... sounds like fun don't it??? Well I thought it was going to be fun, according to their website I was picturing a dark, glow in the dark bowling alley with lasers and loud blaring music and drinking.  Hmm Hmm.. Went to cosmic bowling with a group of friends. Well we get there right when comic bowling starts... They had shut down all the lanes and started a line of people to start getting everyone ready.  Right away I noticed the crowd of people..  not what I was expecting...There were a lot of kids out late at night and still jumping and running around, and when I say kids I mean 3,4 and 5 year old's.  Finally got our lane and I was expecting it to get really dark so we could enjoy the black lights..  Nope didn't really happen, it still stayed pretty light in the bowling alley, and the lasers sucked.. Then I started waiting for the DJ and loud music.. ummm no.. that didn't happen either... they had put on some really bad music video's that we couldn't even hear over the bowling balls rolling down, which was probably a blessing.  Then we go to the bar to pick up some pitchers of beers, not any good beers on tap and the ones they had were super expensive for this dive place.. We stayed cause we paid money to play.. We left around 1:30am, and the kids were still running around like crazy, I kept thinking to myself, what the F**k are all these kids doing up at this time... I won't be going back..
4 ||| A damn good, real burger!  Totally worth dropping in... great cheeseburger and the generous portion of fries had to be shared among 4 adults!
1 ||| The menu has remained basically the same since Baby Kay sold the restaurant late last year.  The food is not as good and it is my understanding the new owners dismissed Chef Lou-Lou, no wonder the food sucks. The restaurant is not as clean and the food is terrible. What a waste!!! If anyone knows of a real good Cajun restaurant let me know!
2 ||| Good Mexican food, but it is like sitting in a basement (no windows, no ambiance).  Food is solid though.  I would go back if I was in the area, but would not make a special trip.
1 ||| Let me give you some bullets of tonight's visit:\n\n*We asked for lemons twice in our water, but ultimately had to get them ourselves from the bar.\n\n*We waited 1 hour for our food. The waitress told us that the kitchen got slammed, but a large table that came in after us got served before us. Clearly, she forgot to input our order and then lied.\n\n*I ordered a burger medium-well, and it came out pretty much raw. When we showed it to the manager, his jaw nearly hit the floor. He could not believe that it was that pink in the middle.\n\n*We were never offered drink refills\n\n*Our table was never checked once we had food\n\nSorry, Goldies, but you have failed. \n\nI would say that if you are going here, just stick to beer.
3 ||| My first time at this restaurant for our 9th anniversary.  Sat us at a table next the windows, I had a great view, by husband didn't has there was a pillar in the way.  The table next to us, with a full great view, stayed vacant the entire time we were there.  I'm assuming they like to keep diners together.  \n\nMy halibut with laughing bird shrimp and peruvian purple potatoes was to die for, I ate the whole thing.  My husband was just okay with his veal cheeks, didn't care for the sauce and wished he had ordered the halibut too.  The dessert menu was very odd, we didn't order anything, but they brought us a little dessert that had \"Happy Anniversary\" stenciled on the plate, nice touch.
1 ||| The original owners are back with the OLD name Chicken Box, menu as changed.  It was empty when i arrived around 6 pm.  Half of the menu was handwritten and taped on the front of the registers, and some of the menus items were not listed but in the system (i.e kids plates, you have to ask.  I ordered chicken breast dinner with two sides and kids plate with one drum stick, i had to order another for a dollar, mac&cheese, onions rings are a side but extra.  It cost $17.00 (1 chicken breast/2 drums sticks.  It took approx. 25 minutes.  \n\nOne more thing I forgot..THE CHICKEN BREAST tasted like it was dropped into a bowl of SALT, very high sodium content.
3 ||| Why isn't there a Fazoli's in AZ!!?!?!?!?\n\nThere used to be and now they are all closed.  I wish they would come back. \n\nEvery time we come to Vegas, we have to make a trip to Fazoli's and eat as much food as we can.  The bread sticks, which are my favorite, are soft, buttery, garlicky, and have just the right amount of salt.  No matter what you order, red sauce, white sauce, pasta, pizza, their new flat bread sandwich-things...everything is super good!  The only thing I think they  could improve on are the salads.  You can tell they have been previous prepared and sitting in the fridge.\n\nEither way, it's fast Italian food...it's yummy!
2 ||| Great place to pull up to in your boat and get a drink on the deck and watch people navigate the traffic jam of finding a boat slip on a busy summer day. The food is ok. They market it as a Texas place and while the memorabilia decor inside is true Texan the food is only ok. All in all not a bad place to hang out on a summer day.
0 ||| Idiots cant cook a steak to save their lives. on my third visit I told the manager about my previous over cooked steaks before I ordered. My steak came out well done again. The manager delivered it to me personally. Idiots! If your going to post a \"cooking Legend\" on your menu to describe how your steak will be prepared maybe show it to the cooks first.
2 ||| It's a chain.\n\nThat is all.
1 ||| Not a great place for vegetarians. Cant comment on other foods.
2 ||| Hit or miss.  Trendy.  Service can be slow.  I used to come here years ago but haven't been in a while because I had one too many so so dining experiences.  I think there are better places for sushi in the valley.
0 ||| It's hard to find a good vet now days- one that shows compassion, one that follows up, one that is thorough in communication.\n\nMy family has been taking their cats here since I was a preteen- back when Krista (I think that's her name) was running the place. So, when I moved back to Arizona this is the first vet I decided to take my cat to see.\n\nMy cat has IBS and has for years and lately her symptoms have worsened and have been causing her severe pain. The new vet at Larkspur cat clinic saw my cat and he recommended two medications to ease her pain and inflammation.\n\nNow, when he gave me these medications he didn't mention any cautions or side effects. Didn't say to watch out for anything in particular- he just told me that they would help relax and ease the pain. So, I went home and I gave these medications to my cat. Within a couple hours she looked drugged up and out of it. She was acting quite strange and after 2 days she was very constipated and straining to the point that she was crying in pain. \n\nI decided to look up the medications prescribed and every single website I went to (and I went to a bunch) said that both medications are used in dogs- one of the dog medications was commonly administered to dogs in 17-23mg dosages- which my cat's dosage was 43mg (seems a bit high for a 6 pound feline), and the other medication had repeated warnings that it was controversial for cats and I read several times that is should NEVER be used on cats because it can cause constipation and blockages that can lead to disease and death, or something to that effect.\n\nAt this point I called the clinic and I explained my cats odd behavior and the constipation and straining. I also mentioned the medication and told them that I understand if there was a reason that the cat was given this type of medication, but was concerned because I read that there were side effects associated with this drug in cats and my cat was straining a lot and seemed out of it. \n\nThe woman told me the doctor was busy and couldn't take my call. So, I asked if he could please call me back before 4PM that day because I was very concerned about my cat (it was 9 AM when I called), . The woman literally... LITERALLY, snickered out loud, condescendingly, and snorted that the doctor was very busy and she'll 'see'... ~click~\n\nAnyhow, the vet NEVER called. Surprise!\n\nI have found a new vet- that so far has been very good to my cat. They follow up and check in and make sure my cat's symptoms aren't getting worse. I showed the new vet and the nurses the medication that I was given to administer to my cat. They were all shocked. First, one of the medications are these huge capsules- they are people sized. The first comment I heard was, \"I've never seen medication in that format... for a cat\". The other medication I was given were broken pills. Again- everyone was shocked by the format of the medication alone.\n\nThe new vet said she was unfamiliar with using the 2 medications on cats. I could tell she didn't want to say anything negative, so instead she told me to give  her a couple days to research the drugs and she'd let me know whether or not it was safe to give to my cat.\n\nA day and a half later I get a call from her. She says one of the meds is probably ok, but if the cat hasn't gotten better from it- don't give it to her. The other one- she said she didn't feel comfortable with me giving it to the cat and asked me not to. \n\nI will NEVER go back to Larkspur Cat Clinic. From giving me dangerous drugs (it seems like they buy what's on sale and give it out generically even if it's canine medication) that could kill my cat, no warning to the many possible side effects and complications to the dangerous dog medicine prescribed for my cat, then the horrific service- (Who condescendingly laughs at you when you are calling to say that your cat is having a bad reaction to the medication your doctor recently prescribed?) and then the fact that they NEVER called back- not to return my call, not to follow up, not to give further direction. I can't believe I paid $100 for this! They charged me almost $40 for the bad meds as well. \n\nI'm actually filing a complaint with the state board, and I told my family about what happened and we are all switching vets. I don't know what happened to this place, but it's not what it used to be.
1 ||| Stopped in for lunch & it will be the last time.  The food was very mediocre and  unattractive.  My husband had a hot roast beef sandwich & it was very bland. My salad was a little better.
1 ||| Came here for a seminar.  Surprised to see this place still exist as this location is very old and the hotel is in need of a remodel.  Good thing about Embassy Suites is that all their rooms are suite style and they offer free breakfast each day and free Happy Hour from 5pm - 7pm daily.  Not going back again until they remodel their looks.
4 ||| Place is beautiful! Wonderful view of the river and city! Staff is nice, but could be a little more attentive, at least in the case of my waiter. Myself & BF chose a salad starter (Caesar & wedge) and both were tasty. I ordered the cowboy ribeye which was accompanied by creamy mash potatoes. It was giant (16oz) & so yummy. My bf also ordered a steak, the ny strip, and his was smothered with an onion and mushroom based gravy, also great! My favorite dish however was dessert. We ordered the  chocolate truffle cake, basically a molten chocolate lava cake with French vanilla ice cream topped with Heath bar shavings. Holy moly so GOOD! That was definitely a great end to the evening. The bill was just a little over $100 for 2, but for what we got I thought it was a solid deal, and walked away fully satisfied ;-)
1 ||| I've only seen exceptionally bad service a few times and I usually consider it a fluke, but I'm not convinced this was the case.  8 person party was seated quickly, and 20 minutes later our order was taken. They brought out each of the 3 appetizers (which served 3 each) came out 20 minutes apart. Perhaps they thought everyone was sharing and wanted to space them out, whatevs.\nThe meals began coming out well over an hour after being seated. First wave was 2 orders of pad Thai, followed by a 15 minute wait until 3 orders of curry appeared. They let that chill for another 10 minutes before bringing out the vegan noodles (shared between 2). After 5 minutes we inquired about the final order (go see mee) and they said it took the longest because it was deep fried noodles. 5 more minutes passed before the final order appeared. \nFinal time from first order to last: 35 minutes.. Some people were done before the last entree was delivered, and no word of acknowledgement of the delay at all.
1 ||| I wasn't impressed with this place. I'm a Romanian girl who's fairly new to Arizona and when I heard about Europa Pastry Cafe I was totally excited to stop by and purchase cooking ingredients that I wasn't able to find the the local grocery store. The workers seemed very rude and the store was kind of dirty. Also, some of the prepackaged items were expired. I ended up leaving empty handed and very, very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend this place.
0 ||| One hour wait in line to rent a freakin' car. You're wasting my time. Incentive to never rent from them again! Bye Bye, Hertz. This was totally unreasonable and We had to rearrange our vacation itinerary because of their incompetence. The price wasn't even that reasonable-it was market value. Won't be renting from you again.
3 ||| Easily one of my favorite places in the Phoenix area to eat and drink. I've had a variety of their sandwiches and every one of them has been excellent. The Arizona chicken rolls are an appetizer that can't be missed. They have a wide variety of beers brewed in house so they are always fresh. The atmosphere is welcoming and energetic. This is a great place to catch a sporting event or bring larger groups. The venue usually plays host to a college town crowd and is usually busy but never overwhelming. Service is usually very good. If friends are visiting from out of town, this is where we will go every time. Four Peaks is a Phoenix area staple as far as I am concerned.
3 ||| Its hard for me to go to regular movie theaters after going to the AMC esplanade. Its hard to go back to coach after flying first class. This one is by my house and a lot cheaper though, so we decided to go here to watch Django. Its a nice big movie theater. There are a ton of restaurants nearby, so you can have a few drinks before hand and head to the movies. Just FYI. there is always a sewer smell out front.\nI have been here several times and usually have a good experience. Sometimes the audience members ruin it though, and that is very frustrating. I would blame it on the teenagers, but adults in this movie theater have been very bad too. \nWe like to get the refillable cups and bring them with us. Another fun thing is the different popcorn flavors you can add. It makes the popcorn pretty tasty.\nThey also have military/student/senior discounts, so thats great. \n\nI will definitely be back but Esplanade is my favorite.
2 ||| Nice little joint, nice little waiter, nice little waitress If only this were what we eat out for it would be a five star review.\n\nBut we do have to consider the food do we not?\n\nTomato soup with basil, good flavour but to course in texture.\n\nMeat loaf with mashed potato and mushroom gravy, Sounded good, was not good. I suspect the gravy was not made with a roux for thickening, but corn startch. It had the look and taste of a liquid clear plastic. If the potatos were real they found a batch that did a good job of playing the part of a boxed flake. The meat loaf had no discerning quality at all, so who knows if it was meat or tofu.\n\nThe iced tea was in a nice slender glass, but the flavour was of a nice tinted water. \n\nThe cookie was very flavourful with a good amount of chips inside. \n\nSo to say I enjoyed the food would be an untruth. Yes I will go back to try something else, just nothing with a sauce or gravy on it. \n\nI forgot I also got a side of beans. Again a very odd consistancy for the sauce in which they sat. Much too sugary with no other flavour.
2 ||| We use to go in all the time, and just put up with the bad service cause the food was ok and this place was close. I don't know if the guy with the bad fake hair is the owner or what but he always seems to wait on us. But he has the most miserable attitude I've ever seen! He just seems like he'd rather be somewhere far away. He takes our order and when he drops off either a drink or the food we always say 'thank you' but he NEVER responds with the 'you're welcome\" its just a 'uh huh\" really? That's the best you can do? We're your only customers right now and you make us feel like we're a bother to you? \nThe food itself is just ok, I do like the rice however, the chili rellanos are my preferred choice when we eat there, we've had other servers wait on us and they seem to be pleasant, far more than THAT guy....... We were going in on a regular basis but one time we had the worst service you can imagine, from the food on down, so we didn't go back for years and recently started going back. Not very often but from time to time and \"bad hair guy seems to have the same crappy pissed off I hate being here attitude\" . I'm really surprised they've stayed open as long as they have due to the little business they have,  every time we've gone in the most we've seen is MAYBE 5 tables at one time , the service was a 2 star at most the food was 4 stars but that's it... it never changes..\nI think we'll have to take a break from this place for a while and see if things get better... there are better places than El Burrito, it's just nice cause it's close...
4 ||| I love this place I went here with a living social. I love old fashion feel places. This is def a phx jem! I had a fancy soda and ice cream basically a amazing soda cream drink that tasted like a pie! I love their uniforms here too reminded me of a serendipity :)
0 ||| Legally, it may be able to be called custard, but if you serve it from a regular soft serve machine, it will have just as much air whipped into it as regular ice cream.... Then, what's the point? \n\nIf you know HOW frozen custard should feel, then you will be disappointed with Luv It. \n\nToo cheap to invest in a Ross or Stoetling = too cheap to get any of my money.\n\nAdditional info after owner replied...\n\nThe owner replied about the FDA, etc. Yes, I am VERY aware of the legal requirements to call it \"frozen custard\" thanks to Andy's Frozen Custard's incredible advertising (10% milkfat, 1.4% egg yolk solids) however, overrun (the amount of air mixed into the product during the freezing process) is not regulated, as far as I know. The machines that Andy's used when they opened were Ross freezers and (as anyone from southwest Missouri who has ever heard \"Hi! I'm Andy\" on the radio knows) \"making machines that don't whip in extra air is no problem, they just cost an extra $20,000\".\n\nThe first question I ask when visiting an unfamiliar establishment is \"What brand of machine are you using?\" (in fact, the owner of Sheridan's immediately said \"Where are you from in Missouri?\" when I asked him the same question before they had opened. This was right around the time that Stoetling bought out Ross, IIRC.)\n\nIf it's a Ross, Stoetling, or a custom machine built by them, then the owners know frozen custard. Those machines produce a very sllllooooowwww output of product that usually slides down a chute into a freezer.\n\nIt is impossible to fill a cone \"soft serve style\" because a true frozen custard machine produces a \"log\" four or so inches wide and about 2 inches thick. It then enters a bucket in an external freezer and requires hand scooping. \n\nFrozen Custard from a place like Andy's, Sheridan's, Ted Drewe's, or Freddy's has a VASTLY different mouth feel\n\nWhen we visited Luv-It after we first moved out here in 1999, I believe they were using the standard Electro-Freeze machines. It was EXTREMELY disappointing to get frozen custard that felt like standard regular soft serve. The flavor was fine, but it was no better than other soft serve.\n\nAs I stated, legally, I have no doubt this product qualifies as \"frozen custard\". It would be foolhardy to advertise it as such and not be able to prove it. That is not my issue with Luv-It.\n\nPerhaps they replaced all of their machines in the ensuing years. (It appears from Yelp photos that they may have.) The rudeness of the \"dude\" running the window and the disappointing product caused us never to return.\n\nI may give them another shot.
2 ||| Nice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.\n\nI do like this place.  It must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  Like smoking, sitting and texting.  I'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the \"to do\" list because there is no where else togo really....\n\nWhy didn't they answer me at the drive through? I think they wanted me to come inside because my girlfriend and I are really really really good looking.\n\nThis was annoying but understandable.
0 ||| CLOSED?! Wow, this must have just happened because I was just there 2 weeks ago.\n\nBut, regardless, it was terrible. The service was flat out BAD -- I was ignored for 5 minutes while 4 employees dicked around by the fryers.\n\nWe ordered two chicken bowls and an order of potstickers to share.\n\nThe potstickers looked like deep fried testes. We asked them to redo them when they initially served us these shriveled little balls that had melted wax paper stuck to them because they put them in the bag when it was covered in hot grease. They brought them back raw, but dripping in grease. I actually said to the girl behind the counter, \"You've got to be kidding me.\"\n\nThe rice was mushy, the teriyaki sauce was ICE cold, the chicken was dry, and the mixed vegetables were just a bunch of greasy bok choy and limp carrots.\n\nThis was a favorite place to go in San Diego and the first one we'd tried in Vegas since moving here last year.\n\nTotally, inexcusably awful. If it really is closed, it's good riddance.
0 ||| My leather did not last at all. It is only my husband and myself and in less than 2 years the leather looks so worn I need to replace it. Contacted this store and although they sent someone out to make sure the leather wasn't defective, I was treated very rudely, told me people that complain about the quality of furniture normally do not have the funds or are unwilling to take care of the furniture properly.
4 ||| Always on the look out for a good pizza and after reading the reviews on this place I decided to give it a whirl. \n\nBeing by myself tonight I ordered an Italian Sub. Damn good meat great bread and they toast the subs and put the veggies on cold! I love that.  \n\nReading the reviews about the sauce I asked for a side and it was amazing. Great sweet tomatoes, some oregano some garlic, onions bazil and something I just couldnt place. If I had guess I would say honey. \n\nI cant wait till I can talk the girls into giving the pizza a try.
0 ||| Won't be going back....my sister who usually cuts my hair saw how bad of a job it was. A hair person herself, pointed out the simple little things.....won't be going back plain n simple.
1 ||| Love their fried chicken drumstick over rice. Best choice for a take out. But if you dine in, they have lots of decent dishes to choose from. I was there yesterday with some friends. My last visit was quite some time back and so yesterday I was shocked at how the portion of each dish we ordered had shrinked! They used to serve you much bigger portion! Times are really bad! However, there's still quality in their food. Just not the service level. The employees are not exactly making you feel welcome at all. They just want to chase you out right after you finish eating.\nWell I can't really blame them cos the place is quite small. I won't stay long right after I eat especially when I know there's ppl queuing for tables. \n\nAnother thing I don't like their one rice per dish thingy. We are a group of 4 adults ordering 3 dishes plus an appetizer so we will only get 3 bowls of rice and have to pay extra for one more. Who sets this stupid rule??? It really got me offended when I first learnt about it. \n\nYes, their 3cup chicken may be good, but now I've learnt to cook my own after I found a really good recipe from online. Will not be visiting this place often...
4 ||| Kaila's teeth are just about perfect.
4 ||| me WUVS this place!\ngreat food, great service..... \n\ntheir sake steamed clams r awesome if ur a fan of the clam!!!\n\ni heard their ramen is good too..... but haven't had the chance.\n\nbeen here about 3 times and can't wait 2 go back.  there is nothing i've had that i didn't like.  o yea..... and the shrimp lettuce appetizer..... mmmHmmmmMmmm............ pad thai.........uh huh.\n\napparently japanese do italian very well and i'm interested in the chicken marsala.\n\nsrsly..... ne place that serves soft shell crabs is A+ in my book.
1 ||| Please note that I went to The Shoe Shop to repair two leather jackets-so I can't speak to their shoe repair services.\n\nI had two leather jackets with tears on them. One down a seam and the other on the arm(not on a seam). The gentleman that helped us was very short and rushed when quoting us a price. After being a bit flustered and agreeing to the $80 for both jackets to be repaired, we left. He told us we should expect to have our jackets fixed a week from when we dropped them off.\n\nThree days later we got the call that the jackets were done. (Which was a plus as the turnaround time was quicker than originally quoted). When I picked up the jackets the lady behind the counter was much nicer and more accommodating than the man that helped us when we dropped them off.\n\nShe brought our jackets out in a plastic trash bag and I looked them over to see the repair. The jacket with the tear on the seam looked to be repaired well, yet the stitching used to fix the tear was black, while all other stitching on the jacket was tan. I brought this to her attention and she asked if I wanted to send it back to be redone. I told her no, as I wasn't very thrilled with the idea of another interaction at the shop. The jacket with the tear on the arm looks to have been glued, and the tear (now glued back together) looks to be bigger than it was when I dropped it off.\n\nFor $80.00 I would have expected more. Maybe this shop is better at shoe repair than leather repair. \n\nDisappointed overall.
4 ||| NoSheen is always beautiful & ready to answer any question you have about the shop & Marcel always seems to bring back stuff from Indonesia (& elsewhere I presume) that I genuinely luv.\n\nPeople always ask where I get my 'unusual' apparel.  If its not from NY, it's probably from here...\n\nIt's very easy for me to walk in look around at mother of pearl, silver jewelry and clothing.\n\n...then leave with $200+ less in my pocket. \n\nGo here.\n\nShop.\n\nSee for yourself.
2 ||| Zenith serves the kind of food that your non-vegetarian, culinarily inept friend might make for you. You smile and choke it down because you don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's just bad. Some noodles, ground up tofu and sauce from a can equals lasagna. The \"chickpea burger\" I foolishly ordered today appeared to be about a half pound of dry, hummus-like mush, grilled a while beforehand and served cold on a cheap, untoasted white bun. I couldn't bring myself to eat it.\nTwo stars only because the salads are okay, and what vegan doesn't get excited about a table full of vegan cakes?! Mind you, the cakes aren't that great (tend to be a bit on the dry side), but there's a lot of them! My advice if you go for Sunday brunch: skip the entr\u00e9e.\nI really want to like Zenith. I love the concept, and they all seem like nice folks who mean well, but they really need to work on their recipe development.
4 ||| This is my hot dog heaven.  I have been coming here for years only for their Whooli's Jumbo dog with chili, cheddar cheese, and lots and lots of onions.  It's sad that this is the only thing I get, the owner, Guy, knows that's the only thing I order.  He's determined to get me to try something else, but how can I say no to so much deliciousness?  \n\nThe place has moved from their original spot, and I quite enjoy the new place. The bar is a lot bigger, and they have a few tv's located around the restaurant for you to watch a game while waiting for your take out.  I love the little detail at the bar that they have their little Irish man ironed/burned (?) into the wood of the bar.  Small details like that are nice.  The place has a homey feel that you're just chilling with friends.  Some of the tables there are picnic tables, so I like that.  \n\nThe atmosphere is friendly, but sometimes it felt like it can get a little too loud.  But everyone is just there for a good time, so no hard feelings.  There's is also a pool table located there which you can test your skills at.  \n\nTry this place out if you're looking for a nice relaxing bar to wind down at for the end of the day!
0 ||| I cannot believe this place is an actual Marriott property and not a Courtyard or Springhill Suites, which is the designation I think it truly deserves. The pictures on Marriott's website are particularly deceptive for this hotel. The quality of accommodation, service level & amenities is sub par.\n\nThe hotel itself is an okay property. The lobby is nice & the rooms are acceptable however the pool area is small and sparse and the room windows are not nearly thick enough. The hotel is unfortunately located next to the airport so all day long there is the sound of airplanes and they cheaply did not use the right thickness of windows to block the noise. The service I received was disappointing, and as a Platinum Marriott member I have come to expect more. The lady who checked us in was curt and barely looked at us while checking in. She tried to put us in a room that was less nice than what I had reserved and paid for, and I had to ask for room upgrades (none available...first time that's ever happened to me) & my complimentary breakfast (no concierge lounge on the property) - basically she was not going to offer to me what I deserved. In general the people working at the restaurant were unfriendly.  The place is overpriced for what it is. \n\nAlso whoever designed the hotel did a poor job of situating the rooms & hotel areas to take in the great beauty of the surroundings. Thirty seconds in a car away from the hotel & it's gorgeous, but none of that can really be seen or appreciated from the hotel which is a shame. I will never return to this property and would rather stay at a different hotel in the same area.
1 ||| The breakfast items are a little bland, i.e. bagel sandwiches and breakfast burritos. This place is always busy though, so I assume the rest of the items on the menu are really good. Staff is nice, if a little slow sometimes.
0 ||| I normally get my breakfast burrito from Salsitas on Central, but decided to give this place a shot as I've read some fantastic reviews... Unfortunately, their ham, cheese, and egg burrito left much to be desired. I love drenching my burrito in salsa and their salsa had little flavor, taste, or spice. The burrito was large, but 90% of it was ham with little egg or cheese.. and about halfway through I bit into an eggshell. Save yourself a $1 and drive a mile down the road for better taste all-around if you're looking for a bomb breakfast burrito.
3 ||| i went awhile without nails since i moved and was having some trouble finding a place that i really liked( yes us women get attached to our nail tech so its hard moving on to someone new). No complaints. Quick service, decent prices. lots of pedicure chairs also. 100's of nail art designs to choose from if your into spunking up your nails(which i am) ...  glad i gave this place a shot since i had mixed emotions based on other reviews... goes to show ya only really can judge for yourself!
3 ||| Nice upscale-casual place in the heart of downtown Champaign. Their menu varies, but just tonight I tried a couple of tapas (fried mozzarella and calamari) and the mushroom ravioli. All were delicious and well presented.\n\nMy warm chocolate cake dessert, however, tasted soggy and generally unpleasant. It came with a scoop of some oddly flavored ice cream---I think it was meant to be mint, but it tasted more like horseradish. Not the best way to end a dinner; fortunately the rest of the meal was good enough to make up for it.\n\nOur server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job. But overall service in the restaurant felt slightly slow, even on this quiet Monday night when my party was one of only two or three in the entire restaurant for a whole two hours. Halfway through our meal I noticed a middle-aged woman abruptly exit the restaurant despite pleas from her waiter. There was no commotion: it appeared the customer left, after settling down but before ordering, simply to protest the service speed.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I'd add that the men's restroom was a little worn and unkempt in the details for a restaurant of this caliber. The lock was also broken. Holistically, though, I had a great dining experience here.\n\nQuick tip to first-time diners: Free parking is kitty-corner to the restaurant in a third-party lot. Spaces numbered 1 through 30 are reserved for this restaurant's patrons.
2 ||| You may have heard recently that curling is all the rage since the Winter Olympics came through.  Some call it \"chess on ice\", but that may not be completely accurate, since chess is a little more precise in the placement of pieces.  Maybe \"shuffleboard on ice\" is a little more accurate.  Either way, the game (sport, whatever) is definitely entertaining.\n\nThe Charlotte Centre Curling Club is open for membership, and they just held their first Learn to Curl event at the Pineville Ice House.  About twenty intrepid souls, plus a few instructors and even local \"celebrity\" Larry Sprinkle, checked out the action and tried to figure out the game.\n\nPlayed on ice, with droplets of water sprinkled on top to create a rougher surface which \"curls\" the 42-pound granite rocks, players try valiantly to maintain their balance while pushing the rocks back and forth, using sweeping techniques to get the rocks to go where they want (the sweeping action creates a path of sorts for the rocks).\n\nMost of the session was spent figuring out how to keep your balance and push the rock towards the other end of the ice.  Yours truly spent a good bit of time on the ice.  The one time I managed to get the rock moving in the right direction, Larry Sprinkle was sweeping a bit too vigorously and he ended up on his backside.  Another, I didn't even make it that far and nearly took out the camera.  I hope I don't get a bill.  Or sued for nearly killing a local celebrity.\n\nApparently the feature will be shown on April 9th.  Have to keep an eye out for it.\n\nAt least for a limited time, the highlight video is online - complete with a shot of yours truly knocking Larry Sprinkle to the ice.\n\nhttp://www.wcnc.com/on-tv/Larry-learns-that-curling-is-year-round-90346659.html
4 ||| I don't know how many years I have been going to SONY, and I have never been disappointed. Sandwiches, pizzas, beverages are all delicious, have a great appearance and the prices are right. Love the people working there.
4 ||| This is the coolest place in the valley.They have the best variety if you are a hiphop head, hippy, or headbanger they have the gear for you. It's like First Friday everdyday in this store. If you decide to sell anything make sure you are patient and just enjoy the view.
0 ||| Not good. Don't think I'll be coming back here. Food is overpriced for the quality. The beef is slimy. And the wait staff doesn't pay attention.
0 ||| I got into Madison pretty late due to a delayed flight.  It was getting pretty late and I just wanted something to eat after checking into  my hotel room.  They had an ad in the hotel directory so I ordered from them for delivery.  I know, I know, I should have checked Yelp first.\n1) They were \"out\" of thin crust.  Umm, yeah weird but ok.   I'm tired and hungry so I'll go for their usual \"pan style\"\n2) They took over an hour to deliver from 3 blocks away\n3) The pizza was truly gross.  I should have just gotten something from a gas station or something.  It was not good pizza.
4 ||| Great Pizza & Fries.  This is old school and we have been going here since 1997.  We take everyone we know to Angie & Jimmie's and they walk away saying the same thing.  Great Pizza !
0 ||| Very disappointing.  Was so looking forward to trying this place based on the reviews.   No one was in the place when we came in.   It is In serious need of updating and maybe the health inspector.   We sat in one of the larger tables and the server brought us water which he spilled and then moved us to a different table. We were only allowed to order from a menu in the wall which was basic Asian.  We all ordered the chicken pad thai which was BORING and Bland.  No spice at all.   The broth noodle soup was strange and not necessary.   Never ever go here.   It needs to close.  I don't know where the other reviews ate but it sure wasn't here.
3 ||| Best option for Indian food in the Valley...had the Biryani which was delicious, and came with a ton of meat for a decent price...not to mention some excellent sauces. I hear the buffet is the way-to-go, but have yet to try it.
2 ||| What is there to say about a fast food pizza place? It's fine. Villa Pizza is just like Sbarro, you can get pre-made, crappy slices of pizza. You order, they throw it in the oven and warm it over for you. Nothing great but a decent snack if you happen to be in Green Valley Ranch casino. They have some meal deals on their menu board where you can get pasta and a salad for less than $10.
0 ||| I called this location to order a pizza for delivery. I was staying at the La Quinta down the street. I received a message stating this location had been closed. They did provide two other locations and numbers for their other locations that could assist me. I did call one of their other stores, I am writing a review for that store separately. \n\nI am only giving it 1 star due to it being closed (why rate my past experiences at this location now).
4 ||| First and foremost, the one huge downside to this place is that almost everything is really reallllly overpriced.  That's the only reason I can't give 5 stars.\n\nThat being said, I always like to stop in here and look around.  They've got some really neat stuff, and I find that they sometimes get some new products in before the big box stores.  I always bring a lunch to work or school with me so I'm always looking for good, durable, and leak-proof containers and this place has tons of them.  They have the absolute best lunchbox soup containers.  \n\nBut mostly I wanted to review this place because there's a young girl who works here who is always super helpful and friendly.  And even if I don't buy much here I'm always willing to come back because they have really good customer service.
3 ||| Food is great. Chips a lil salty but a lot of food for great price. Server was very friendly
1 ||| Pike's was always the place we went to grab onion rings and a milkshake, and it's still a great place to go do that.  The problem with this Pike's location is that they have a full menu that they don't seem able to deliver.  The last time i went i was quickly served my milkshake, but I left after waiting 25 minutes for my food (the waitress never came by and there was no one else eating at the restaurant).  The last time my parents went they said the food was ok, but that when they were brought their food originally both of their meals were wrong.
3 ||| let me preface by first saying that i have never had salvadorian food before so therefore i do not know what good salvadorian food tastes like, or is supposed to taste like, so this review is strictly from my american palette and what i think tastes \"good\".\n\nwe arrived around 6pm on this wednesday evening and there was only one other couple in the entire place. dead. crickets chirping. it's rather odd inside. somewhat tacky and cheap, but i wasn't expecting a fine dining meal. \n\nwe went with the iced tea (spicy!) and the ensalada drink (refreshing!). got the appetizer platter with the meat pie, pupusa, rice, beans, and tamale. the tamale was rather soggy, and the chunks of chicken inside were large chunks and just kind of awkward. the meat pie was cheesey and delicious as was the pupusa. and the rice..well, i could eat that rice every single day! buttery and fluffy is how i'd describe it. for entrees i chose the camaron and carne fajitas and my girlfriend chose the chicken with rice and salad. hers was delicious, mine was meh. it came loaded with onions and the tails were still on the shrimp. the tortillas were different, to say the least, really thick and doughy, i didn't care for them too much.\n\noverall, the food is very bland. i don't know if that's a characteristic of salvadoran food, but i like my food with a bit of a kick or spice to it.
1 ||| Walked into the store and ordered 14\" Deep Dish, Meatballs, two Cannoli and a can of Dr. Pepper. No other customers were there and the phone wasn't ringing off the hook from what I could tell. \n\nAs I waited, I heard the register girl laughing in the back, \"They said they wanted to speak to the manager. I told them I WAS the manager. Ha ha ha.\" That should have been a red flag. \n\nThe order was ready in a half hour and I took it to my car. I asked my wife to check for the Dr. Pepper. It was missing. SO I went in and got it. \n\nWhen we got home, we ate the pizza and meatballs. Both were good. But when we reached for dessert, we found out that they gave us cheese cake instead of cannoli. We were really looking forward to the cannolli. How hard is it to get an order right when nobody else is in the store? I may order pizza from them again but I'll make sure to check EVERYTHING. Can't stand incompetence or indifference.
0 ||| The worst cleaners I have ever gone to by a long shot. If there were a way to give it negative stars I would. I'm in AZ often (family) and brought a few shirts there the first time I used them. Came back with wrinkles in them but the guy behind the counter told me it was \"normal\" (staff have horrible attitudes here). I had to have them re-done somewhere else. Brought a comforter and a suit jacket in two weeks later thinking maybe they just had a bad day the first time. Nope. Both came back looking like they'd barely done anything to them. Stopped going there after that.  \n\nBut that was nothing compared to how my mother was treated here. They shrunk one of her fancy dresses and she brought it back. They took the dress and told her that the owner would be calling her to resolve the issue. Never called. She went in five times over the next two months and just got the same story over and over. \"The owner will call you.\" Nothing. The owner hides behind his employees and does not deserve your business. They do terrible work and when they damaged her dress not only did they not stand behind their work they took the dress and never returned any phone calls or addressed the problem. If you look at the other Yelp reviews there are numerous people here who had the same experience. Ruined clothes, phone calls that never get returned and a company that does not stand behind their work. Buyer beware....
4 ||| This is where I get my Korean Hawaiian plate fix.  Love the veggies that come with the meal, so Ono and the soup.  Saimin is awesome too.
4 ||| I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.\n\nThoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well.\n\nChicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)
4 ||| From the front office to the quality of dental care, this place is perfect. My boyfriend started going there, then I did. We even switched our son over from his pediatric dentist to go here because they are so gentle, clean and professional. I have also had some dental issues in the past and they actually were able to give me OPTIONS to correct them, not just telling me what to do. I have never had a choice in decision making in my dental care. When I went in when I was pregnant, I let them know the taste of mint made me nauseous and they easily accommodated me. We have never felt ridiculed or scolded here, which is a common issue with dentists.\nIf I move to Sun City some day, I will still make the drive to this office. This is my forever dentist.
4 ||| We've been to this location a couple of times now and each time we are lured in by all of the nice items that they have and wonderful decorating ideas they offer. We love to browse through here and debate how we will decorate our house when we buy one.  \n\nBoth times we have been here we can tell that the staff isn't really all that interested in helping us out. We've been greeted, but that's about as far as it's gone.  Unfortunately we've gotten some pretty judgmental looks and vibes off the staff here, which is not the case at the others we have gone to around the rest of the greater Phoenix area. \n\nThe setup and feel of the place is very much like other locations - very rustic and charming with a little bit of modern to keep it relevant to the times.  I love all of their holiday / seasonal items and the new nautical line they offer is really nicely done!\n\nOverall: B-\nWhen we do end up purchasing bigger ticket items, once we are settled into a house, it most likely won't be from this location...
4 ||| Absolutely fantastic, the best money we've ever spent! Chris, Roberto and Fred were wonderful to deal with, very quick to respond to my initial inquiry and within 10 days from start to finish, our 12-yr. old leather couch and loveseat are back, looking just like new. Both pieces had several worn spots and, scratches (many from cats!) and even a tear, but you'd never know it to see them now. Customer service is excellent - Chris explained the repair process in detail, and they did just what they said they would do. Pricing seemed more than reasonable to us, and even the loaner couch we were given was very nice. It's very rare for  our expectations to be met in terms of quality of work and customer service when dealing with service companies, but Leather Like New far exceeded them with their professionalism and craftsmanship. I can't recommend them highly enough! Many, many thanks guys!!
4 ||| As a current student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I can say that I cannot imagine my life without experiencing the UW. This school was just recently ranked the 41st best university in the world. The academics, wide range of courses and talented professors encourage students to succeed. There is \"something for everyone\" at this school. Here is a list of unique opportunities that students at this school are offered...\n1. Camp Randall and Badger Football\n2. Bascom Hill\n3. State Street\n4. Greek Life\n5. Huge, lively campus\n6. Wide variety of students\n7. Thousands of student organizations (go to the Student Org Fair!)\n8. Kohl Center\n9. Free workout facilities\n10. University Health Services\n11. The gorgeous lake\n12. Memorial Union Terrace\n13. Union South (bowling, rock climbing, who could ask for more?!)\n14. Hundreds of internships offered in the Madison area\n15. Constant political activity\n\nStudents attending this University are offered so many opportunities that the average college student does not. If wondering where to attend college, strongly consider Madison. It is an unbelievable college town.
3 ||| This tea station pales in comparison to the one in San Gabriel Valley. I don't know why, but it's lacking totally on the flavor of the taro snow ice with boba. Still a great drink, but not the mind blowing milkshake I had at my first Tea Station experience in LA. The environment is a lacking too, but when I'm just here to pick up a drink and bounce, I am not too concerned about that.
1 ||| BBQ was really dry and the tea was pretty stale tasting. Only part of the meal I enjoyed was the buttered biscuits. Cheap though.
1 ||| Overstock of large birds with behavioral issues. Poor feather conditions. Generally dirty and large, beautiful birds are waiting to lure you close to try to bite you. On any walk through, I usually can't find more than 2 that I can handle without issues. Many smaller birds are kept in fish tanks like hamsters and they fear hands. many items are overpriced and when asked why they were selling expired dried bugs I was told why not the birds will still eat them? Six months later the same expired Bag'o Bugs were still out for sale.\n\nStaff will answer questions if you ask. They usually will not ask you what you need.\n\nThis is not the only bird store in Mesa.
1 ||| The food tasted fine, but the portions were mighty small. I had over medium eggs and biscuits. The wait was not worth the food, that's for sure. Nothing memorable to keep me coming back.
0 ||| Ordered hot corned beef and wife ordered a cheeseburger at 230pm. We were the only ones in the place.\n\nI asked to please wait to make the corned beef until the cheeseburger was ready.  Ok, no problem.   Paid the $21 and went to a table.  Within 2 minutes, the corned beef arrived.  I asked for the 2 meals to come together, young lady.\n\n\"Don't worry, your order will be right out.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, it came.  Corned beef was dry and tasteless, cheeseburger ok for eight bucks.\n\nI agree with another review, this place is just an overpriced sandwich shop with bad service. Not sure what is special here, if anything.
0 ||| I've eaten here several times over the last couple of years for business lunches.   While the service is usually OK, the food has always been mediocre.    Today was the worst, though.  A friend and I ordered a glass of Glenlivet, neat (no rocks).   They served us something that was so watered-down it was unrecognizable.  The servers insisted there was no water added, and then the manager got involved and said the same thing.  Their arguments were insulting--the stuff was probably 50% water, no question about it.   Luckily all the lunches I've had at this place have been paid-for by someone else.  I wouldn't give a dime to this place when they rip you off with watered-down drinks and so-so food.
3 ||| People, I have finally found an amazing Chinese joint here in Vegas!  Who would have thought that it was going to be in Chinatown on Spring Mountain! LOL. This place got great reviews from my Elite friend, Jessica P.  Here's what we got:\n\nBeef Chow Fun in Soy Sauce for $9.95.  Really flavorful, love the chow fun noodles, super soft with green onions.\n\nCrispy Salt and Pepper Pork Chops for $10.95.  They said it was hot but it's not as hot as I thought.  There were jalapenos and red peppers.  This was AH-MAZE-ING.  The pork chops were perfectly cooked, batter was crispy and nice marbelized ratio.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT DISH.  \n\nGeneral Chow Chicken for $10.95.  Lots of flavor, great batter, included carrots and peas.  The sauce was a little too salty for me but if you like oyster, soy and other sauces combined, get this dish.\n\nCrispy Fried Lemon Chicken for $10.95.  People, I have FINALLY found the perfect lemon chicken dish in Vegas.  The chicken was crispy, the lemon sauce was perfectly made and this dish made my meal!  \n\nCrispy Fried Dungeness Crab with Salt and Pepper for MKT PRICE.  PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU CONFIRM THEIR PRICE.  We kept asking the server the price and it sounds like she was saying $6.95 and we kept asking her, however it turned out to be $16.95 and threw us for a loop when the check came.  I did like how they brought out the live crab in a bucket before cooking it.  It was juicy, crispy and perfectly flavored.   \n\nThe place has a lot of stuff going on.  To me, the typical Chinese restaurant, full of Chiness decor and statues.  Round tables, only thing missing is a lazy Susan LOL.  They even ask if you want an ocean view seat, which is in front of a big fish tank.  The staff is on it.  They always refilled our drinks when the glass was 75% full.  I think that our little misunderstanding of the crab price was the only thing that I did not enjoy.  The staff kinda got a little impatient with us but other than that, I WILL BE BACK!
4 ||| Took a little trip to Roman's a couple of weeks ago to drink a few beers and listen to music.  If you are going, get there early because the drink prices go way up at 9pm.  We have been a couple of other times and always have fun.  You will see all sorts of people there and everyone seems to get along.  The food and drinks are good and so is the service and music.  Worth making a visit if you can.
0 ||| No Service! Turns out the hours posted are not their hours of service. I dropped a large object on my foot and was pretty sure it was broken so I looked online and saw their hours are 8-5. \n\nI arrived at the clinic at 4:23, told the person at the front desk what happened, and she told me the xray tech was leaving at 4:30 so all I could do was see a doctor. When I told her that didn't help me, that I would most definitely need xrays, she said the xray tech left at 4:30, as if I didn't hear her the 1st time. \n\nI asked if she would talk with the doctor to ask if I could see the tech first, she then said it would take me more than 7 minutes to fill out the paperwork and that I wouldn't have time to see anyone before 4:30. Apparently, the front desk person, who, based on her grammar has less than a high school diploma, makes office decisions, not a competent office manager or the highly educated and trained doctors. Needless to say, I left without seeing a doctor or getting xrays. I did suggest that they post their hours as 8-4:30 or they actually provide all services until the closing time. \n\nWe've all been to businesses who stay late to accommodate the customer, you would think a health care provider would do the same, especially if the patient is in the office prior to the posted hours of service. Concentra apparently does not accommodate the patient, just the hours of their non-customer service oriented staff. Good to know, there are other Urgent Care facilities available, now I know this is not one that I care to go back to.
4 ||| canneloni! fresh spinach raviolis! Italian sausage, their recipe!\nNot so sure any fancy Italian restaurant can top their deli food.
1 ||| I'm really disappointed in this location.  The last two times I've been here they haven't had the kind of meat I wanted ready.\n\nThis Thursday night at 9:20 they didn't have any steak for my burrito.  The guy said it would be ready in about eight minutes.  I told him I'd come back another time and walked out.\n\nThis Saturday at 11:30 AM I was in and asked the order taker for chicken tacos.  We both looked at the container that should have had chicken and it was empty.  The lady said it would be about 4 minutes until it was ready.\n\nI waited and got my tacos and they were good.\n\nI think I'll give them a while to get their act together here before I come back.
4 ||| Our favorite place in Pittsburgh for Thai food! Service is excellent!!! We're kind of regulars now and we always get lucky to be served by this white guy who is awesome and polite. Their food is a little expensive but its so good. Try their tum yum veggie soup!!!! My favorite!
0 ||| Updated 8/15/2008 \n\nThis place used to be the best but it has gone down hill terribly while the prices remained very high.\n\nThey used to have the freshest fish and now they have some really foul tasting tuna and salmon which has gotten me sick. They advertise their salmon as King Salomon but it really just tastes like raw canned salmon. As I'm a big fan of good Salmon, this will stop me from ever going back.\n\nService has gotten pretty bad also. The new waitress they have was about absent minded as can be.\n\nThe only things I still like at Shimogamo are the live sweet shrimp (ama ebi) and Sea urchin (Uni) but on the live sweet shrimp they have gotten very stingy as they only give you one head and they split the body in 2 pieces.\n\nThe establishment stank like rotten cabbage and I've noticed it being not well maintained behind the sushi bar. Another annoyance is that they are only open for lunch on Fridays now.\n\nThere are much better options around and at this momemnt Sushi Kee 3 blocks east on Warner (at Rural) is a lot better.
4 ||| One of the best massages I've ever received! I saw all the positive reviews and had to see for myself... and YES, they are TRUE! Susie has strong hands and knows how to make you feel relaxed and leave de-stressed! She's been a masseuse for 17 years. I'm already thinking of when I could go back...if you are in town, must see Susie!\n\nThank you for the rockin' massage!!
4 ||| I have had nothing but enjoyable experiences at Comic Oasis and I thought it hight time I shared that with you.\nLet's start with a staff that was friendly and engaging not just with me, but my children as well. Whether via telephone, or in person I have had only pleasant dealings with the crew at Comic Oasis.\nSelection is very good and easily accessible for your Wednesday fix, they've even gone to the trouble of posting each week's releases in a handy spot so you can peek and see if there's anything you might've missed! Trades and other collections are represented well at the store with mini-shops devoted to some of the industry's top drawing characters. My kids enjoy flipping through the sizable poster selection.\nIf you have a nerdy special occasion coming think about one Comic Oasis' many statues and maquettes! Seriously, they have more of these things than I've ever seen in a storefront before. \nTo sum up, my tip is to budget an extra twenty before you go because, if you're like me(and I hope for your sake, you're not)you will end up spending that too.
0 ||| Aaahhh, nothing much, especially for the prices.  Eaten here twice, don't anymore because the food isn't that good for the price.
4 ||| Great selection of model home furniture.  Arranged in very fashionable settings.  Pieces to match any budget, I only with my budget was bigger..
4 ||| I've been coming to this place since I was a little girl. You can't beat the lunch specials here!! The only thing they are missing is a patio and happy hour! \n\nTry the lasagna and the manicotti! This lasagna is seriously one of the best I've ever had!!! I don't know what it is about the simple garden salad here but it's amazing!! I also love the antipasti salad!! The garlic parmesan bread that they give out with the meals is mouthwatering and worth going in just for that alone!  The menu is pretty large so you have several options to feed your craving. The portions are great for sharing but also great for one person who's decently hungry. \n\nThe building has a small bar that can seat about 7 but the dining area is split in two which is great if you want to have a large party. They have both booths and tables which are both very comfortable. You can always count on seeing off duty officers or local firefighters enjoying a meal here (always makes me feel safe).\n\nThe staff here is always friendly and I always have a enjoyable visit.
4 ||| Love Pei Wei.  Just tasty, ALWAYS.  \n\nThis location is very easy to get to and cool that you can take it all to go.\n\nService has been pretty good every time I have gone here.
1 ||| Not from AZ but decided on a business trip to get my nails done. Have to say we know how to do nails better in CA than AZ, sorry. They are QUICK. Felt like my mani/pedi was not done very well. After finishing my manicure I noticed there was still cuticles that needed to be trimmed. Overall it was not the best mani/pedi I've had.
1 ||| I go here all the time since its the closest store to where I live.  That being said, their prices are not great, the store is VERY run down, and their produce is worse than Walmart.  With so many good Fry's grocery stores close by - why do I always end up here?!\nI do want to mention the customer service isn't bad.  Just not the place you wanna bring your wife and little baby to...
4 ||| Love it! glad to see them open and in business!!  great to for a late night!!
0 ||| One day I walked in and noticed the cook sitting in the dinning area, while I waited to order I notice him dig in his nose, then walk back to the kitchen and didnt wash his hands, I wasnt sure so I walked around to the kitchen to peek in and I was right...I then told the owner and his wife and they made him wash his hands. I walked out....will not be back.
3 ||| Let me start by saying that this struck me as a very white-washed mexican food restaurant. In other words, intended for the typical white American who is unfamiliar with quality mexican faire.\n\nI appreciated the provision of chips and salsa, and the gentleman who brought them was VERY considerate and kind to have brought individual salsa cups for each of the five of us.\n\nBut it was like pulling teeth to get more.\n\nI ordered the pork taquitos from the appetizer menu. $6.25 for six cigarette sized items that were undoubtedly frozen ten minutes prior.\n\nThe items that others at the table ordered appeared to be tasty, and one fellow patron literally cleared the plate.\n\nIf I were in the area with out of town guests who wanted mexican, and they were not well versed in the faire, I'd take them here.\n\nOtherwise we'd go elsewhere.
3 ||| As far as casino hotels go, this one isn't the best and surprisingly the majority of the hooter's girls here aren't even that special or sexy.\n\nI keep coming back for the guaranteed 24/7 $3 blackjack tables that are always fun for me to play at.  I swear I could play for days on end if people don't pry me away.
3 ||| Good service. Not that high on the food.
0 ||| DON'T DO IT . . .\n\nThis Quality Inn is anything but quality. Rooms are TINY. . Internet does not work. AT ALL and they have 4 different routers. When you ask the front desk about it they tell you to try to reach one of the other motels internets or maybe Mc Donalds. Told them nicely that it was bad, the said \"You've not stayed here before\".  \n\nRooms were very small and not ready when we arrived at 6 PM at night.  Chair at desk had broken casters, explained to managment about it, wasn't taken care of.  When I went to shower the second night there I opened the shower towel to dry off and it looked like it had been used to polish shoes.  After speaking to three fellow co-workers about the experence, they stated that thier towels were the same way . . .  \n\nI guess it all hotels in the local area were booked and I had to work in the area again . . .  I'd stay again if I didnt' have a sleeping bag for my truck.
4 ||| Great alternative to Starbucks. I like the seating and the location. Usually less busy than the Starbucks across the way too. \n\nCoffee is good and strong.
0 ||| Been here 1month. Tried for 1 mth to see our floor plan but they never got it cleaned. Said too many others rented & they came first. Misunderstanding of the non-refundable dog deposit, which happens but Elana ARGUED with us over how she was right, we were wrong. Really nice landscaping but apts really need work inside. FP tile cracked, nail polish on bathroom counter but worst is rusty, soap scummy shower door. Should have been replaced. You can really hear upstairs neighbors walking. And now cockroaches! I called for service and was told lock my dogs in a room for 8 hrs as they had no idea when it would occur. Elana said could do nothing about that. I emailed home office which did give me a 4 hr window. I know cockroaches happen BUT GROSS.  If Pinnacle was priced about $100-150 less a month I'd say it was worth it. But for $1000 a month it's not. I can put up with a lot, like bad customer service, but not cockroaches. I'll update next month to see where we are with the critters
0 ||| Employee wasn't overly helpful or friendly.\n\nBummed they don't do any gluten free.  Got a couple cookies for my girls.  They thought they were just okay... and didn't finish them.
4 ||| I feel bad that I haven't written this review sooner...the manager really deserves some recognition. \n\nI have celiac which requires me to order gluten free food. Pei Wei provides quality gluten free options and though the gf menu is rather small, I'm always satisfied. \n\nA couple months ago, my little sister and I decided to call ahead to get take out. When we arrived we were told it would be about 10 minutes.\nI'm perfectly used to waiting longer for gluten free food. I understand that it takes a couple minutes longer because the cooks have to change their gloves, change pots and pans to prevent cross contamination ect ect. So we waited maybe a minute or two over ten minutes and I really couldn't have cared less. However the manager was so very apologetic for the delay explaining that they had to remake mine because it got contaminated. Hey I'm perfectly willing to wait a couple extra minutes to not get poisoned!! I told him everything was fine and he proceeded to give me a $10 gift card just for the short delay. I didn't even make a peep about waiting and yet he made it clear that he cared and we were important and that means a lot! \nI wish I had asked his name but I didn't :( so if you ever read this sir, thank you! \n\nAnd about the food...yeah it's awesome. I love the sweet and sour combo (chicken and shrimp) on white rice or the spicy chicken!
1 ||| After reading the reviews I decided to stop by and I was a little disappointed, not as good as all the reviews suggested.
1 ||| We went there to attend a meeting with our clients, I ordered a eggplant parmisan... another co-worker ordered the same, he started eating before I did... I was about to eat and he whispered it to me, dont eat the eggplant is raw, it can make us sick... i stopped and examined and i observed the same. Anyways our clients were happy with what they ordered. We decided to proceed with our meeting and discussing work and not make a big deal about it. I did not eat all and just had my lemonade.\n\nNext instance, it was my son's first birthday and we thought of having a dinner party, although RMG was never our first priority, my wife still decided to at least give them a call and ask them about party menu and other arrangements. They were the most expensive and totally INflexible. They said we could not make any changes to menu blah blah. We said thank you and proceeded with Olive Garden Happy valley.
2 ||| Was in town for company training and a coworker recommended this place.  I highly recommend making reservations as with any izakaya it gets busy.  Arrived only to be disappointed that they didn't have suzume.  Ordered a bottle of something else which wasn't as good.  On to the food, we ordered a bunch of stuff along with the typical yakitori stuff.  The food was good but nothing really wow'ed me.  It may have been the fact that I just simply wasn't hungry.  We did make the mistake of having a few drinks and appetizers at a restaurant inside the MGM.  We definitely ordered too much food as we had leftovers.  Did however try their honey toast which again was good but nothing spectacular.\n\nWill have to go back to try again.
3 ||| If you want a sit-down restaurant for a quick lunch, this is a good place to head. They have some nice (and different) sandwich and salad options including a turkey and brie sandwich and a \"biltmore\" salad with blue cheese, corn, and baked chicken. \n\nMy biggest gripe is that they keep changing suppliers for their food! My husband and I tend to head here before the movies maybe about once a month. They seem to really have the food down...and then they change it up (have seen this on everything from fries to tortilla chips.) \n\nAlso, if you are looking for a quiet lunch, don't go during a sports game! This place gets pretty noisy with the 20+ TVs going and the fans cheering.
0 ||| This confirms my opinion that restaurants that claim to have a great view rarely have good food but are always overpriced.  This one is also old and run down.
4 ||| A Sunnyslope landmark and I am not exaggerating. This place has been here for as long as I can remember and the service has remained top notch. I have bought and sold a few bikes here over the years and have never been done wrong. Bought a bike today and was impressed with the fact that the guy didn't even try to up sell me at all. He gave me suggestions based off what I said I was looking for,let me try a few bikes out in the parking lot and when I chose my new ride proceeded to make adjustments to the handle bars and seat which magically made the bike fit me like a glove. This is truly a great place to buy a bike, support local businesses and honest businesses by buying here.
2 ||| A pick up with many items missing.  Including tortillas for tortillas for fajitas.  Would of been excellent but couldn't drive all the way back for tortillas n sour cream defeats reason we had it pick up
1 ||| I read some positive reviews so I thought if try this place. Arrived at 4:30 to find them closed. Although posted hours are 9-5. Less than stellar first impression.
4 ||| This place is top notch. The service is impeccable, the food is great and always fresh and the bread...mmmmm the bread, so good.  The best around.\n\nThe service is good, people are nice especially considering this place is a zoo 24/7.  There is always a smile on their face and always happy to accommodate, which is hard to come by nowadays.
4 ||| Went here yesterday for dinner. Had the pork chops, red beans, mac n cheese, and corn bread. \n\nCorn bread was soft and delicious. \nPork chop was thin and had enough seasoning on it for me. \n\nOverall I was pretty happy with my selection. The waitress was friendly and I'd go here again.
3 ||| I haven't played here, but I have used the practice range a handful of times.  I prefer Karsten, but it's a bit pricey for a bucket of balls so I come here when I'm on the cheap.  The staff isn't the friendliest here and the practice range is an afterthought, but it's a good place to work on your game every once in a while.
0 ||| Five stars?  Eek.  \n\nI dont wanna get all highbrow here, but prospective diners probably shouldnt harbor illusions about a place charging $7 for a couple of chicken fried \"steaks\" big enough to flop over the edge of the plate.  \n\nNeither of us finished our cow patties and we both felt a little sick afterwards. Not violently ill or anything, just that bloated, greasy feeling culminating in a concise bout of diarrhea.  \n\nThe service is ok and it's cheap, but in terms of food quality, there are half a dozen better restaurants within a hundred yards of this place - seven if you count Taco Bell.
0 ||| I was outraged when I stopped here , the cashier took 10 minutes to figure out the previous order and when she was asked to ring an item up she said \"really\". I lost patience and left this establishment  .
4 ||| I've been coming here for about a year now and I haven't stopped coming ever since. Frank is the guy to see!! He's consistent and has never let me down. If looking for a barber or barbershop, this is your place.
1 ||| There bathroom Is nasty!  Really Dillards!\n\nI like Dillards, but this bathroom.....OMG, I felt like I was in the  Walmart bathroom!\n\nThey have some good sales going on right now 50% off.
3 ||| Went for happy hour, service was great drinks were good, but the food was SO SO.. Prices were very reasonable, atmosphere is nice. These folks are new to the happy hour game perhaps they will catch up! We are rooting for them because they have a great patio and wonderful owners.
3 ||| Good place to hang out after your evening shift, or bar closings.  Don't bother too much with anything other than breakfast, which is not the greatest, but consistent and filling.  In other words, fill the void and don't expect parsley or anchovies on your ceasar salad.
0 ||| ICK--avoid this place.  I took one bite of the sushi and stopped eating it.  It tasted funny and waaaaaay fishy.  Our chef wasn't Asian but some white guy who didn't knock my socks off.  All he did was toss some high sodium sauce on some veggies and meat, stir them around, and serve them on our plates.  My stomach hurt less than 1 hour after I ate there...'nuff said.
3 ||| About $8 a sandwich.  A little out of the way.  The philly cheese steak was good.  As always, I threw in peppers.  Yum.
4 ||| It was great to find a New York / Jewish style Deli in the middle of Phoenix on my last trip out there.  Miracle Mile doesn't hold back on their servings and prices albeit a tad high, is well worth it.  You can't go wrong with the 3-D Sandwich Combo, it has Corned Beef, Pastrami, and Roast Beef.  Ask them to toss in some thousand island and sauerkraut.  I beleive they have multiple locations, so google or yelp them!
3 ||| Papa Murphys is by far my favorite of the chain pizza available in Las Vegas. I always get the DeLite crust, as it reheats much better than the thicker crusts. You get to pick your toppings, and they have a bunch to choose from. The sauce is good, and the toppings always taste fresh. \n\nLook online for coupons before you go. The website always has some, and there is usually one for the DeLite crust. You can call ahead, but it usually only takes a few minutes if you go in to order.\n\nThe reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they always seem to be out of something. One time, it was the DeLite crust. They stretched the regular crust out instead. They have been out of bacon at least twice while I was there, and various other toppings at one point or another.\n\nBut if you are looking for a cheap, tasty pizza and don't mind cooking it yourself, go to Papa Murphys.
3 ||| After spending last fall and this spring trying desperately to eradicate a mysterious green invasive plant in my yard, I recently ripped a chunk by the roots, go in my car and went to The Bruce Company.  They have a plant help desk there (near the back of the main garden center) which is staffed by \"know it all\" experts!  After a few moments of rolling this green nemesis through his fingers he told me it was wild oregano....what?!  He said it's very invasive (which I knew), and walked me over to their  magical potions aisle, handed me a bottle of Bonide brand chemicals and sent me home to spray on the newly identified horror.  Within two days this green mess was a beautiful shade of wilted brown!!!  Sure The Bruce Company isn't the cheapest greenhouse in town, but you get what you pay for.,,I'd spend at least $100 on other products trying to kill this weed that was taking over my grass...and had I got over to Bruce's earlier, this $18 bottle of chemical would have cured the mess!  \n\nOutstanding service, expert staff, and they even offer a return policy!  Go to Middleton and buy local!!!!!
4 ||| Boyfriend doesn't get the hype about Trader Joes. Why have us Hawaiians deemed this an omiyage must-stop when in the southwest? He gets that for those who live nearby it's a great stop on the way home from work and agrees their prepared meals look good. But as a gift shop??\n\nO M G! Because they have the widest assortment of Americanized yummies ever! It's like Wholesale Unlimited for mainlander tastes! Organic snacks, nuts in every conceivable form, crackers n cookies made from healthy sounding ingredients that look and taste scrumptious. And plain old evil delectables with an interactive twist.\n\nWe didn't stop there on our recent jaunt (dislike!) but Son and DiL did. They brought over one of TJs new (at least to me) delectables - S'Mashing S'Mores. D R E A M Y ... C R E A M Y sweet goodness. Picture a graham cracker with a honkin' marshmallow all double - triple? - dipped in rich chocolate. \n\nWhat makes this piece of heaven sing is its interactivity component. Label instructions suggest nuking your cookie for 4 - 6 seconds. This is when the magic starts! I  recommend eating this Shanhai Dumpling style. Take a small bite off the outer layer and start slurping out the delicious center. Soooooo good!\n\nService has been consistently pleasant since I started shopping at these markets way back in the early 90's. Assortment and prices are amazing. My recommendation to newbies...make the stop and don't forget the S'Mashing S'Mores!
0 ||| Dr. Rimoldi is the very worst doctor I have ever experienced in my life. He is a spiteful powermad egotist who will shut you down, and TELL YOU what is what. Never had such a pitiful excuse for a doctor in my life...and his staff is worse. Filing a complaint with my insurance company as we speak. Don't even think about seeing this inhuman uncaring egotist!  You've been warned....I would hit -5 five stars if I could!
4 ||| My new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas/ Henderson area. This place has a bowl alley , arcade and a movie theater for the kids. Room were very clean . Customer service was fantastic.  Sport book was a great place to kick off week 1 of Nfl season
1 ||| This location is so slow. I went here a couple weeks ago with over 30 minutes to spare before class and ended up barely making it. Orders were taken slowly because cashiers chit-chatted for way too long. And the barista (I think her name started with an M) was taking her sweet ol' time. Employees here need to be retrained and put through some speed/efficiency tests.
4 ||| This Wendy's is the best one in the area. Normally I don't eat at Wendy's but this place is right next to my work and is so convenient. But there are plenty of food places bear here so if it wasn't good, I really don't HAVE to go there. I go because the food is always great, their salads are fresh the chicken is cooked perfectly. The workers are wonderful. Tammy is amazing and helpful. I definitely recommend this Wendy's if you're looking for something quick and yummy.
0 ||| I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. Went there for pickup and the waitress was EXTREMELY rude!! Acted like I was wasting her time, didn't say hello or goodbye, just kind of left us standing there awkwardly after she handed us the reciept. The food was very overpriced for what you get (got the felafel dinner) and the felafel was very dry. Don't go here!
0 ||| Um. . .No.  \n\nHonestly, I'm in a major snit about this place.  I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:  \n\nFirst off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?  \n\nMajor issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.\n\nMy food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the \"from your grocer's freezer\" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.\n\nOur spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place.
3 ||| My new boots (men's) fell apart while I was in Vegas recently.  Based on Yelp reviews and where I was staying I took them to this shop.  They did a good job and were able to complete the work the same day, the day before a holiday.  Pricing seemed fair (I don't think I even paid extra for the same day work).
4 ||| 4 1/2 stars actually...\n\nI really enjoyed Rokerij. Our server David was fantastic, and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner, the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.\n\nRokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my \"vodka surprise\" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)\n\nI ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.\n\nI would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar, we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!
3 ||| Love this location. Have never had any issues other than a stench one time. Easy fix, move to the other side of the restraunt.
4 ||| I had a wonderful experience here the other day. I was in and out in 2 hours. I wasn't treated any differently because I have no insurance. I was seen by Dr Healey and she gave me the attention I needed and listened to everything I had to say. And knew exactly what was wrong with me. Gave me a lot of info and even referred me to a doctor because I'm new here and wanted to help me. Another doctor came in to check me out and he was also wonderful. Made me feel comfortable. No complaints from me about this hospital. Just because it's a county hospital doesn't automatically make it have bad employees. Good hospital, I'd give it more stars if I could
2 ||| I had been looking for some good bbq brisket. I had the brisket, collard greens and red beans and rice, with unsweetened apple blossom tea. The meal was good but the brisket was leaner than I am used to. I like the fat that is on one side, gives the meat a extra flavor. I could taste a slight smoke flavor but seasoning was kind of boring. They had some bottled seasoning called magic dust that added some flavor but I liked it better on the potatoe salad my fiance had than on the meat. Side portions were alittle small but the meat portion was ample. It came with a dinner roll and extra cornbread muffins were .49 cents. I would have liked if the muffins came with all the meals standard. or give an option for roll or muffin. All in all it was good but not great. Maybe next time I will try baby back ribs...It was just ok...not finger licking outstanding. We shareda  slice of pecan pie. It was good, sweet, we wanted warm and got a microwaved warm piece of pie. the center was cold, I will have to say the potato salad, tea (which comes in huge mason jars), and pie were my favorites. My fiance got the catfish, which was one big fillet, he said is good but I did not try. He loves the corn muffins and tea. On second thought, I may not go back for another visit and continue my quest to another joint.
2 ||| UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.
1 ||| Prices were cheap however food was served well after others who came in and they literally put Brown gravy on the Mexican food, staff ignored simple requests...only reason for 1 star was due to price
0 ||| This is the \"steakhouse\" at Palace Station. More like a regurgitation of their crappy coffee shop chow, in a slighly more appealing atmosphere.\n\nFOOD: The worst orange roughy I have ever tasted... mushy, soggy and repulsive. Dry pork chop, bland creamed spinach. Stale, old looking items on the salad bar. \n\nSERVICE: Our waiter was poorly trained and indifferent.  He did not even know the difference between Bouillabaise and Ciopinno.\n\nOne star for the good bread basket (pretty hard to screw up store-bought bread). \n\nDon't bother.
4 ||| Wow what a delicious and Fresh!! Place! I'm going back!
4 ||| The Heard Museum is truly awesome. It's not huge, but they make the most of their space, including short films, longer presentations, and a huge display of kachinas in telling the cultural stories of Southwestern Native Americans. Importantly realizing that Native American cultures are not dead, the museum contains modern artwork and filmed interviews with members of today's Native American tribes. The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.\n\nOne could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. \n\nA final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world \"beautiful\" to describe any building in Phoenix. It resembles images I've seen of Roman villas and its courtyard is very mellow, with a nice cafe and pools of running water. I would even recommend coming just to chill out with an ice tea in a stunning courtyard. I mean, where else can you find that in this town?
2 ||| They get the job done
3 ||| I eat here for lunch about twice a week. The menu is so varied it's hard to get tired of the place. I recommend the manager's special which is a cup of soup and any half of sandwhich. My Fav is the New York Yankee but I get mine grilled. A half a yankee is more than enough, it is a robust NY deli style sandwhich packed high with pastrami and corned beef. My favorite soup is the tortilla which is awesome but on the right cold day the chili all the way works too.
0 ||| Apparently, you really do get what you pay for.\nMy mother and I went to get our nails done for a night out. While hers came out perfectly fine, the man who did my nails probably didn't care about hygiene. Or safety. Or being professional or courteous. \n\nFirst, he started scraping my cuticles with his own nails. I let that go since it's happened to me in Mexico but I don't like it when it happens.\nHowever, the final straw was when he cut me- twice. On two separate fingers. Not even a little cut, which would be acceptable, but one was bleeding enough that the little bowl of water that you put your hand in was colored red. I jerked my hand away so that he could see what he did but all he muttered was a \"tsk tsk\" and kept going. Instead of listening to my gut instinct and saying \"you know, I don't want the manicure anymore\" I just stuck it out. \n\nI really wanted to like this place since it is so cheap ($8 for a manicure!!) but I will not go back. If the lady had done my nails then it would be a different story. \n\nI would file a complaint with the AZ cosmetology board, not because I am one of those who complain, but because this really was a bad cut. However, you need before and after photos and I do not have those since I don't expect to get my cuticles ripped out when I go get a manicure.
1 ||| if you don't want to read the review here is the shortcut: food was wonderful, everything else was disappointing. \nBrought my mother-in-law for a brunch here with a plan to indulge, try as much of the new menu as possible, get her spoiled, get her pampered...as she deserves :) We have started sampling right away with 2 different specialty cocktails, moved to 2 different appetizers and 2 different entrees ... obviously we were there to stay for a while and to really enjoy. Food wonderful, service OK.... we were just starting to contemplate a sweet finish when the bomb arrived: \"Here is your check ladies!\"... we have literally just put our silverware down and the check was there already without anybody checking if there is anything else we might consider... I was so surprised that all I can say was...\"well, I would still like at least a coffee\". Purposefully I gave the waiter my CC right away (to the bill that he so promptly brought)... wondering how are they going to handle the \"additional cup of coffee\". The  waiter came and started to pour coffee to my mother-in-law, she stopped him, clarifying that she did not order any. My cup was filled... and again very shortly after  - to my surprise  - a new bill arrived (I have to admit I was totally expecting to have the cup of coffee complimentary -  after I have expressed my surprise of an early bill arrival) - well I was surprised even more when there were 2 coffees charge to my bill. I have decided to just go with it - payed my bill and left. \nAlso the new decor though very sleek and elegant, but can be found in any other new modern hotel (Westin style) - not reflecting the historical & cozy feel - that Royal Palms as a AZ landmark so uniquely represented. Multiple shades of brown and beige, no other color (remember the signature orange walls and the map on the wall in the bar with libraries filled with old books  -  making it one of my favorite spots in PHX - gone).  The only nice touch are iron wall dividers filled with candles and the \"smoking room\" still holds the \"old charm\". The bar enlarged (good move), but very mundane again - nothing to remind you that you are in one of AZ oldest mansions.... just another dark wood elegant bar you can find in any new elegant hotel.
4 ||| Been here a few times and every time the food is just great.  Keep trying new things and never disappointed.  Service is good and of course so are the drinks.\n\nBig time sports bar with TV's everywhere you look, so if you are looking for a quiet meal this isn't the place, but if your looking for a lively time or wanting to watch the game with good food and drinks this is the place.
0 ||| Absolutely awful! Do NOT go to this doctor's office! I was a patient for only 2 months before I decided to leave. The front office is completely rude, especially one woman in particular. For example, I had routine blood work done and received a call for my results while I was at work. At lunch I called and immediately the woman responded rudely and degradingly asked 'what test results are you talking about!?' it's like she shouted at me! I never saw any of the physcians besides the PA, which was fine, but as a new patient and from someone who actually does work in a doctor's office, you should see a physician first, not a PA. \n\nJust recently, I requested my medical records to switch over to a new PCP and had to cancel 2 appointments with my new doctor, due to the lack of timely response to get my records released to my new doctor from AFC. It was such a hassle, I had to keep calling to ensure that they were released. At the end of it all, it took them 2 months to release only 3 PAGES OF RECORDS!!!\n\nI would stay away from this location, it is not worth the time and effort and lack of respect they show their patients.
0 ||| This drive thru pharmacy needs a lesson in customer delight. \n\n1) They are slow\n2) often incorrect and have to re-do\n3) They really don't understand the lifetime value of happy cutover\n4) their voice calling system - doesn't leave name of person the prescription is ready for, so you are left guessing\n\n\nThis manager should start to take time at learning \"window lessons\" from the other drive thurs (dunkin donut, macdonalds etc) and train their people on make customers feel wanted.
3 ||| 3.5 stars, actually. Would be 4 but I had to knock off half a star because of the parking situation. The lot sucks, I used to work at Whole Foods and I can not recall how many times I almost got hit by a car when retrieving carts. I am one of the lucky ones, I know of a few people who weren't so lucky. \n\nI'm a huge fan of the salad and hot bar - not a fan of the price though. To be fair, I can only blame myself for ending up with an $11 salad (but everything is so good and actually fresh I can't stop myself from piling it on). The prepared sandwich's are pretty awesome too and if you go after 9p, they are buy 1 get 1. \n\nI now work with a lot of children on special diets and I have no problem finding lots of GFCF treats for them here. \n\nGroceries range from expensive to moderate depending on the brand. The WFM's 365 line is an excellent bargain. \n\nThe bakery is full of tasty treats. You've gotta try the pumpkin pumpkin pie, though I believe it is only available around the holidays. \n\nThe whole store gets crazy busy on and around holidays.
3 ||| If I'm correct, this is the open restaurant in the middle of the small mall in Chinatown. It's kind of an odd setup. Anyway, I think you'll want to skip this one and go ahead and eat at Sam Woo BBQ in the same plaza. The plates had traces of oil and I spotted a few dried up particles of food in the bowls. The food was just ok. I can't really remember what I had, which might be saying something...I do recall some tasty string beans and nice servers.
4 ||| FANTASTIC Teppan Steak and Sushi.\n\nThere isn't much more that I can say that others haven't. This place is clean and friendly, good atmosphere, the prices are...well...sushi prices.\n\nThe Teppan table is a show in itself, the steak and calamari are both outstanding, but the sushi bar is wonderful as well.\n\nOrder yourself a sake bomber and a Tempura roll--best sushi roll on any menu I have ever had. It is essentially a Philly roll that has been tempura battered and flash fried, then drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. The thing is practically a dessert, you must try it.
3 ||| I work for the same company as the first reviewer and this week it was my department's turn to volunteering at St. Mary's. This was actually my third time volunteering for the organization as it is an annual event for my team. In prior years I haven't been into volunteering because I was basically an ass and didn't see the benefit in it for me. Personally, the past six months have seen some really good highs as well as some very bad lows, but I met people who helped change my perspective on helping people and giving back to the community.  And even though it should be a year-round thought and not only be about this time of year, the need is more visible during the holidays. Knowing that people are struggling and seeing the good this organization does for people really does make a difference. With my family back East and just me here in Arizona I don't participate in the holidays, but spending time volunteering or supporting local charities is a great way to give to those who are in need and I have discovered the good feeling it brings.\n\nThe first reviewer provided good quantitative data on the number of hungry children and adults living in the country today. With 3 grandparents still living, I am sensitive to the needs of our seniors and the struggles they face with heating bills and medication taking money away from food expenditures. Another thing that impressed me with St. Mary's is that it was the country's first food bank, founded back in 1967.\n\nA difference this year in comparison to my first experience with St. Mary's is the impact the economic downturn has had on families. Due to increased unemployment, cutbacks in jobs, rising bills and other concerns, many more people are facing hunger this year than ever before. That puts extra pressure on organizations such as St. Mary's to meet the demand, and that is accomplished in part to volunteers such as you and me. We were told that last year they served more than 65 million pounds of food - enough for 300,000 meals per day - do Arizonans alone. With unemployment continuing to increase, that number is sure to be higher this year. The volunteer staff member told us that the emergency bags they assemble, which is for people who just lost a job or are in immediate need and not yet in the system have seen an increase of 400% this year.\n\nMy group today totaled about 60 people and we filled boxes for 2 hours. When you volunteer, the cool thing is the volunteer staff member will total how much food the group assembled and how many people it helped. With our work today, she said we bagged 6800 lbs of potatoes, 2230 of the emergency food bags (which she said would be gone by this evening) and 15,200 lbs of prepared food boxes (550 boxes on 22 palettes). All total for the day, the grand total with prepared boxes and food bags, she said would be enough to feed 35,200 people. Granted we had a big group, but for just 2 hours of help, that is a big difference. The sad thing is with the number of people coming in for assistance, that food will be gone in a couple of days.\n\nI would encourage everyone to take some time out of the schedule and help out. A little bit does go a long way and those recipients greatly appreciate what they receive.
1 ||| I went to eat here tonight because they sent me a buy one get one free meal coupon, how can i resist??? \n\nSo we get seated, this guy comes to order our drinks and we both ask for water....he never came back, then another guy asks for our drink order and guess what.. he never comes back! we ordered freakin water for christs sake! So then this lady comes over get our drink order and she brings us some water. finally ahhhh. i was dying of dehydration! its a desert out there u kno!!!!!!\n  \nthen we order out food, it came out pretty quickly and the corn was kinda overcooked and mushy but other then that i cant really complain too much. we paid and went to go walk over to the bar.\n\nso serious pet peeve, people who sit at the bar where there are games and do not play... if u r going to sit there than play or sit at a seat with no machine. Of course it is full of people not playing and i cant even get a seat. annoyed i left. \n\nthis review is one bad experience but i want to say i have had 4 star experiences at this place but this was my first time in their restraunt section.. that part gets 2 stars!!
4 ||| My favorite sushi spot.  Great food and atmoshpere.
1 ||| l eat here weekly the place is clean and people are  friendly  food is absolutly delicious but i just dont know why everytime the price is different.i got exactly same Sandwich everytime but different employees charges different,  the prices have gradually increased from $7 toal most$10 i wish everytime they charge the same Price.
3 ||| Very cool old place in the industrial part of town.  I wish it wasn't surrounded by two strip clubs (made for interesting conversation with young kids) but the food was pretty good, not greasy at all.
2 ||| Tons of crap in this place. I felt like everything they sold was overpriced. A freaking t shirt was $20. I passed that up. No tshirts for anyone!! I walked around and around until I settled on those giant ass pens. It is something that I can use for $1.99. \n\nIf you come in with a large bag, just remember to park you ass at the entrance and give it up to the front door lady, who will give you a number for your bag for when you come back and fetch it. Because since it is the largest store of crap, people tend to pocket that scorpion necklace or the fake barf.
3 ||| I am so happy I found a place like this on the east side. It kinda reminds me of LGO but more accessible and spacious, I have found parking close by every time. I'm a sucker for downtown areas and rebuilt old buildings that are also well designed (the bathrooms are a must-see) and I love all the natural lighting from the big windows. It's been a little too chilly to sit on the patio, but it's tucked away from the road a bit, so I bet you'll find me there come springtime. \n\nI keep coming back for the latte bowl. It's fantastic and stays hot for like an hour. We had a pizza last week which was really good, but yesterday ordered the breakfast quesadilla and although it was humongous (enough for two), it was kinda greasy on the inside. Everything else I have had has been really good though. \n\nI am totally looking forward to the Espresso 101 and 102 classes I keep hearing about. I also want to try their other restaurant \"Joes BBQ\" across the street. I've heard good things about that place too.
3 ||| My opinion of this chain keep dropping-seems like every time I visit one the wait is just really long,whether it be the wait to place your order (this is usually the case) or the wait to get your food.\nThis location of some reason, smells like farts and really bad. Inside and out. I had to leave to regain my appetite. My daughter kept making fart jokes because of it, which was amusing.\nSeems like the prices keep going up too,at all of these.\nI guess the two redeeming qualities was the service and the quality are still good.
1 ||| While the decor and people of Pane Bianco are certainly of the chic and cool crowd of downtown Phoenix, AZ, the food is lacking in quality and excelling in its price.  The bike rack out front, for the latest hipster's recently purchased 10-speed, is a nice addition to the patio seating however, the food served could have used about a $3.00-$4.00 discount in pricing.  \n\nI was with a group of eight people, of whom i am out to eat lunch with on weekdays and weekends and, all of us had never been to Pane Bianco.  I ordered the Tuna Sandwich, while others in our group ordered the Mozzarella Sandwich.  We all agreed that the the food was somewhat tasty however, it certainly didn't match the pricing or even the over-self-assured staff.  The decor inside seemed nice however, out of place in Phoenix, AZ, as it was resembling a Kansas-Linen look, with a hollow and ghost-like feeling of emptiness, no matter how many people were there.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend Pane Bianco to those who care about a good ratio of the quality and price of the food, unless you have a $10.00 and $5.00 bill burning out of your purse or pocket, and are equipped with an equally snobby attitude, a thick un-Phoenix-like beard or, can still fit into your size 2 skinny jeans and Jackie-O sunglasses.  All in all, this is a place for blowhards and posers, not for the price conscious educated palate of most of the Phoenix area restaurant visitors.
4 ||| We came here for lunch on a Saturday with Pitt playing on Saturday and the Steelers on Sunday. Arrived at about 1:30 PM without a reservation and were quickly seated. Fabulous views from just about anywhere in the dining room. \n\nI had the five mushroom soup and it was delicious! Very fresh, lots of mushrooms, very rich. I also had a small salad and it was fresh mixed greens with a good balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nThe others in our party had the crab cake sandwiches. I was thinking, \"Crab cakes in Pittsburgh???\" They were huge, (about 8 oz.), all lump crab meat, and everyone raved about them. All agreed they were the best crab cakes they had ever had (and these are some real crab cake snobs!). So if you go to the Grandview Saloon, get the crab cakes! Service was efficient. I would definitely go back.\n\nTake the Duquesne Incline  from Carson Street (free parking), turn left out of the incline terminal at the top and go down Grandview Ave. about five or six doors.
0 ||| I come to Vegas to visit, to enjoy the scene and to explore different restaurants.  My gf lives in Vegas and took me to MB for dinner a few months back.  What a great experience - from the wine selection to the music to the ambiance on the water to the great service to the delicious food.  LOVED IT! so i signed up for the newsletter and found out about the brunch. \nLast weekend came for a Brunch on a Sunday.  It was a beautiful day so we requested a table on the patio in advance. I got a completely different experience - i'm not sure if brunches are a new thing to this place, but it was BAD.  The heating lamps werent working because it was chilly in the shade.  The server was pissed off at the world and didn't want to be there. The food was mediocre (and i'm being generous).  Advertized potatos were fried to a crips and were out of the bag frozen variety.  Poached eggs wasn't poached - it was fried!  The overall brunch experience was pretty disappoiting... \ni think i'll stick to going there for dinner and not brunch...   unless they catch up as a brunch place.
4 ||| If we didn't have a kid, we wouldn't be coming here, but since we do, it's a paradise for the little one. Consider becoming a member--it'll save you money in the long run...if you have a little one that LOOOOOOVES trains.  They have ramadas here, which are especially nice for birthday parties.  The new building of little trains is beautiful and mesmerizing.  The holiday lights are WONDERFUL!
3 ||| I lived here for 5 years until recently. Decent pricing for the neighborhood. Moved to another apartment in the complex when they weren't renewing leases so they could remodel. The new apartment was awesome! It had great upgrades and made me realize what crap out old unit was. \nUnfortunately our new neighbor was a raging alcoholic and chain smoker. Ended up breaking my lease early so I wouldn't get lung cancer or the same drinking problem just to sleep with all his noise. \nThey have two nice pools and a dog friendlyish park right next door. The office staff, especially Adriana, have always been really helpful, friendly, and professional. If I had to live in an apartment again, which I never intend on doing, it would be the Palms. That is if my old neighbor has succumb to cirrhosis of the liver by then.
4 ||| Great service and great food.  Love the combo plate.
4 ||| My sister had to come here for a minor operation, and the doctors and nurses were comforting and they were able to bring my sister to an easy state of mind before the operation.  She is very afraid of needles and the doctor worked with her and she was able to perform all of her tasks without any problems.  I liked how clean the rooms were and the nurses were very prompt.  If I have to visit any hospital for anything, I would choose this one.  Lets hope I don't have to worry about that though!
1 ||| ordered the huevos con chorizo. it was kinda pricey for the amount of food that was served. plus, the chorizo was pretty bland. i went in the morning and the place was packed with police/sheriff officers who stared at me because i didnt have a uniform.
0 ||| Omg. What the heck happened. I used to come here all the time for several years. It was $7.00 a haircut. Then I come back after a few months away and now it's doubled to $14.00! \n\nThe haircuts are so so. Average stylists. It's what I would pay 7 bucks for. Not 14.  With that price I'd rather go somewhere else. \n\nWay too expensive for what you get.
0 ||| This place smells like sewage.  It literally smells like ten years of urine, and feces.  If that's not bad enough, the help and patrons are just as bad as the smell.
4 ||| I love this church! The music is amazing, the people are very nice and its a very blessing place.
2 ||| My husband and I did a lot of research on Vegas wedding chapels before making our final choice on Chapel of the Flowers.  We needed to find one that would do a Wiccan handfasting ceremony. Chapel of the Flowers they said that they had done handfasting ceremonies before and it wouldn't be a problem at all.  So about 3 months before the wedding we booked it and paid in full.  We picked this place for the most part due to the photos, they are beautiful and that is something that was/is very important to us.  The pricing is a bit high but we had no problem paying it because the grounds looked very nice, the service had been ok, not bad but not out standing either and again great photos.\nFast forward to two weeks before the wedding. We get an email from our wedding planner saying that the ceremony we sent will not work.  She said that the ministers will not read a ceremony written out like that and that it also seemed to long.  Their weddings are about 11-13 minutes, ours was about 12 minutes which I told her so it fit in the time line perfectly.  There is a part of the ceremony called the hand ties and she said that they would just use that part in replacement for the unity candle, which was fine since we didn't want that any way but they wouldn't use anything else.  She said that they want to incorporate as much as they can for us and asked me what was most important.  I told her that a standard handfasting is between one hour to an hour and a half, getting it down to 11 minutes doesn't leave us room to cut it down any further.  I asked if she would send me the ceremony the ministers use so that my husband and I could work with both that and what we have so that we get what we want and the minister is happy.  Then she tells me they don't have anything written out.  What?  They don't have anything written out but they can't use the FULL written out ceremony we sent them?  I said ok well then how do they do this.  She said that each minister will speak with the bride and groom before the wedding starts to get to know us a bit and then just says whatever he feels fits us.  She recommended we watch some of the weddings they have on the web site which we did.  They are all ok I guess but seem awkward, you can tell that the minister doesn't know anything about the couple, they stumble and it just it's great.  My husband and I did not want anything close to the normal \"Do you take... blah blah blah\" It's not us and not at all what we wanted.  We also didn't want someone who doesn't know us trying to be funny about who we are.  I told her that I didn't understand why if they don't have a standard ceremony, can't they use ours?  She said that they have done it in the past but the couples haven't been happy with it because it doesn't run as smooth. So now we are two weeks before our wedding and being told that they can't do something they said they could and it's kind of the biggest part of our wedding.  I talked to the wedding planner about canceling and she said that we could but would have to pay $300.  Now had it been my mistake I would gladly have paid that, it would have only been right but it wasn't us, they were not holding up to their end of the contract and what we had been told not only over the phone but in writing.  Keep in mind that at no point did the wedding planner apologize for any of the... we'll say, misunderstanding.  She just kept saying what they can and can not do.  \nI talked to her manager who confirmed the same info.  She said that they had done \"the hand ties before\" and that is why they said it would be fine.  I told her that in the future she and her staff should ask people if they are Wiccan or Pagan, if so these people may likely want more then just a hand tie and will not want the standard and awkward Do you take... blah blah blah ceremony.  I don't think they misled us on purpose, they just aren't educated and they should be since weddings are what they do.  I told her that I expected a FULL refund and she did do that.\nNow, if you look on the web site and talk to them they tell you that all the ministers are non denominational which is true.  However if you dig really deep and hunt for it you'll find that they are non denominational Christianity ministers.  I think this is where the problem truly lies.  Our ceremony talked of our God and Goddess. I'm thinking this is where the problem is.  Again it's ok if they don't want to speak of Wiccan God's and Goddess's but this is another place where education comes in.\nThank Goddess our second choice place happen to have availability the same day and time.  We got everything and more for less money and it couldn't have been more perfect.\nIf you want something out of the norm you must be VERY clear and have them read it before you book and start planning here.
2 ||| FAQs and Tuber tips: Go to the site's website, it's listed...\n\nFirst time tubing with my friends and cousins.  We parked the car, rented tubes for $15 each which includes the bus ride to the site.  We did the 2 hour course.  They have longer, but everyone said it's a drag.\n\nWhen we got to the site, we tied our tubes together and tied our cooler into one tube; if you want to save, you can buy a floaty at the store that's made specifically to hold a cooler or drinks, etc.  Anyway, someone got the wrong sized tube.  We got the big one so we took the longest time to trying secure the cooler with rope.  It was soooo hot.  Feet were burning and I was sweating like crazy trying to tie the cooler in well.\n\nFinally we get in the water and started floated away and drinking.  The black tubes were hot.  I can't believe my friends who went last time forgot to tell us to bring sheets to cover the tubes - burned our skin.  As we floated we hit some rocks and some walls.  Be careful if you try to paddle or kick w/ your feet.  I kicked a rock and it hurt!  Some areas are shallow, other areas were deep.  One of my friends let his ass hang low and ended up bruising it after colliding w/ so much rocks.\n\nWe ended up running out of beer.  Make sure you bring enough beer!  We had given one beer away because this girl lost hers in the water; they regretted giving it away.  Then during the rest of the trip, they tried to mooch off others who'd be kind enough to donate.  Got 2 donates and one cigarette.  There was a group who packed their cigs in a water bottle and also put their lighters in another bottle.  Smart idea.\n\nWe had so much fun chatting with others around us.  We saw a guy walking on water like Jesus.  We let him float w/ us because he lost his group, who were about a mile away.  We tried to keep him hostage so we can get beer from his group, but no cigar lol.\n\nWe passed a section where ppl were cliffdiving.  It wasn't high but it looked fun.  If you want to do it, make sure your prepared to swim ahead of time.  My friends were down to do it but the river was moving too fast.  We saw a girl jump off topless, highlight of the day.  I tried to take pics of her with my (waterproof) camera but missed because the river was going so fast lol.  Near the end of the stop, prepare to get your feet hurt.  We had a hard time stopping and had these 2 guys help us.  Same guys even had a knife with them to help us cut our rope that kept the tubes together.  What life savers...\n\nFound out someone died at the river the same day we went.  PRetty sad.  Didn't find out why but make sure you go with a group of friends who know how to swim, or wear a life vest, and don't get drunk drunk.  It's supposed to be a fun event.\n\nWhat I didn't bring but will bring next time is music with waterproof everything.\nYou can bring your own floats too.  If anything, one person can drop your friends off at the river and that one person rides the bus for $12 all day.  Saves money.\nAlso, make sure you secure your shoes, people lost them at the river when we were there.  Also make sure you bring enough sunblock.  Some of my friends had to reapply many times.  If you wear sunglasses and think they may fall off, use a croakie.\n\nThis was such a fun experience for me.  I'm so going again.
4 ||| Like some of the other reviews, I initially went to the Wagon Yard because of a coupon (you guys should print more, looks like it brings you business!).  We've been a few times and the food is probably a 3 overall, it really depends on what you order.  The service staff have always done a good job, but I think we always get the head waitress (or is she the owner?).  But the place is just cool, so we keep going back.  If you go later on a Saturday evening, they have karoke and the people are actually pretty good.  They have a crowd of regulars, who want to make sure you feel welcome.  It's mostly an older crowd (I'm in my 20s), but on an evening when you are just looking for some chill entertainment, and if you love country music, check this place out.  It's like going to the Buffalo Chip in Cave Creek before everyone found out about it.   And not having to drive so far.
3 ||| Melissa is an exceptional trainer.  10 pounds down in a little more than 4 weeks and I couldn't be more motivated to keep going.  It's not just about working out but working on nutrition and my overall well-being.  I absolutely love it.
0 ||| Worst experience there. Not only did the waitress fail to tell me that I would be upgraded for my choice of side, but when she brought it out it had no Alfredo sauce with it and then she was missing for 15mins. She finally brought our check and then we t missing again for another 10 mins. When leaving the manager was upfront joking around with the host staff. All around an bad experience!
0 ||| Stay Away!  They damaged my car. If I were you I would not risk taking my car or any other vehicle to auto bell.
3 ||| I hit the Strip District about one weekend a month, and Penn Mac is always a \"must stop\". They have a fantastic cheese, olive, and cured meat selection, its basically a  one stop anitpasto plate. Penn Mac also has those hard to find Italian ingredients, fresh pastas, and great fresh bread. Their produce selection leaves a little to be desired, but the great thing about the strip is great produce is only a few doors away. This place does get PACKED on the weekends so I hope you can tolerate crowds.
1 ||| Saddens me to drop a star but tonight's fish was not up to par. It was a different breading and not as good. \n\nService was almost bad, no refills on water, never received the beer we asked for, and never received the last refill of fish. The wife salad was just ok, they were out of blue cheese. I swear shit like this only happens when she goes with me there. LOL
0 ||| As far as Nike Factory Stores go...this was one of the worst...I think they were remodeling when I was in there because they didn't have much to offer.
1 ||| We went here for breakfast.  I had Colorado green chili pork special with an egg on hash browns. The wife had the basic breakfast special; egg, hash browns, bacon & toast. The first bite of my Colorado green chili special was alright, but the farther I got into the more I noticed that the hash browns were raw.  It was also pretty bland with no flavor.  The coffee is free as long as you spend $4 on food..and there is a reason it's free, it was pretty bad.  The bacon on my wife's plate was fantastic, thick cut bacon done just right. It wasn't too crisp and not too chewy.  I did notice a sign in the window that they were hiring a cook...I can see why. It was $11 for our food which is a pretty good deal even if I didn't finish my food.  There were some other things on the menu I want to try, such as the stuffed crispy french toast!  So we will give this place at least one more try.  There was only one waitress and several of the tables were dirty, but at least the bathroom was clean.
3 ||| The al pastor tacos taste like a SLIM JIM. \n\nThe sope was good, the rice had an interesting flavor, and the beans were runny. The salsa was decent.
2 ||| Typical big box shop, new employees every time i have come in (high turnover speaks volume) poorly trained, most management are not riders, and no sense of urgency!!! Everyone i spoke with acted as if I were inconveniencing them by trying to spend money.\n\nSave your time and money, this place is a glorified Cycle Gear.
0 ||| Went in today to change out my front two tires. When I got home I noticed both rims were scratched up from a rookie with a wrench. Called in to notify manager that they scratched both of my front rims so he requested that I brought my vehicle back so they can inspect them. Reed (my installer) and I went outside to look at the rims. I showed him the marks that were made. So he went to go get his assistant manager Joey to come look at them. Joey went straight to the rear rims and pointed at scratches and declared they did none of them and they were already there. I told him to slow his roll that they didn't even work on my rear tires and that wasn't part of my complaint. I showed him the scratches on the front rims and he immediately started denying fault. I asked Reed and Joey who installed my tires and Reed's response was, \" I did, well I didn't install them but I was standing there.\" An answer my pet rock would give. I asked Joey if a new trainee was the one working on my car and he kind of just giggle and said no one of their senior members worked on it. Joey was saying how they can not do anything about the rims because they were not painted by a professional... How does Joey know where I got my rims painted at? By all means they weren't a 1000 dollar paint job but I did pay to get them painted and they looked good. We all went inside, Reed returned to the shop while Joey and I went to the computer to file a claim. Told me I should receive a call tomorrow about my claim. Overall experience was sloppy. The sales guy tried to slide in a 30$/tire warranty without saying anything until I caught him. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.
4 ||| I have been eating here for years, since I was a kid actually, and know the owners.  They are nice, hardworking folks that strive to make the best quality meal for you.  Think Kyoto bowl, but with better portions and more selection.  Everything is fresh and flavorful, with very reasonable prices.  My favorites to get here are the katsu bowl and the house chicken.  So if you are in the mood for fast-food Japanese/Chinese, Teriyaki Kitchen is an excellent choice.
0 ||| Terrible! My father-in-law got a haircut there just today and the guy cut his eyelid! Didn't even apologize! Didn't offer free haircut! Awful service!!
4 ||| So met my best friends in the world, Z and Dally, here for lunch today. I drove the 33 miles to Mesa in order to try a sub that I have been told is amazing. So, having trusted Z on many a thing and as he would tell you, always trust him when it comes to food, I was gleefully happy at the end of my eating experience. \n\nThere are a lot of subs to choose from and it took me about 5 minutes to finally decide on the La Canna. Salami and ham with provolone and olives. Get it on the garlic-herb bread. Have the happy dude behind the counter throw on some spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar, Parmesan, and oregano. The sub is toasted and doesn't shred the rough of your mouth, which happens to me quite frequently. I was still not satiated after this sub, so I split the White Widow with Z. Marinated chicken, bacon, provolone and ranch dressing. Again another great sub. \n\nThe employees were all in a good mood. Not sure if that was herb induced or not, but it was pleasant. Phylis behind the register was particularly kind. She came complete with the stereotypical stoner laugh. She's cute. \n\nIt was totally worth the drive and I will be back in the future to try something else.
0 ||| I warn you: Wednesday is Country Night. If you don't like Country, make sure a friend doesn't drag you here Wednesday. \n\nDon't say I didn't warn you.\n\nGood sized bar menu, I didn't mind the place.
1 ||| 24 hour Pho, they know how to do it.  If only they didn't make the broth so salty it would have been good.  The meat came out medium rare, just enough so I could dunk it under the noodles to let it cook a little before consuming.\n\nThey definitely want you in and out.  A few people wanted to take our order and before we could finish we were asked if we were done and the check was coming.\n\nMaybe the other dishes were good, but when they say Pho, the first item I would go for is the Pho Tai.
0 ||| Don't go here, incompetent employees! Go to a shop that backs up their work and won't try to rob you!
0 ||| HORRIBLE FOOD. My chicken sandwich tasted like rubber, the curly fries weren't cooked enough, and the wings were mediocre. \n\nStop supporting horrible chains like this and they will all go away.
1 ||| Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\n\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.
4 ||| Best hot wings in the city of Charlotte! I personally like them hot because it comes packed with flavor. But, BBQ is good also. The sweet tea is good. The Mac n Cheese is alright. I met the owner, Lupie...she was cool! Very humble and genuinely appreciated us coming in and telling her how much we loved their food :)
3 ||| My husband and I grabbed a bite here for the first time the other night.  We had previously eaten at locations in NYC.  The tacos were good, with tasty ingredients, but they were barely lukewarm, which detracted from the taste.  They need to figure out how to serve up tacos that stay warm between leaving the serving line and getting to a nearby table!
0 ||| Drove by this place since 84', finally decided to try it out, at first I was a little turned off by the young staff, not friendly at all, they didn't have Italian rope sausage, I had to pre order, very odd and the display case was very dirty and down right nasty.\nI did get the polish sausage and a few other goodies since I was already there.\nThe flavors of the meats are brilliant and the meat texture is awesome.\n\nI will be back next weekend, maybe a different staff this time.
0 ||| STAY AWAY!!!\n\nWORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever encountered. My wife and I have been ordering food from this establishment for years.  We have been loyal customers for years. Last week I ordered steak that was raw on the middle and they told my wife we could just finish cooking the meat in the microwave. We put our usual order in this week and they made another mistake. The meat tasted sour and they forgot the teriyaki sauce that goes with the teriyaki steak. They refused to give me a credit for next time or refund my money.  They told us, their policy is to only give you credit one time for one of their mistakes and they would never refund anybody's money regardless of the situation.  I have never written a review, but I feel a obligation to warn as many people as I can. We work to hard for our money to have places like this STEAL from us.
0 ||| I had granite installed in my bathroom. The folks at Papagno's seemed helpful enough, but after this experience, I would not use them again.\n\nI called them initially and they gave me a quote to add granite for my bathroom. The quote seemed O.K. so I went to their store to work out the details. Basically I wanted a 2cm granite in a fairly common color. It should be pretty simple.\n\nWe talked about what we wanted to Maria, and she told us instead of 2cm granite, she would \"upgrade\" us to 3cm for no charge. I wasn't really in favor, but I agreed if the backsplash was made to look correct. She said \"We'd never want you to have something that didn't look good.\"  My guess was that they had a scrap of 3cm that they wanted to use. We pay a deposit and leave.\n\nA few days later we get a call from them, saying that since we have 3cm granite, we need to pay additional money to have the backsplash shaved down.  I told them the 3cm granite was not my choice and I wasn't paying any more.\n\nA few days go by and they call back. They \"found\" some 2cm granite and we needed to go in to approve it. O.K. we go in and the granite looks fine, and we pick an edge. Also, we asked them if they could give use the scrapes of granite from the sink cutouts, and they say fine.\n\nThey call a few days later to give us the install date. They can't give us a time, but say they will call the night before with the time. Never get a call, but at 8am the installers arrive. The installers seem to do a good job, but we notice the edge was not the one we asked for. Also, we ask about the scrap pieces, and the installers know nothing about either problem. \n\nWe call the store and they explain the edge was the edge talked about initially but they never apologized for their mistake.  We asked about the scrap pieces, and they said they had them, would \"polish\" them, and they would call us when they were ready. They have never called and it was two weeks ago.\n\nEvery other granite company we have ever used  always had the sink(s) installed before the granite was delivered. Papagno's installed it on-site. Now I know why the others DON'T install on-site. The smell of the glue was horrible, and it took days for it to go away. \n\nThe granite looks good, but with the hassles and deceptions we  experienced, I would NEVER use them again. Never again.
4 ||| I'm glad I finally had the chance to finally eat at Ruffino. Upon entering the doors, the ambiance and decor was nice. We (wife and I) were promptly greeted and escorted to our table.  The place was packed. There was also live music playing, which was nice to hear.\n\nOne thing I really liked was the salad being created and tossed to your liking at your table. \n\nI really enjoyed the mozzarella that was on the caprese salad.\n\nThe chicken parm and pasta I ordered was excellent. I really enjoyed the sauce. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and felt satisfied after.  My wife ordered the rigatoni and also enjoyed the food. I though the meal was a bit dry. A bit more sauce would have been better. \n\nOne thing I really noticed was the service. The waiter was great and there was also staff filling your water on a routine basis. The manager also personally came by at the end of the meal to check how things went. A nice touch.\n\nThe noise level was a bit high, but there was a large party a short distance from us, which probably contributed to the higher decibel level.\n\nThe one downside is the limited parking spots. That's a good thing that the restaurant is busy, but bad if you have trouble finding a spot.\n\n\nMy wife and I will definitely be back on a date night in the future.
3 ||| I thought this place was pretty good. I kind of suck when it comes to reviewing pizza...I love anything dough-y that has cheese and sauce on it.  It's a bit pricey (18\" pie was about $24.00). We got olives and pineapple on it and I have no complaints. \n\nThe guy running the place was very friendly as well! That always adds a star in my book. I'll go back on my next trip to Phoenix.
4 ||| Great location - make sure you ask for a view of the river.  Worth the money.
4 ||| I've been to Teakwoods a couple different times and have enjoyed myself each and every time. My last visit was one of the most memorable. We were there in large group and they ran out of the larger draft glasses on the last 2 of us (me and my boyfriend). So, they brought us each out a mini-pitcher full of beer and charged us for the glass. Amazing! \n\nThe service is great- quick and friendly and with peanuts on the table, you can't go wrong. Inside, it's your standard local bar (with peanut shells all over the floor). And, on the outside, it's tucked inside a strip mall with ample parking.
3 ||| They now accepting credit cards . Don't go close to their closing . They were extremely busy. Try mixing the green burro with beans for those who do not like it that spicy.  They have the best refried beans . Also try their tacos
0 ||| I came here to. get a full set and a pedicure. My acrylics cracked on 4 of my nails within the first week. My pointer finger nail completely came off also in the first 5 days! They did not cut my cuticles and obviously did not sand my nails down enough for the acrylic to stick. I spent over 150$ and got the worst nail job I've ever gotten. I've been getting my nails done for over 6 years now. Go to infinity on greenway and 7th street. Don't waste your money on this over priced low quality salon.
4 ||| I've been here about three times and it is on my places to go list for when I visit Chandler.  The first time I decided I should get the Redfish Plate because I figured it oughta be good since they are named after it.  It was not a disappointment, in fact was one of the best fish dinners I ever remember having.    I don't remember what I got the other times but know I enjoyed it.  I like the decor and if I remember right, they gave me some Mardi Gras necklaces I still have.  I will definitely go back next trip there.
0 ||| I keep giving this place a chance but yet again I'm disappointed. I had my dogs boarded here for two days and spoke to three different people about having my two dogs bathed as well as their nails trimmed while they were boarded. When I picked them up and was reviewing the bill, I noticed I was not charged for those services. The woman at the counter asked if I requested the bath and nail trim when I dropped them off! Yes, I told her, with three different people! I told her forget it and get my dogs. When I left, I was told my dogs need dental work. Every time I go there, I leave feeling like I've dealt with a used car salesman. Stop trying to sell me unnecessary services and focus on completing those services that have been requested! Yes I understand a $25.00 bath doesn't matter when you keep trying to sell me a $300.00 dental service. No more of this place!
1 ||| Stayed here for business last week and my reaction is: meh.    Nothing special about this Scottsdale Road property.  It was really pretty expensive $279/night in April and you don't get a lot for your money.    Nothing \"wrong\" with the place, but you can do better for the money.   I don't know how they can call it a \"resort\" unless have a pool qualifies you - no golf/tennis, no spa, etc.  Just a hotel.
0 ||| I recently flew US Airways from Phoenix to Chicago. It was the bargain on Hotwire so that is what I went with. I cannot complain about the rate... $237 round trip is cheap these days. However, you are nickel-and-dimed for luggage check-in, a coke, snacks, etc. I limited myself  to just one small suitcase, which added $15 each way. (Thankfully I did not exceed the luggage weight or there would have been another fee.) A second suitcase would have been an additional $25.\n\nSo fair experience overall, HOWEVER, I discovered that passengers can bring cats and dogs on the airplane. Maybe I have been living in a cave, but how is this even possible? First of all I am severely allergic to cats, and I know I am not the only one out there because that is a very common allergy. Guess where the little feline was?! You guessed it, right under my seat. For whatever reason I seemed to not have much of an allergic reaction. I am not sure if it was the recirculated air in the airplane or what. \n\nI did ask the flight attendant if they were indeed allowed. She replied with a plastic and enthusiastic smile \"Oh yes! We allow cats and dogs and have for quite some time.\" No doubt she probably had a cat at home. I inquired about the possibility of the animals peeing or worse! Again with the plastic smile, she explained they are in carriers -- as if that solves this biological need. Really????  I don't know about you, but I am not crazy about being trapped 10,000 feet up having to smell cat urine on a 4-hour flight. How is that allowed? How does that meet health codes? Are other airlines allowing this too. Whasssuppp pussycat?!?!
3 ||| First off- as an 11-year Madison resident, I ate at Cracker Barrel for the very first time (here) last weekend.  We met friends from out of town, and overall it was pretty good.  The staff had no problem pulling together two tables for the 7 of us, and service was both prompt and correct.  CB serves breakfast all day, and what a breakfast it is!  Portions were fair, not huge, and the price was right.  Bacon, eggs, biscuits and grits- yum.  My only gripe was that the sausage gravy was gelatinous and plopped out of the bowl instead of pouring.  That was kind of gross.\n\nCB clearly caters to insterstate travelers, and it does this well.  You can also find some interesting items in their huge \"country store\", from cutesy mugs and figurines to sweatshirts for Gramps and Easter dresses for the young'uns.
1 ||| Had great coloring experiences and not so great haircuts. Tried to stick with them, but it was just one mediocre cut after another.\n\nGreat location, and ahem, atmosphere.
1 ||| Went for breakfast and ordered a vegetable omelet and turkey bacon.  The turkey bacon tasted so old that I could not eat it.  The omelet tasted OK. My utensils were dirty and I had to get set from another table.
3 ||| I came here for dinner last night with my boyfriend, Lance. Lance has been to Cabo multiple times.. I've never been. My first impression was that it's awesome inside, laid back atmosphere. The beer he got was really good, but it had a funny name I don't remember what it was called.\n\nThe waitress brought over chips and the corn salsa that I read a lot about. It was dried out, and looked like it was old. Not impressed there. We then ordered a side of guacamole! THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. I'll definitely recommend that.\n\nLance ordered the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos that were on Guy Fieri's show.. they were actually really tasty but a VERY fishy aftertaste. I've never tasted Mahi Mahi, so I'm not sure if that is normal. I ordered the Carne wrap which was just average.\n\nOverall this place didn't really IMPRESS me as much as I thought it would. But I liked it.
4 ||| This is a college bar, if you are looking for something quiet, go else where, if you are looking for something super clean and nice, go else where. If however you are looking for a fun, somewhat divey bar with awesome amounts of greasy fried food, you have found heaven. The prices are great, the amount of food you get is great, and if you looking for a good time this place is great.\n\nWhat I would recommend:\nCheese Curds - no self respecting Wisconsin bar can mess this up but holy crap these were good curds.\nThe Curd Burger - I had trouble moving after this but soooo worth it. A cheese burger with cheese curds and onion rings on it, what more could you ask for?\nThe Brats - both white and red, or both, they are great, brats is in the name of the bar for a reason.
0 ||| I have been to this car wash many times over the years. My recent experience was the worst & I will not ever be returning. My USB was stolen out of my truck. I called back within 5 minutes of leaving to inquire. I was told they would look into it and call me back. They didn't call me back I had to call them. I was told by the manager they looked for it and couldn't find it. He didn't offer an apology or compensation. If you decide to patronage this car wash TAKE YOUR VALUABLES OUT OF YOUR CAR!!!
3 ||| If you are looking for a top notch full service gym then this is it.  The amenities are great and the workout space is adequate.  The only knock that I have on the gym is the size of the weight room.  The cardio room has plenty of machines and the pickup basketball throughout the week is always fun.
2 ||| The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service. \n\nIt is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals.... \n\nI'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer. \n\nTry talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states \"the manager is off till next week.\" \n\ni will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard
1 ||| The food here taste really spoiled and rushed. I can say they are a lot tidier than DJ but the food is horrific. You expect customers to eat here please make sure everything is fresh and quality.
4 ||| What can I add that others haven't already said?  This place is adorable, the food is delicious, the wine selection is admirable and the employees are great.  \n\nGo.  Go now.
1 ||| For a Vietnamese girl who grew up eating pho in Little Saigon, California, the beef pho here  just doesn't cut it.  It's not even up to par.  If you haven't had the best, then you may not be able to tell the difference.  The most important thing in a good pho is the broth.  The broth is the hardest and takes the longest to make.  The broth holds all the flavor; it makes or breaks the pho.  The rest are just additions to the bowl of broth.  Here, I don't know if it's because the broth is too watered down, or if the spices are off, but the broth is just not satisfying.  A good pho broth is made from boiling beef bones with plenty of marrow for hours with spices like cloves and star anise.  Pho is supposed to be a hearty meal in which the combination of protein, spices, and warmth  puts you into a slight narcotic trance. It calms your nerves and makes you want to chill the rest of the day. It is the ultimate comfort food.  However, the beef pho at this restaurant was not hearty enough and certainly did not hit the spot.
3 ||| Pesto's rocks the kazbah! It is a hot little spot in an armpit of a strip mall.  The wine bar is movin' and shakin' almost every night of the week. Forget, 98South, 56East, if you want to chat with a bunch of fun people about absolutely anything with a staff that is there to cater to your every wine desire, well, Pestos is great. \n\nThe wine list is a treat to drink yourself through and should be on someone's - maybe mine - top 75 things to do list! As lovely as the wine list is, what truly is the cherry on this sweet slice are the bartenders. They are not shy about a generous pour, love a long chat about absolutely nothing and know absolutely everything about the wine they serve and love to share. What is not to like about this establishment....well, the food is just okay. Hey, its' Chandler. Wadda ya want? The pizza crust has  improved recently and well, the appetizers have never been anything to right home about.  Does the food detract, yes but just a little bit, hit the bar, serve yourself up a flight and turn to your neighbor and start chatting!
4 ||| This is the best Chinese restaurant in town, although, not the entire menu is Chinese food.  My favorite is the Singapore ricestick (#N8) and ginger scallion gyoza tong mein (#26).  The noodles are made from scratch and nothing compares.
1 ||| I used to love Bruegger's bagels, but mainly for their salt bagel. They make the perfect roast beef sandwich on this particular bagel and they may have just signed their own death warrant with me if they've discontinued making them. It tastes pretty damn close to a Beef on Weck. I went to this location the other day and they had a \"pretzel\" bagel in place of my beloved salt.  I did ask for the salt but they told me that they had the pretzel instead. I though, what the heck, I'll give it a try. Dammit...it comes nowhere close to the original! \n\nThe line got too crowded for me to go up there and air my grievance because I did have another complaint that must be addressed: SOUP! Brueggers used to have a wealth of soups that they would rotate on a daily basis. Now they only have 2! Chicken spaetzle or black bean! Every single time I go to this location, it's the same-old-same-old choices of soup! I realize it's Summer and maybe they don't move soup like they would during cooler weather, but if you're offering it...mix it up!!!! If you go on their site, they show they have about 8 different varieties but not this particular location. They used to have a delicious Velvet Veggie Cheese a few years ago, but discontinued it. I even complained about that online and just got a thank you/try our other soups bull$hit courtesy response.\n\nNo salt bagel is a deal breaker with me with Brueggers. The lack of soup varieties I can live with but killing one of my favorite sandwiches cannot be forgiven. I will return just to see for myself the next time if my precious salt bagel has been permanently replaced. If it has, I will stage a walkout...but nobody else will follow.\n\nThe WiFi sucks, too.\n\nThe only plus here is the friendly staff.\n\nYour sad pal,\nWalter
2 ||| This place is cheese-tastic to the max.\n\nThe decor reminds me of a place you would find inside a Six Flags or safari themed adventure daycare or something. There are elephants EVERYwhere. I get it, Elephant Bar, but there's a way to do it and theres a way to beat a dead elephant into the ground and then run it over with a safari jeep and then wear it as a hat. \n\nMy friend and I had just seen that Chimpanzee movie in the same complex so we thought we would be clever and come here for a beer. I can't report on the food, since we weren't hungry. We did check out the menu though and holy crap it's huge. I really dislike huge menus, it's usually a sign of lack of focus. It's all sort of fusion stuff, and if you don't know what Fried Shrimp or Mac n Cheese looks like, don't despair, there are pictures of every dish. Ugh. \n\nIt's interesting that every inch of this place is covered with safari themed decor, but the patio is completely devoid of decoration. It's just a few patio chairs and tables fenced in on the side of the building as an afterthought. I guess it was a nice respite from all the elephants and giraffes and nonsense. \n\n$22 gets you three large beers not including tip for the nice, but completely average bartender who called me \"dude\". \n\nMeh.
3 ||| My very first visit to Benihana was for my free birthday meal. I arrived at about 5:45pm and since I didn't have a reservation I had to wait until about 6:30pm for the next hibachi table that had room. No biggie I went to the bar, had glass of Cabernet and order the dragon roll. I mean it was happy hour and all and it was pretty reasonable so I had no problem waiting. \n\nWell lucky me gets seated with a family of 5 1/2. I say that because it was the two adults, three boys (the oldest was celebrating his 14th birthday) and a newborn baby girl, hence the 1/2. The father looked like a George Bush Jr clone, I KID YOU NOT! I had to do a double take that is how much this man resembled him. Let me just say that this family loves them so sushi. They ordered a ton of it along with their man courses. My kind of family! They were pretty comical that's for sure. \n\nOur server (who's name I never got until I got the bill) was friendly enough but I kinda felt like and after thought as she seemed to be more focused on the family. No biggie but even though my meal was \"free\" doesn't mean you have to treat me any different. I say \"free\" as it was free up to the first $30 and anything over you had to cover. Again no biggie. \n\nI ordered the Splash and Meadow which was steak and colossal shrimp. We started off with the miso soup which was really good, especially since it had fried onions and scallions mixed in the broth and wasn't overly salty like some miso soups can be. We received our salads very late, like we were in the middle of our hibachi presentation when we received them. I must say I was disappointed in the salad dressing as it was just blech. Almost like it was missing something and believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to my salad. Oh well. \n\nThe fried rice cost extra and I didn't know it and had I realized it, I would have just ordered regular white rice. It is mixed with some chicken, vegetables, etc, which I understand the extra cost but honestly it tasted as if the rice was undercooked. It was still hard. Another disappointed but oh well. Now the shrimp appetizer along with the all the vegetables and the colossal shrimp that came with my meal were very good. The chef was generous with the shrimp because two of the kids didn't want any. I think they were pretty full from all the sushi that they ate. Now onto my steak. I was a little disappointed because I wanted it medium rare and it was medium done but still not too bad. By the time everything was actually ready, I was full as I had had that dragon roll while waiting for my table and had tasted everything as it was prepared. So needless to say I ended up taking my entire meal home. I spent about $20 total at the bar and for dinner including tip. I will probably be back again someday soon. \n\nSide note, I did notice that they have a sign for all you can eat sushi for $26.95 Sunday thru Thursday. I may have to go back and try that one day.
1 ||| OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, hurtful messages. And do not preach to me the hazards, both socially and physically, of eating at buffets. Because, frankly, I've done that to myself already. Eating at Mexican buffets was part of the bf's growing up days in San Antonio. One day he asked me to go, and since he's irresistible to me, I said yes. Upon entering Pancho's, I realized it was like a Mexican Chuck E Cheese. More kids than you'd find at Mia Farrow's house. Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning. Why is there a white haze wafting from the hallway? Oh. Some darling little child had activated the FIRE EXTINGUISHER! Yea. And mommy was too busy ordering her Dos XX to notice. You'd think this would have sent us running. But we persevered. I thought I'd be safe and get a taco, enchilada with beans and rice. All were simply horrific. Malo. Horrible. No bueno. The more I recall this day, the more I feel a need for a buffet support group of some kind. Hello, my name is Thomas. I ate at Pancho's. HELLO THOMAS! Good bye Panchos.
0 ||| Stayed at the Biltmore and went here because of an American Express dining certificate.  The experience: a dirty soup spoon, sending back the soup, taking a bite of scallop that made me sick, and terminating the dining experience as a result ... If I could give \"negative stars,\" I would.  This is a nasty, as in dirty-ass nasty, restaurant pretending to be fine dining.
4 ||| I am really surprised by the bad reviews here. I love this place. We have been eating here for years and the food is always great. It has such a homey neighborhood feel. I also think Bon Appetit is a really good value. I eat out in Madison often and think many more expensive places in the area serve food that is not as consistently good. I think they have everything working for them, fresh local ingredients, intimate setting and inventive changing menu. \nMy most recent visit was 10/27/11 and again we had a great meal, appetizer sampler, meatballs and polenta, and homemade cookies for dessert, it was all fantastic.
2 ||| large selection of draft and specials on pricing.  Quality staff.
0 ||| I love Boston Market. The food is warm and it hits the spot when you want a good dinner. It's not fine food of course, but you know what, I'm a simple man. It's good.\n\nThe reason for my one star review, was because of their service. I just got back from a trip, so I figured I'd take 5 minutes to write about it real quick while it's fresh in my head and I'm eating their food.\n\nI ordered online to take it out. It's a late night here at work, and this Boston Market is just down the street from the office, so I got me and the team some dinner. It said it would be ready at 7:18 pm when I was checking out my order online on the website, so about 20 minutes. Nothing too hard, 20 minutes is fine. Cool.\n\nWhen I arrive there, I tell them I'm picking up my order. Everyone up front and in the kitchen looked like they were in training. All in their young 20's, maybe late teens. All seemed to be struggling to organize the couple of orders they had. 3 people were there, counting me. 3-4 people were on the line making the dinner plates. The cashier printed out my receipt, makes a mistake, asks for my receipt back, and etc.\n\nThen he says, \"Okay, we'll get this made for you right now.\"\n\n...Huh? So I ordered online for nothing or something?\n\nI waited about another 15-20 minutes. Order was finally ready. I take it back to the office five minutes away. I eat the first bite, the vegetables and meat were sort of cold. Like room temperature at best.\n\nI don't blame the kids up there working. They were doing their best, they weren't joking around, they just seem overwhelmed and learning. I blame the manager for putting them all up there. Horrible decision. Horrible service. And to end it all, when I got back and handed out dinner to everyone, I realized I forgot drinks. I admit, that was probably all my fault though. They said \"You're good to go\" when my order was finally ready, and I just took it and left. \n\nI paid for those drinks but you know what? I didn't care anymore. Too frustrated.

4 ||| Our water heater stopped working at 9 pm and Eli arrived after 9:30 pm he seemed to be on the level of genius and had us back in action with in about 20 minutes thank you Eli!!! Honest, professional, and knowledgeable!
4 ||| I recently went in to have them install a JL Audio 700/5 amp with a JL Audio 10\" sub. I was so satisfied with the work that I went in the following day to have speakers installed. The staff was very helpdful and they don't just look to sell you anything. I plan on going back to have a remote start installed. I would recommend this place to anyone!!
3 ||| Every time I'm in town I stop by this place since I went to school with some of the guys who tend bar here. While the place isn't the greatest, mostly due to the fact that it's about twenty feet from wall to wall at its widest point, I'll give it an above-average (for me) three stars for originality and spunk. While Tiki bars may be prevalent in Pacific island tourist traps, you don't see too many dahntahn.\n\nSide note: make sure you card the senoritas here to avoid statutory rape charges. Check for ID forgeries. =)
0 ||| WORTHLESS\n\nI wish there was a minus 10 stars for this place. I dropped off two nearly new custom fitted New Era hats a week ago and was assured they would be ok for dry cleaning. When I picked them up this week, thank goodness I looked in the box. They shrunk and had crinkled fabric above the rim!!! \n\nThey proceeded to get the owner and he told his employees in front of me that he does not do hats and that they should of never of taken them in. I told him I would give it a few days to see of the wrinkles came out, got my $10 back and took photos of them for my records.\n\nAfter matching them up with similar New Era fitted hats I have when I got home, they definitely were shrunk. I called him back about an hour later and mentioned that I did not think they were dry cleaned. He proceeded to tell me he dry cleaned them himself!! So if they don't take hats in as a policy, why did the owner dry clean them and if he did, he needs to look at retiring because he has know idea how to dry clean!\n\nBad experience, bad service and bad place to do business. Don't go there.
4 ||| Love the ambiance of this bar, it truly feels like you've left phoenix and arrived in NYC... however, be prepared to pay NYC prices here. Very cool inventive cocktails, comfortable lounge setting, elcectic menu, and music to match the mood! Hands down my favorite bar in Phoenix! If you feel like getting dressed up and not having to deal with your typical Scottsdale crowd, check this place out!! And try a dirty martini!!
0 ||| I've used LensCrafters for at least 10 years. After my experience at this location, I won't ever be back.\n\nBad attitudes all around in this place. I left feeling angry, defensive, and very disappointed. The girl (yes, girl...not woman) I talked to about my frames had the most stuck up attitude I've ever encountered in a situation where customer service is required. It took a lot of self control for my husband and I to not return the snotty quips she kept throwing at us. \n\nAfter tentatively putting in an order for glasses, I told this girl we would be calling tomorrow to confirm and pay for the difference (after insurance.) I wanted to see if another optical store would prove to be easier to deal with and be more deserving of a loyal customer. My husband and I visited another place closer to home right after and I immediately put in my order there instead. \n\nLensCrafters doesn't deserve a courtesy call from me to say I went with someone else, nor do I expect their customer service to be superior enough to follow up on my order. I'm never taking my family back to LensCrafters.
1 ||| I was a little shocked with the ethics of this practice.  There website reads \"If you'd like to learn more, please contact us for a free consultation. We do offer bilingual staff and translator phones are available.\" When I scheduled a \"free consultation\" I was really impressed with the doctor.  Then I received a bill and Bethany Home Women's Health care and they billed my insurance.  When I called to ask why I had been billed for a \"free\" service, I was told it's only free if you don't have insurance, but they would waive the copay.
4 ||| I love this place. It's a small piece of the Midwest right here in Vegas. They have cheese curds and fish fry on the menu and Packers on the tv. What more could you want? The food here is a very good quality bar and grill style. I've had burgers, wings and ribs and they're all good. They also have one of the best craft brew beer menus in town. They always have seasonal things on tap and are constantly updating their taps. If you love beer and bar food this is a must try.
4 ||| Great restaurant, love it! Happy hour is the bomb! Definitely recommend the Asian nachos and the sweet potato fries.
0 ||| We just ordered our food and had two edible items. The two bags of chips that accompanied our heroes. Meatball parm hero tasted like it had been frozen and thawed a few times. Definitely tasted spoiled and after two bites I threw it out. My husband had the eggplant parm hero and it was pretty much batter, cheese and sauce. The tiramisu was FROZEN!!!  Even if you order your desserts pre-made from Sysco, at least thaw the dang thing first. Not even worth calling back to fix it. Will not order from there again. Didn't try the pizza but no point in that now. Once you bite into spoiled food you're done.
2 ||| Quick drive thru if you are on a lunch break, nice staff.  Went at an off time for a small fry and small frosty since I was hungry and needed a snack (~2 p.m.).  Fries were hot and tasted fresh and the frosty was delicious as always.\n\nParking lot is poorly designed, so it can back up into the main road, which blocks traffic flow and irritates other drivers.  It can also block you into a parking spot in their already rather small private parking lot and you will need to wait for a kind driver to not move forward in the line for you to be able to back out.  I would recommend parking in the lot close by and walking over to avoid this dilemma!
0 ||| Not only the worst BK franchise I've ever been to... but probably the worst-managed restaurant franchise I've ever encountered. It's a like a bad (bad) movie...\n\nOPEN ON two guys and a girl in a GREEN SOUL ordering drive through from Burger King on East Wash. They are hungry, but their order is easy. Just three burgers, twp fries, and one drink.\n\nAUDIO OVER (BK INTERCOM VOICE, with a bored lackluster air): \"Okay, drive up to the window.\"\n\nThe CAR pulls up behind two other cars waiting for their orders. And they wait. And wait. And wait. Six minutes later, the first car finally gets their food and drives off.\n\nThe CARS pull up closer. And they wait. And wait. And wait.\n\nA few minutes later, two uniformed BURGER KING EMPLOYEES, one man and one woman, exit the restaurant. They hang out in by the waiting CARS in front of the restaurant. Chatting for a few minutes, then amble back into the restaurant.\n\nThe CARS continue to wait. Minutes more pass.\n\nTwo more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food.\n\nThe DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, \"This is ridiculous, we've been waiting over 10 minutes, I'm getting out of here.  Mickey D's is right over there.... Wait... Hey, are those BK employees carrying out FOOD?!\"\n\nBURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1, puts up her arm carrying a huge bag of TAKEOUT and uses her body to physically block the GREEN SOUL from leaving. The TODDLER wanders aimlessly and dangerously around the parking lot.\n\nThe CAR in front of the GREEN SOUL receives their order finally, and drives off. The CAR waiting for food behind the SOUL peels out of line, barely missing the wandering TODDLER.\n\nBURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting at the CASHIER through the window): \"How long have these nice people been waiting?! \n\nCASHIER (searching for the order ticket): \"Um... 15 minutes.\"\n\nBK EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting): \"Well, give them two free ice creams for making them wait so long!\"\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #1 (quietly): \"It's okay, we just want the food we ordered.... And, besides, there are three of us. Not two.\"\n\nBK EMPLOYEE (angrily shouting through the cashier window): \"Just get them some ice cream... they were almost going to leave, you guys are so slow. Lucky I stopped them. You're the manager. Manage!\"\n\nA few more minutes pass. One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers. Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives. The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash. Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn't in the way.\n\nSOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: \"Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!? \n\nSOUL DRIVER: What's wrong with it?\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #1: \"It's cold. And I mean cold. It doesn't taste like meat. It's just rubbery and tasteless... and where's the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted. There's a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise. The bun crusty and stale.... do I need to go on--?\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: \"And my fries are soggy and cold, too.... and no ketchup packets in the bag. And my bun's stale, too!\"\n\nSOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: \"that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, 'smile, you're on candid camera!\"\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #1: \"Or 'Punked.\"\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #2: \"We were punked, all right. Let's ditch this sorry excuse for food and order Culver's... the food is always hot and delicious there. And the staff is nice and helpful, too.\n\nThe GREEN SOUL exits East Wash, and on the way into CULVER'S, PASSENGER #1 exits the vehicle, and throws the BK bags of food away in the CULVER'S garbage can. \n\nSOUL PASSENGER #2 getting back into the car: \"Never again.\"\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #1 and SOUL DRIVER: \"Never again!\"\n\nTHE END.
0 ||| Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich,  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf. \nHowever, lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded.\nThey Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's.
4 ||| The food was excellent and the service was attentive. The clientele was the only drawback on my visit. This is more to do with me than the restaurant. I wanted privacy and intimacy, but the people next to us seemed to want to be part of our dinner experience.\n\nIt is a very cozy restaurant and I will definitely go there again. The food was outstanding! I definitely recommend the warm goat cheese salad.
0 ||| so far, not impressed. walked in, place has 1 table full of about 8 people. and  a couple people waiting for food. other then that, all the other tables are vacant, and dirty! it's not busy, why isn't it clean? i sit at a dirty table... dude says it will be 6-7 minutes and if i mind the wait... i said no. 10 minutes go by, and i only ordered 2 slices of pepperoni. you think this would be ready at lunch time, right? maybe not...so it takes longer then what he said... i get it in 15.. and it is just cheese pizza re heated up with whatever topping you want, not fresh.... but hot as hell! sauce is not very tasty, dough is very bland. the cheese was really good though, and the hint of italian herbs seasoning help the taste. The crust was nice and crisp though... i wont be back. food didn't do it for me. even if a place is dirty and unorganized, i'll still come back if the food is awesome!!! but not the case at Pisa Pizza. It's ok food with a dirty atmosphere, 2 tv's and only 1 on playing nothing interesting.... very boring nothing special, not very good service.... i'll say no more.
0 ||| Man oh man do I wish I could give negative stars. I was visiting Arizona from LA with some friends and we decided to go out. Mind you, I go to country bars out here ALL the time and they're incredibly fun. This place was a DISASTER!!!! I have never been so baffled by a crowd or music. We went into each room hoping for SOME sort of normal music or crowd, but it just did not exist. I was absolutely stunned and almost in a culture shock. I go to hip hop clubs in LA ALL the time and they are never as dirty or as rowdy as the dance floor at Graham's Central Station. My goodness! They even charge an entrance fee. HILARIOUS. The door guy claimed I go there ALL the time, and when I told him it was my first time, he didn't believe me. These people are nutso. A friend of ours was supposed to meet us there, but LUCKY him, I told him to stay far far away. *sigh* It was quite an experience. One I wish and hope that I will never ever have to live through again.
4 ||| fast service, highly recommend checking this place out..sat down to play piano tiles and my watch finished in a heartbeat
4 ||| Hi Werner!! Yep gotta give a special shout out to the newest bartender on his first day  working at Rokerji. He was awesome and he spoiled me and Soraya rotten. :)\n\nThis is cute but small little place. As I was walking up, two different couples instantly said, I hope you have a reservation as they were walking away. Uhoh... this can't be good. I called Soraya who was in route to ask if she had made reservations.. hmm nope. Crap. So when she arrives, I sucker her into going downstairs since everyone that went down, came right back up. Lo and behold there were two seats at the bar. Hmm interesting that no one saw that lol. We hoisted ourselves up and was immediately greeted by Werner as well as the rest of the bar staff. We ordered our wine a bottle of the cupcake wine, which was delicious and it was half off seeing as it was Monday :). We also ordered the prime rib sliders, brie toasts, and the tacos. The people next to us had commented on how hot the tacos were and was wondering if we could handle the heat as they said they couldn't. Don't get me wrong, they were spicy, but I make things way spicier so I was use to it. Soraya well not so much lol.\n\nThe tacos, sliders, and brie toasts were so good, The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the au jus to dip it in was num yummy. We also ordered the flour-less chocolate cake that was more like a sinful fudge. Delicious. We even got to move over to the fire place to continue chatting it up and enjoy our wine and dessert.\n\nI will definitely be back, especially if Werner is working. :)
0 ||| DO NOT GET YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE! I came here for an oil change and tire rotation. The guy told me my cabin air filter was gone and he would replace it for half the cost. I ended up paying $100! I checked the reciept and there were so many extra charges on there it was ridiculous! I suppose I could of argued but the guys that work there are kind of scary.  I get all my service done at Camelback Toyota and they are always super nice and never try to rip me off even when I try to act dumb on purpose just to see if they will try to rip me off. I will never come back here!
1 ||| I just don't think that Red Lobster is in my wheelhouse. It used to be that they were the go-to place, but that has been in different cities. To their credit, this location is much, much friendlier and more intimate than the one on Independence in Matthews. But it's still the same place.\n\nThough it's a largish restaurant on the inside, there are mostly tables for two and four  - if you take a group in, you're going to have to wait. And probably wait some more. Probably best to go with a smaller party.\n\nThe service here is also a step (or several) above that in Matthews. The food could be the same, or several, above - since we were never even served in Matthews, it's tough to say. They did a fine job here, just know what you're getting into and you'll do fine.\n\nOnce the place was made over, it came out of the 80s vibe that had haunted them and updated it well enough, and the menu selections aren't bad - but getting seafood in Charlotte is definitely hit-or-miss. You may just want to save that for a trip to the beach.
4 ||| I Really love their bagels! They are so fresh and yummy. Great breakfast sandwiches and bagels!!! I really love the Arizona one. Plus they give you an extra bagel if you order a dozen. Great location and across the road is a really great gelato place too!
4 ||| The food here is fantastic along with the chips and salsa. The service is good as well. The dining area is very open a lot more like a bar than a restaurant. It's a great place to go to watch the game and have some food and drinks. Their bar has a nice selection of hard liquor but only a couple beers on draft. Overall it's a decent experience for a decent price.
0 ||| The only reason they get 3 starts is because of the selection and good prices. However, I can't believe someone would actually compliment the customer service. I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion but seriously? What customer service??? They never offer any assistance and when you ask them any type of question they just look at you like you're an idiot or like you are bothering them. This happens every time I go in there! Whether it be me or someone else who is asking a question. The associates act as if they could care less and are not helpful in any way.
4 ||| When we came to Kabuto for lunch on Saturday we had in tow a couple of sad kids who had just been dealt a little bad news.  So we drove to one Japanese steak house for lunch; closed until 5:00.  Looking on our phones for a new place to go, we found Kabuto.  We got there just in time to take advantage of the lunch menu.  The kids had a ball, and very soon their troubles were far behind them.  Our chef made them laugh, and they devoured their meal.  Truthfully, I've had better Hibachi.  It was really good food, but I have had better in comparison to other places.  But when my little ones go into a restaurant with frowns on their faces and come out laughing and happy, I gotta give the place credit.  We'll definitely be back.  It was an enjoyable experience!
3 ||| Don't do much grocery shopping but enjoy going in from time to time with my husband, I'm lucky that he loves to cook and usually picks up groceries as needed.  Smiths always has deals, if you are looking to save, they have great 10 for $10 deals, so you can stock up or just pick up a few.  \n\nNot my usual place to shop, we usually do westside, but this was on the way and well, it's fun to try someplace new.  It seems a bit crowded, but still has the great stuff I see at other smiths.  The neighborhood is not your safest, but the store is clean and well kept. Friendly staff and customer service.
4 ||| Do you enjoy sushi and I mean great sushi?\n\nDo you like traditional Japanese surroundings without the Las Vegas pomp and circumstance?\n\nDo you like impeccable service and an overall feeling of being welcomed like you really belong?\n\nIf this even remotely stirs your interest GO TO Tokyo. It is a true gem and until something drastic happens my new home for sushi in Las Vegas. Ignore where it is located (emptied out strip mall) and take the plunge. One of the sushi chefs is Stacey and they plain just treat you right.\n\nWe had numerous rolls, sushi and sashimi and all of them were of biblical proportions fresh and spot on. They serve you complementary edamame and miso soup...also sitting at the sushi bar they had various handouts at no charge, sliced mushrooms on a sizzling skillet huge piece of salmon skin an bones with meat that was easily picked off and melt in your mouth yummy (piece was broiled)...just AWESOME!\n\nCan't say enough about this joint...try it you will not be sorry...I promise!
2 ||| Just based on my opinion: Bashas is crap...Safeway is good, but tends to be expensive...Albertson's, meh...Food City, ICK!...AJ's is fabulous (if you're a millionaire-don't get me wrong, I like to buy a couple items on occasion, but you need serious moola to shop there on a regular basis). Out of all the grocery stores I could shop at I choose Fry's. I've been to several in the Valley & I like this one the best. It's especially nice that we live practically right next door.   \n\nThis Fry's was re-modeled awhile back & definitely looks more updated than a lot of the others. Most of the employees have genial dispositions with the exception of a couple crab-balls (eh...every store is gonna have them). A decent selection of groceries, great prices, and regular discounts make this my favorite grocery store.
4 ||| I'm not the biggest fan of Arby's but if I were to frequent one, this is the one to go to. Very well managed, clean, and chock full of friendly, well-dressed employees. Seriously, you would think that their entire crew is made up of all managers. Everyone (on the front line at least) are dressed in shirts and ties. Orders are quick and easy. You give 'em your name and they call it out when your food is ready. \n\nOn to the meals...I used to work at Hardee's as a teen, so I used to see what exactly a roast beef carcass looked like before it was cooked. It was not a pretty sight at all. So, I bite my tongue and order one here every once in awhile. They're actually pretty tasty. The best way to go is The French Dip. I don't like my bread toasted because I swear it scrapes the bejesus out of my lips. I don't even use that cup o' grease...I mean, the au jus. I just like the beef and swiss. Arby's sauce and horseradish are a must. Chicken sandwiches are better than Mickey D's or that horrid place called Burger King, but not as good as Wendy's or Chik Fil A. (Zaxbys is king!) Never tried their chicken fingers here.\n\nSides are either fries (pretty good), onion rings (too thick), or potato cakes (meh).\n\nDrinks are self-serve, as they should be. Their Jamocha Shakes are no longer as good as they once were. They taste more like a regular chocolate shake. Forget about the apple/cherry turnovers. I think they have Otis Spunkmeyer or Pepperidge Farms make them now these days. \n\nParking is plentiful but entering and exiting is a headscratcher for those unfamiliar with the area.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter
2 ||| I went in with fairly neutral expectations, ready to be wow-ed or very disappointed. Sakana is mediocre--some things done well, others not. Our waitress, although thorough and attentive, made me feel really rushed. The 50 cent appetizer deal is awesome, and the fried scallops are great! (I love all things fried--their 50 cent appetizer menu is awesome for other fried food fanatics). The sushi tasted pretty good, but felt a bit soggy and fell apart. The teppanyaki steak was absolutely delicious, but the chef did not do any tricks or anything interesting. He just chopped up our food, cooked it, and calmly placed it on our plates. I'm used to flames and excitement when I go to a teppanyaki place. Their birthday song is pretty funny--a loud drum, a Japanese birthday song, ice cream, and a Good Fortune cat are enough to embarass almost anyone! All in all, decent food but mediocre service. I'll probably do take out if I bother with this place again.
3 ||| I must have missed something the other reviews got about the Squirrel Cafe. Granted, we stopped in for lunch on Saturday so maybe it is more interesting in the evening. It struck me as a diner with a bar in it. The food was mediocre (homemade cheese dip is not cheese you put in salsa and melt in the microwave) and the pepperoni roll, while good, was tiny. Beer selection in bottles was good but the draft selection was limited. The Squirrel Cafe seemed like a little mom and pop place. Character can only get you so far. You need to have a reason to come back and, for me, neither the food or the beer selection was enough.
1 ||| Taking off a star because of the surprise delivery charges.
3 ||| Ate here with a small group from work mid week for lunch.\nOrdered the Green corn tamales.  I don't find these often enough and order them whenever I find them.  Very good.\nSevice was good, knowledgeable.  \nAmbiance was fine.  The place is a local chain, i believe, but it is good.
1 ||| friendly but slow service...very dirty furniture, surfaces and fixtures, and food that is just so-so
4 ||| Bad Attitude is awesome!  They have great quality corsets and a ton of other fun items to wear...accessories, shoes, pantyhose, costumes, and the prices are great!  The staff is always so friendly and fun! :)
4 ||| They made a small mistake on our order for which they went above and beyond to fix it. It was more than necessary and unexpected. The Kung pow chicken is great!
3 ||| A little pricy if you want something in a nontraditional size, but other than that, this place is great. Friendly and helpful staff, great location, and fast.
2 ||| SoHo clearly relies on the Pirates crowd across the street, and Steelers and Pitt games. When there's a game, the place is packed. Other times, it doesn't seem so busy. The food has been OK. It's generally bar food, with an effort to be more. Execution is varied. \n\nTry the seasoned tuna sandwich with a side of parmesan risotto; just tell them how you want the tuna cooked because they don't seem to know and will overcook it.
4 ||| Okay, THIS place is the bomb-diggity!!! They are pretty reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you and oh... the food! Super delicious!! I've had a few different things there now and I'm NEVER let down!! Their French Onion soup is delicious and the cobb salad was outstanding! My ex always get their 4 cheese macaroni and LOVES it!!! You can NEVER go wrong with Wally's!!!!! :-)
0 ||| Ate dinner there last night.  This has been my \"Go to\" place when I can't figure out what I want but don't want to cook for years now.  In fact, when I moved to Scottsdale for a year, I would drive back here for the Shrimp Fried Rice.  \n\nLast night, I noticed that the menu was different, in fact, they gave me a new one.  This doesn't bother me, as change is good if your improving things.  Sadly, not the case here.  I purchased the Mongolian beef and friend dumplings.  The dumplings were overly doughy and the Mongolian beef was in a clear, almost water like, sauce.  Not expecting this, I spilled it all over.  That's not their fault, I should have been on my toes.  The food was \"Meh\" when all was said and done.\n\nthe reason for the low star rating instead of a 3 is I got violently ill last night.  I can't say with 100% certainty that it was because of dinner here, but chances are...  I can count the number of times I have been violently ill in the past 10 years on one hand.  It's enough of a scare that I wont be back for a long time.
1 ||| Pros:\nFood was pretty good, bartenders were attentive and the prices are average for Scottsdale.  \n\nCons:\nPlace is crawling with senior citizens and our conversation was interrupted by a very loud public trivia game hosted by the staff. No one seemed to be playing and it was hard to relax with a loud woman blasting her voice over her microphone.
1 ||| Ordered my food, then about 5-10 minutes later the manager started apologizing for delay and warning customers that food might be further delayed. He communicated the delay but didn't give any timeframe. 20 minutes later, customers started getting food. I got a refund without an issue and the manager was very apologetic. Great manager but unfortunate situation that was very frustrating.
3 ||| So we had to try their burgers, everyone on base in California says they are comparable to In-N-Out, so we of course had to give them a chance!! We ordered a number one with cheese and a jalapeno burger with the fries and drink combo. These two meals cost us $14... We get our food and I was actually impressed with how large the burgers were. However, this food tasted like McDonalds... Actually I would have rather gone there because at least we would not have paid $14 for two cheeseburger combos. No thank you.. Greasy, lacking flavor, and the exact same pickles and fries as their ugly neighbor McDonalds. I think I will stick to In-N-Out. Thanks anyways though...
3 ||| Great Pizza & Wing special. Always
4 ||| Hard to find unless you know where it is (mysterious sounding, I know).  Staff is friendly.  Large selection of alcoholic beverages.  Good food.  Good prices.  Stop by if you get the chance.
0 ||| Meat was very hard like rubbery. Ordered large but it seems like small portion...just in a big bowl. Ordered egg rolls and they came out all burned. Don't go here.  Not worth the money.
4 ||| best fried chicken in charlotte.
4 ||| It's hard to argue with the delicious, fresh coffee and the never-ending parade of fresh baked treats coming from the modest little coffeehouse at the edge of the Lebo shopping district. I can happily while away a half-workday, sipping mug after tall mug of their house roasts while utilizing the wi-fi that has become as much a part of coffeehouse decor as the vintage seating.\n\nI like to set up shop towards the back, away from the cold outdoors but more importantly right by the kitchen where the bakers are outdoing themselves several times an hour. Biscotti, banana bread and pumpkin bread, coffee cake with huge nut pieces, and about 439 kinds of cookie emerge and never disappoint.
3 ||| I loves me some Sa-Bai Thong.  I might love it as much as I love Vientiane Palace, and that's saying something.  \n\nThey've redecorated recently, and it's very pretty.  In the past, it was not so much with the pretty.  But now you feel like you're having a fancy, lavish dining experience, even if you're only paying $10-15 for dinner.  That is a feeling I can get behind.\n\nI love their Curry Fried Rice.  It is SO good.  This, above all else, is what I would recommend that you try first at Sa-Bai Thong.  I always get tofu, but whatever, pick your favorite protein.  I've had a few other things, but none are as good as this dish (obviously, since I can't remember what they are).\n\nThe waitstaff is beyond courteous and pleasant.  They deliver, which is a bonus.  Things can be a little bit slow, but not too bad overall.
2 ||| Beautiful \"space\", as the gallery attendants call it.  Which you are free to take pictures of, but not the art itself.  Fair enough.\n\nThat said, this place didn't do much for me.  It's more empty space than it is art, it would seem.  There were some very cool pieces in their galleries, but I didn't feel compelled to move through the rooms in order to discover said pieces.
1 ||| would not suggest you go here if you are on a tight budget i went to get just a basic wash done (exterior only) yea it turns out they require at least one special upgrade to go through so i did it because my lexus was really dirty from the dust storm and all the rain the previous day the car came out good cant complain there but come on just wanted to go in and out thats it wtf
3 ||| I usually go to the Walgreens that's closer to my house, but today I was near this one and decided to stop by and pick up some Dove Dark Chocolate Candy for the Better Half.  It is her Birthday today and one of her favorite things is Dove Dark Chocolate.\n\nI can count on Walgreens to be able to provide me the awesomeness that will make me a hero for today.  Since she had to work on her Birthday, I thought I'd surprise her with some of these bad boys and another one of her favorites.\n\nWill I return?  To this location, only when I'm nearby.
3 ||| Great hole in the wall Chinese restaurant.....got my fix for chinese food....been going here for years n still great place to eat.
2 ||| Not too good, not too bad.  My husband and I ordered the salt & pepper calamari, clams in black bean sauce and sesame chicken.  The calamari was pretty good, a little overrated but came out nice and crispy w/ salt and red pepper seasoning and some sliced Serrano peppers that were hella spicy.  The clams in black bean sauce wasn't that good, the sauce was super salty (we ordered it after reading all the rave reviews on it).  The sesame chicken was good, it's our safe go to dish whenever we eat Chinese food.  Our bill came out to $47.24 including a HongKong iced tea that was never refilled, a little disappointing since it cost $3.75.  Perhaps I'm just cheap but I'm used to paying $2.50~ for iced tea w/ unlimited refills.  Another disappointment was the cleanliness, lots of dust on the wood window sills along the restaurant.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  Better get to cleaning before Darcy Spears hits them up and they end up on Action 13 new's Dirty Dining!  Eeeks.
3 ||| I've never had a bad room at the Omni and I've always enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  It's in a great location and with the \"T\" up the road you can get virtually anywhere you need to go fast and for free. This was my 4th stay at the Omni and over all it was just as great of an experience as always.\n\nI love that I know what to expect for parking, the garage across the street is $5 every time you leave. I also know I will not receive a complimentary breakfast, but hey there's a Starbucks so I can live with that! The rooms are always clean and staff is somewhat pleasant (about what you expect at a fancier hotel).\n\nBut employees/managers of the Omni William Penn please explain to me why you have now decided to charge your customers $10-$15 to use the WIFI on top of the large some of money they pay just to sleep in your comfy beds? I can get free WIFI at a Super 8, at a Comfort Inn, at the Cambria Suites, or basically any hotel or motel in America. \n\nYou've always been a 5-star hotel. But I feel like you did me wrong this time.
1 ||| My flight was cancelled and had to stay. They offered a \"distressed rate\" and the staff was nice and friendly. However the rooms are from the 1980's. The furniture looks like it belongs n a Motel Six. The carpets are frayed, the walls and doors are beat up, the hallway carpets are in need of replacing. Upper management should be ashamed to have not upgraded the rooms years ago.
0 ||| This place is a ripoff don't buy here they probably stay open because of their friends nobody is ever working in the back
0 ||| BOOOOO! HISSSSSSS! I called this place up and asked how much an eye exam was, guy on the phone quoted me $78 (he worked at the Lenscrafter, not at the Optometrist) - when at my appointment they tell me basic eye exam is $94 - wah?! They said that the doctor and the Lenscrafter store are not affiliated with one another(even though they are in the same store) - I understand how there was a miscommunication, but they needs to coordinate with each other better....this along with being made to wait almost 45 minutes before being seen mades me grumpy and surly, so I threw a tantrum and left for the Vision Center at Walmart where I was treated much much better, eye exam there was $65 (just for glasses, for contacts it's an additional $30) not to mention the frames at Walmart were much less expensive (some less than half the cost) plus I just walked in without an appointment and had to wait less time than I did at Lenscrafters with an appointment!\n\nI won't ever go into another Lenscrafters again, I'll stick with Walmart
0 ||| So today I took my Tahoe in for a detail here they did a decent job I checked my truck for anything of value before I left it due to having my jawbone Bluetooth,maglight and charger end up missing in the past all on different occasions today I knew I had $3 on the ashtray iPod connector and misc. coins. Three hours later I show up my truck looks ok after checking for the items I mention they are all gone!!! I can't believe these people I confront them about it but its like they don't care. They also wet my bass processor and is now useless this after they washed my carpet. I think this has done it for me no more Splash Car Wash worst place ever. Partially my fault for coming back after they stole from me the first time. Stay away!!
4 ||| All I can say is WOW.  I was in Fountain Hills with family for Memorial Day and needed a good Mexican food joint and Senor Taco was it and more.  Walked in and was greeted by possibly the owner and immediately felt welcome. I  had trouble deciding what to order because they have it all.  Decided on the Diablo shrimp burrito and it was delicious with all the flavors i was hoping for.  The others I went with loved their food and of course the margaritas were refreshing in the Arizona heat. Prices are a steal especially for the fountain Hills area.  \n\nIf your visiting from out of town and unsure where to go, this is a no brainer.
0 ||| Worst drive-thru I've ever been to, mostly because in the three times I gave this sorry excuse for a restaurant a chance, twice it screwed up!  The first time they didn't give me half my food and I had to go back for the rest.  The second time we pulled up to the drive-thru with three hours to spare and sat there for three minutes waiting for someone to come to the speaker.  When they didn't, I tried to go in to order food.  THE DOORS WERE LOCKED!  Yet when someone else approached the window they instantly took their order!  Complained to corporate, which trickled down to regional, which got passed to the restaurant itself.  Their response?  Basically \"Oh well.  We don't give a crap.\"  I give you two tries then that's it.  Don't bother with this place.  Seriously.
1 ||| Sorry reviewers this restaurant is no match for Lotus of Siam. Everything fine at Komal-great service, cleanliness, good food but no match for Lotus of Siam. So disappointed after reading what the Wall Street Journal had to say.
2 ||| Bait and switch: Spoke with service manager who said initially that I should of been charged an additional $18.75 for extra time spent, when I told him I was charged $37.50 his story changed. So I was charged an extra half hour service fee when they came out to replace filters that they replaced for 8 years in a row with the half hour fee, now of $75, which they felt that it takes more time now to change my same filters for an additional half hour fee of $37.50.
4 ||| Great Indian food here. It's been almost 6 years ago since I've eaten here. Their buffet food never disappoints. Even their gulab jamun (the little donut hole-like dessert) tasted fresh. Unlike the ones I've had before from other Indian restaurant in the valley that was cold and stale. Everything was great!
2 ||| The place is somewhat hidden inside a village. It seems like it is more of a family restaurant.\n\nGarlic bread was served and it was salty and the garlic flavoring was overpowering.   Calamari for apettizer was not even enticing. Bland and the marinara dip was lacking in flavor, too.\n \nAnd came the entree. I made a mistake of ordering the shrimp marinara because it was the same sauce that came with the calamari. But how could i have known, we order the apettizer the same time with the entree. It was lacking that fresh italian herb and spices flavor. Although it was sprinkled with dried parsley and oregano on top. And it came with a ton of pasta! The chicken marsala was the only thing that tasted nice. \n\nI was disappointed, to say the least. It was out-of-the-freezer and out-of-the-can taste. I might as well reheat my Ragu.
4 ||| When I'm hungry for Mediterranean food in the Dilworth area, Kabob Grill is on my list. With super fresh ingredients and delicious vegetarian fare, it's definitely an easy choice for the Mr and me.\n\nI usually order the vegetarian combo, which includes items such as tabbouleh, hummus, falafel, potato harra, Omar's salad, or a plethora of other choices.\n\nThe Mr goes with the Chicken Shawarma Wrap and devours it so quickly I can't even get a good look at it!\n\nSo why only 3 stars?\n\nThe hummus is pretty boring. The prices are inflated for dinner. For reference, at Kabob Grill, a vegetarian plate and chicken shawarma wrap cost us $24 for takeout before a tip; no drinks or extras included. I have had similar meals that cost significantly less at other Mediterranean restaurants.\n\nI know it's a mainstay, and I appreciate its convenience to our home. But I wish there were a little more love put into some of the dishes...and that they didn't charge so much.
4 ||| Great place to take in the view :)
1 ||| It's ok.  Has all of your typical mall stores.  Helped me kill an evening while in Madison on business.  The food court isn't all that great.
4 ||| We love the popcorn here. Sometimes the picture isn't the greatest for the theater but overall we love to go here and get rewarded for our movie going so that is fun.
2 ||| My boyfriend and I stopped here for a Valentines Day date and we thought the place was decent. The waiters are very friendly and they explain the menu really well. They also offer great suggestions to first time customers. This was definitely a great first time experience especially for people who have never tried fondue style cooking. I thought that cooking appetizers, main course and dessert on a fondue was a very unique idea. The setting and lighting has a very romantic feel. On the other side, the prices are completely ridiculously high. You do not get a lot of food for the price. Our check was over $120 and that's a ridiculous price to pay for tiny portions of food. I would suggest this to someone who wants a romantic night in town with some experimental fondue styles but I definitely wouldn't go back for that price. For $20 we bought our own fondue pot and tried our own cheese dips, meats and desserts without the crazy expensive price.
2 ||| If you haven't travelled much, you'll definitely be impressed by this airport. Your experience will likely be heavily dependant on whether you are coming in or flying out. If you are coming in, the whole pick up situation can be pretty frustrating because there is no waiting area for your ride, so they will have to either park or continue to circle the airport until you are out. Baggage seems to take an incredibly long time here, and I don't quite understand why because they only have one claim. It's all going to the same place... anyways, if you are flying out you probably will think it's a great airport.
0 ||| Ice was choppy even after zamboni. No attendant on ice to referee reckless skaters or monitor bad falls. Kids coming out on ice in their tennis shoes. No rubber mats out, so if you brought your own skates you'd mess up the skating edge by walking on concrete. Employees seemed to be more into visiting with regulars. Session started 15 minutes late. I miss the ice rink at Metrocenter!
2 ||| Quite possibly the best fish tacos I have ever tasted....2nd only to Torchy's Tacos in TX.  The flavor was outstanding (I had one salmon taco and one tuna) and the fish was grilled to perfection.  My only complaint was that when we got our food it was lukewarm...not hot at all.  Also, I ordered the coleslaw and it was slightly flavorless.
1 ||| 10-inches of hard crust Italian bread stuffed with ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella (hold the pepperoni), provolone, hot peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing. Heaven. Great deal at only $7.95! Waaay to much sandwich for one person for lunch. \n\nThey have a lovely pastry case filled with Italian cookies, cannoli shells (and cannoli, but I prefer to make my own filling - viva Sambuca and chocolate chips!) and sfogliatelle. \n\nAisles and aisles of canned, jarred, boxed and bagged Italian pantry essentials (and they're not covered in dust like some other places). \n\nKeep an eye on the prices. Some are fair - Polly-O brand is hard to come by in the Valley but others are practical extortion! ($20 for Illy espresso!!?)
1 ||| Dear Pizza Hut,  your dough is just horrible please take a page from Dominos and scrap what you're doing and get back in the game.   Tonight's pizza was just a mess.   Half went to the trash.   And that's only because we were so disgusted that we shared it with a less discriminating friend.  I can't believe I actually like this stuff as a kid.   Was it always this bad?  I'd like to think not,  but seriously, just stop it...jokes over.   I'm giving 2-stars only because the employees seemed to be on point and I had no issue there.
4 ||| If you want a non national chain processed burger Lennys is for you! A small whole in the wall ma and pa shop with great fresh food .. been coming here since high school and it has memories .. the food never disappoints and the shakes are AMAZING .. triple teriyaki burger combo MHM! ! The same people have been working there for 7 + years!
4 ||| When we originally went in to the Room Store, we were greeted by one of the sales people.  I do not recall the gals name that approached us when we walked in.  But we told her what we were looking for.  She basically pointed us in the direction we needed and said, if you have any questions..come find me.   Uhh..okay.  We'll come find you.   \n\nWell, we had questions after a few minutes and this woman was no where to be found.  After I walked the store for about 10 minutes and still was not finding our sales gal - I ran into Tommy.  *church organ and choir singing*\n\nI had had enough with trying to find our sales gal and we starting dealing with Tommy.  He answered all our questions on the sectional and we then informed him that we were also looking for a king size mattress.  \n\nNo sooner than we get into the mattress area, the original sales gal approaches all of us and was like....\"I've been looking all over for you guys.\"  I wanted to say, 'Yeah fucking right..cause I walked around 10 minutes looking for you!\"  I instead informed her that we were doing business for Tommy.  She walked away with a pissed look on her face.  I would have looked pissed too knowing that I blew a few K's sale cause I was in the back room or where ever doing whatever!  \n\nA week later we returned to purchase our sectional and mattress saving $1200 in the process (thanks to price matching on the sectional and a sealy optimum sale going on - king for a queen!)\n\nOutstanding customer service from Tommy.  The delivery guys a few days later were very helpful too, removing our old mattress and offering to move our old couch and loveseat into the carport (it was scheduled to be picked up by a charity the next day).  \n\nWe'll definitely return when we're in the need of furniture!!
4 ||| wonderful, the best greek food.
2 ||| Very long wait (even though we arrived early and there were few waiting), extremely slow service, food was tasty though.
4 ||| Okay 5 stars because they are the alternative to Filibertos style food, without the Filibertos taste.\n\nIts pretty clean and they have a nice salsa bar.  Menu is a little cluttered but they have many combos and different types of items.  If you are lost, order a carne asada burrito.  if u dun like guacamole, order a green chili burrito (pork with green sauce)  real good.\n\nwhat else do i like about this place, price wise, its very comparable to most fast food and mexican fast food places.  U order at the front, pay and get your own food and drinks and bus the trays after.  \n\nits also 24 hours, so whats not to like ?
3 ||| I have been to this noodle cafe many times and love love their Ramen. Their TanTanMen is very good and very hot. I like their Shrimp Shumai too.  The sushi is OK but I don't go there for that.
3 ||| No doubt lots of good reviews on Gaetanos. Just went there for the first time. More formal and maybe 'upscale' than I thought it would be (double contrasting tablecloths, candles, wine glasses pre-set, waiters in ties, etc.). Nice decor, just not what I was expectin.. But enough of that, we were there to eat. The menu was OK. Basic staples of Italian not to be found,,,Spag and Meatballs, Chicken Parm, and others) This was more of an upscale menu (and prices), just like the decor. Lot's of veal, lot's of 'specials'. We got Bolognese and Chicken Marsala. Overall, we thought it was OK, but with so many good Italian restaurans in H-Son, did not seem to stand above, or equal to many. Nice to try once, but not for us. Service was good.
4 ||| Baba Ganoush and Dolmas are yummy. \n\nGET THE GROUND BEEF KABOB SANDWICH. Its not on the menu but you can request it. It's delicious and so filling, I prefer the pita over the wrap for choice of bread but its whatever you like.
2 ||| Not bad food. But not great either.
3 ||| I have been in and out of this airport for years. And never once did I realize that the terminal is equipped with free wifi. Every single time I come here, I always plug in my air data card only to watch it crap out after 15 minutes and then reboot so that I can get back on line.\n\nWell right now as of this writing, I am online and taking full advantage of the free wifi here. \n\nMy flight is delayed.\n\nMy Starbucks hot cocoa tastes odd (all airport Starbucks taste funny)\n\nThe airport provides H1N1 flu shots on the departure level. \n\nThe smell of the Nathans Hot Dog stand is very inviting.
0 ||| The girls here are easy, the venue is dirty and this is not where you want to go when you are in Las Vegas. It was not appealing. Dont expect any of your needs to be met here. Unless you are a dirty bastard.
4 ||| +++Band on a Monday night\n+++++Delicious wings\n+++++$2.00 Beers\n+++Magic Johnson's Shroomer Burger\n+++++Cobb Salad\n\nAll the food here is amazing. Fun environment, great set-up. Really as good as it gets. It looks like they have great lunch specials too. I met my Dad and his flight crew here after they flew in from Chicago. They loved it! They met some friendly Aussies before I got there so it turned into a party.\nI didn't try the big unit, but it was fun to hear the bell ring every time the waiter brought one out. Maybe next time. Great service- very fast.
0 ||| Craplicious.  I booked this hotel because I had a meeting down in the UPMC medical center.  The location couldn't be beat, right near downtown with walking distance to campus and all of the great college type restaurants in the area.  Past this I wasn't too impressed.  The hotel was a bit dreary and the internet didn't work initially (kind of important on a business trip), but the maintenance guy forgoed the whole internet box and connected me directly into the wall which worked great.  \n\nI had a tough time getting to sleep because my bedroom faced the gas station.  Aside from the time difference, I had hoodlums driving in and out of the gas station all night long blaring their hoodlum music the whole time they were filling up their hoodlum cars with gas.  Lame.
3 ||| I live around the corner and find that it's a nice corner bar but the service is hit or miss ranging from good to abysmal. Not that anyone is rude; they're simply overwhelmed and understaffed at times. \n\nGood bar food, good beer, cozy place. Wish I could give them a better rating.
4 ||| I'm glad that I finally found yet another pizzeria that offers gluten-free options for pizza and other items. The gluten-free pizza crust is made by GFC (Gluten Free Creations, one of my fave GF establishments in the city). Tucked in a quiet commercial strip, the place has a very casual vibe and very friendly service. The sauce tends to lean a bit toward the sweet side, but pleasantly so, in my opinion. Nice to know that I have a cool place to reward myself after a hike at nearby Lookout Mountain.
0 ||| UW Health Monona is the worst clinic in the world. I finally left after waiting an hour to see my doctor. They are incompent and don't care how much of their patients time they waste
0 ||| After seeing all the good reviews and seeing the sign saying they have been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives we were pretty excited to try this place. We had attempted to try out Waffles INCaffinated, but the wait was 1.5 hours. \nWe ate here on a fairly busy Sunday morning, there was no real room to wait while they were cleaning the table, and every time the door opened the cook?/owner?/maybe manager? would yell \"CLOSE THE DOOOORR!!!!\", as loud as he possibly could. \nWhen we sat down, it took at least ten minutes for someone to come give us menus. I ordered coffee (the menu cites only one free refill ,which is weird). The breakfast menu was way smaller than anticipated. If you don't want eggs for breakfast, definitely don't come here. Our order was fairly simple (as there aren't many options), but our food took at least 45 minutes to come. When it finally did, it did not all come together but rather very staggered over many ten minutes or so. I got an egg english muffin sandwich which was extremely comparable to what I could have made at home. Does not come with anything...Nothing was remarkable.. plates, mugs and silverware did not exactly look the cleanest. There was definitely some crusty stuff on the rim of my coffee mug. \nAnnnnyway, wasn't thrilled. Prices are VERY cheap, but you get what you pay for...Will not be back.
1 ||| I done with Gilbert Peds. I have been taking my daughter to the Greenfield and Baseline office since she was born, six years ago. And this week was the straw that broke the camels back. Never, not once in all these years have they ever been on time. Not even when I've sent my husband to take our daughter. We were in the office on Friday and needed to return on Tuesday. Arrived at 3:20 for a 3:30 appointment, didn't get into our room until 4:15. After telling the nurse of my frustrations the doctor was in our room by 4:25. I understand that doctors can't anticipate how long an unexpected diagnosis might take, but I've given 6 years of excuses for this office---it just comes down to a poorly run office. Not to mention the office itself is uninviting and not very kid friendly. Used dirty childrens books in the rooms and LDS materials for adult.
4 ||| I visited this place when I was on a business trip to Phoenix. My colleague and me walked out our office on a moderately warm day and were looking to grab a bite to eat.\n\nWe wandered across the street from the office into the Biltmore Mall (supposedly an upscale mall) but could not find anything to our liking.\n\nWe looked across the street and saw The Capital Grill and decided to venture into it. It is a very nice restaurant and is very tastefully decorated. Was not sure of the food when we sat down to order.\n\nI looked at the Menu and decided to have the \"Lobster & Crab Burger\". Also ordered hand made fries with it (what the heck). If the lobster and crab were not going to clog my arteries, I was sure that the fries would do the trick!!\n\nWas a little skeptical but my colleague also ordered the same. We looked a each other and thought that at $19 a pop for a burger it better be good.\n\nFirst the fries came. Not sure if it was the hunger that was clouding the judgement but the fries were presented very nicely and were cut thin and crispy as I like it. So far so good.\n\nThe the well dressed butler (yes) served the burger with a bow and whispered \" Enjoy you meal sir\" lightly into my ears. \n\nThe burger was open faced with one half of the burger bread outside and the other half had this nice looking chunk of lobster and crab cake blended with Old Bay seasoning with a side of freshly prepared tartar sauce. \n\nI tell you this was the best tasting crab & lobster cake I have ever had. It just melted in my mouth and I kind of licked the plate dry. It was the highlight of my day after half a day of meetings (well I need to 'fess that the other highlight was the ICC World Cup Match that I watched from 2:00 AM  - 9:00 AM).\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this place. I am definitely coming back here on my next business trip.
0 ||| I love pizza but was really disappointed with this place.  We ordered the combination Deluxe pizza w/Italian sausage, mushrooms, mozzarella and hot peppers.  The pizza was pretty bland and tasteless and the hot peppers turned out to be pepperoncini peppers (the yellow sweet/tangy peppers) not hot at all.  And what's with \"Taco Pizza\"?  I saw this on their menu and was completely puzzled and a little grossed out.  Why this combination when there are so many other worthwhile combos??  I've been told it's a mid-western thing.  Mid-western or not, it's just wrong.
4 ||| First time here today, went there for take out, there was no minimum order required.  I had the black pepper beef.  It was really good, better than I had expected.  This will be my new place for Chinese food!! The lady working the counter was real nice and helpful pick out something.  Keep up the good work!!
2 ||| this is the whitest restaurant i have ever eaten at in my life. first off the salsa is a essentially a can of corn with half a tomato on top. same with the rice and beans i ordered as a side. white rice with no flavor and what taste like store brand black beans straight from the can dumped on top. nothing had any flavor including the decor and the underenthusiastic waitress and the bland local art on the walls. i dont care if it is by a local artist its still a gosh darn painting of bob marley.
4 ||| What can i say about this spot...I love it, have seen some of the best rockabilly there is! And some kick ass blues along the way. This is defiantly a good date takin place, because the music is always lusty and makes you wanna grind on someone in a slow good not slutty way! and if you are single there are always a boatload of pretty people to look at... this reminds me of going back in time whenever i can go see a good show here...
1 ||| This was an ok place to grab a quick bite, but it appears they have closed down and are no longer in business.
4 ||| My BMW was rear-ended and in need of a new trunk, bumper, and side paneling. After doing some thorough research I decided to go with Scott's Coach Works and could not have been happier. The staff was very friendly, and they kept me informed with the process the whole time. I would definitely recommend SCW!
4 ||| This place was recommended to us about, twenty miles away?\nThe loyal following is out of the local area. So we had to check this place out.\n\nThe building:\nThe Hobo does live up to its theme; when you find it you will know it. \nThe inside is the standard dinner area, also the preferred seating for a hobo. Featuring large areas to set down, stretch out and down your jacket and bags. You can easily sit for more than twenty minutes and not worry about being run out (to make room for more customers).\n\nThe food:\nAny hobo would like this style of dining. Lots of different things, so you will not get tired of eating a lot at once. Also the shear amount will fill you up since a lot of hobos do not eat three meals a day. Again, you are not pressured to finish fast. This makes it much easier to finish the large portions the Hobo has to offer.\n\nThis place would kill a Denny's, without even trying. Since I am not from the local area it is hard to compare it to anything locally.\nYea, I would eat here again.
2 ||| I've visited Taylor's Cafe off and on over the last few years, it's been months since I've been in but finally decided to write a little something. \nTaylor's is tucked away among a few other local businesses. You may need to look around to actually find it. Hint: park in the back parking lot/east parking lot, you'll have no problem spotting it from there.\n\nGo for the fresh squeezed Orange Juice. They squeeze it per glass, and go for the Victor Ostrovsky Art, and also if you're a fan of supporting local businesses. Give up on IHOP and Denny's, forget the \"fad\" \"big breakfast\" places and give a neighborhood place a try.\n\nI've generally visited early in the morning, before the \"brunch crowd\" and have had exceptional service and food.
3 ||| Great service until today, they serve our dealership everyday and is usually great... Today the (new) lady driver saw that the 6 Washbay kids had food and, as I was walking up to order, started the truck and left. We have a whole sales force to feed.... Wasn't here for 5min. What's up with that?
0 ||| This place is a train wreck in a refrigerator. Its very cold (which is to be expected) but also extremely dilapidated. The ceiling is falling in, its old and worn, and worst of all, there is NO ONE to control the children.  The children (which are more like teenagers) are running a muck, creating cracks in the ice and throwing it at other people. \n\nI don't like the ice throwing, and I don't like cold ceilings falling in. When asked if you should go to Arcadia say, \"No!\"
4 ||| Stopped for lunch- I love the atmosphere! Great food too.. I had the Mini Tamale and Mini Cubano --my boyfriend got the regular Cuban sandwich- it was HUGE! They are very generous with the servings. I will definitely be back! Service was great too- they always came back to check the drinks, always a plus!
3 ||| I've been going to this place for a few years now.  I've gotten the chai latte every time.  Its pretty good, I'm not really that picky on the quality of my tea yet.  This review is based mainly on the venue itself.  I really like the atmosphere here and there are always tons of people here.  I took off one star because the internet can get slow if its packed and sometimes it can be too packed.
0 ||| This place is the pits. Over an hour to get an oil change. What's worse there was one guy in the shop and he hurt his leg while doing a brake job. The only response from the manager was, \"Do I have to tell you to clean up your mess again?\" I'm not coming here again.
4 ||| I was glad I found this place because it is the only gun shop with any inventory right now. They were the only store in the valley to have what I was looking for. The prices are great, while every other shop has increased their prices dramatically with the decreased availability. \n\nThe employee I spoke to was a bit gruff but he knew what he was talking about. He did spout off a lot of hatred about the American public for some reason so I kind of just awkwardly laughed along with his comments. If the phone is busy, they are really busy inside and left the phone off the hook intentionally; I've seen another place do this which sucked since I had tried calling all day to figure out their hours.\n\nThe shop is located in a crappy strip mall where there is almost nothing else in business so it's easy to miss, but for the selection and prices I'd recommend it.
4 ||| How is it that I, a meat and potato lover, am just now finding this\"boxty\"? It was amazing! I had the Steak & Guinness Stout Boxty and it was incredible. Nice pieces of tender steak, mushrooms, rich gravy, and a crispy shredded potato cake on top. Amazing. My wife had the beef stew and she said it was very good - nice sized serving and she couldn't eat it all. Nice authentic feeling Irish pub feel. I recommend this place.
4 ||| If i have to choose between this location and the one on 43rd Ave. It has to be this one..  \n\nWhy?  Because here, they get your drink out in literally 2min or less.  Im not dogging the other location because they do great on the drinks, but my God.. you can spend 20min in the drive-thru at times. \n\nIf you want fast, friendly and awesome service, this place kicks all kinds of ass. :)
3 ||| I just recently stayed at the Arizona grand resort with my husband and three kids along with two other families. We all really had a great time !  Our two bedroom suite was perfect overlooking the lobby and golf course.  We all had plenty of space to relax and the beds were incredibly comfortable.  \nI must commend the staff at the lobby grill - Martin,Buffy and bill. We had breakfast almost every day of our stay and they were all so welcoming and attentive to our needs\nAt the oasis water park, where we spent most of our days, the staff was just as accommodating and helpful - in particular Samantha and kady.  \nI took a few spin classes led by Stuart and I must say his passion and dedication to teaching spin really has influenced me to take spin classes when I got home. \nAll in all it was a great time had by all.  \nThe only recommendations I would say would be more snacks available at the waterpark, more variety at the market deli in the lobby shop and would be great to have a park where the kids could play.
4 ||| Had the jolly green giant omelet. Talk about delicious vegetable galore! Also, I subbed toast for the banana nut bread and I was not disappointed. I could definitely see myself coming here tomorrow.
4 ||| I've been here plenty of times for the past few years for wedding receptions, dim sum and of course MY wedding reception.\n\nWe came here last night for a wedding reception and we LOVE the food here. The seafood appetizer and the seafood soup to start are delicious. The seafood platter includes, Jelly Fish (YUM), Seaweed Salad, Squid and a few other items. It looks a little weird, but it's very tasteful. The soup was GREAT, it had great taste to it. For entrees we had, stir fried crabs (LOVE LOVE LOVE!), a whole roasted chicken, whole roasted duck, stir fry beef and Chinese broccoli, a whole steamed catfish, pork fried rice, and fried quail. Everything was delicious. I never really liked quail, it just looks unappetizing. My husband insisted I try just a little piece cause he said it taste just like chicken so I thought why not try just a small piece. I must admit it did taste like chicken but it was a little too salty for me. \n\nI highly recommend this place if you're looking for some real authentic Chinese food. Dim sum is great as well!
4 ||| My fiance' bought my engagement ring here, and he said the experience was great. They didn't try to oversell him, but instead, found out what his budget was, and only showed him diamonds in that price range, of all qualities.  We both went in a few weeks ago to order our wedding bands, and the process was very painless.  They were able to grab a band that I loved from the back. Don't assume that what you see in front of you is all they have, the cases can only hold so much.  Just ask.  These guys do a great job to satisfy their customers, and they make it such an easy process.  Good work!
0 ||| I have to warn everyone to stay away from doing business with this Regus office! They are owned by a large International firm and will nickel and dime their clients. Just google Regus and you will see what I'm talking about. The employees at the office are very competent and nice but they are not empowered to make any decisions. I just had to deal with a situation that cost me a lot of $. I was a tenant for almost 25 years at this location and I was treated like dirt when I left.
3 ||| Our first time visit today. Food was very good and service was great. !
0 ||| Tonight ... this place was HORRIBLE !!!  \nHad 3 different wait staff ... \nWe had not been sitting not 5 minutes when we were basically forced to order ... \nOrdered an appatizer ... salad and cheese bread ... the salad came out promply ... however the cheese bread did not come until AFTER the main dishes came ... and it was FREEZING cold ... could not even eat it ...\nSpeaking of cold ... the main dishes were cold as well when they came out ...\nWhen something was said and the manager came over ... she made some excuse that her pasta maker tonight \"was working extremely fast\" ... and thats why we got the cold pasta before the cold bread ... \nShe then offered us a free cookie due to it ... but why take it ? So it could come out hard as a rock with melted ice cream ... and still was charged for the bread and cold pasta ... \nIt will be an EXTREMELY long time before we ever visit here again ... \nVERY DISAPPOINTING !!!
3 ||| Good tacos. I'm a picky Mexican food eater and I don't mind their food. Nothing GREAT but I wouldn't complain. The prices are pretty cheap considering the quality, freshness and authenticity of the food\n\nI've heard many rumors that they always barely pass their health codes. Uh oh!
0 ||| Dont go here!!. This place practices sex/gender  discrimination!!  As a preface, they have no dress code posted.  They said my atire (a female) with tank top, shorts, and sandals was fine. However, my husband, who was dressed exactly the same (tank top, shorts, sandals) was not \"wearing appropriate atire\" and not allowed to dine. When we asked for the written dress code, and they said tgey had none. I pointed out there was no dress code posted at the business or on the web, and not to mention it was over 100 degrees outside, and in the desert, the manager became rude. Isnt this discrimination based on sex/gender? Dibt eat at this place if you belueve in civil rights, because they don't.
0 ||| World's messiest gift shop! Hahahahaha! Lots of cheap, generic gifts that can be found elsewhere on the Strip. Travel a little further to Fremont Street and you'll find more similar items for much cheaper. Also despite their size, there are no bathrooms for patrons.
2 ||| I can't believe it's taken me 4,762 visits to this Oregano's to finally get my lazy ass to type out a review of this place.  Perhaps it's the overall indifference, and everyday-ness quality to this place that explains.   \n\nFOOD --- 3 stars\nSERVICE --- 3.5 stars\nATMOSPHERE --- 4 stars\nPARKING --- 1 star\n\nOregano's isn't bad nor terribly good --- but it falls in the middle as an average lunch or dinner option.  Portions here are big, but quanity does not equal quality.  I find it to be infinitely better than most other Italian chains (the BARFY Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's), but not quite at the level of Maggiano's or Il Fornaio.  \n\nThe food here is OK, although there are a few standouts. \n* Alfredo the Dark pasta with the poblano peppers.  \n* Lady is a Scampi pasta\n* Pizza Cookie (or whatever it's called)\n* Italian Fried Potatoes\n\nBtw, that last item is their cutesy name for waffle fries.  Being the waffle fry whore that I am, I have to say these are quite good. \n\nThe baked sandwiches are OK --- the beefstro and stuffed turkey being one of my usual orders.  The pizza is OK as well.  Being a thin crust lover, I find the crust at Pizza Heaven and Pizzeria Bianco to have a better-tasting texture.  It's almost a little too thin (read: cheap) here.  Kind of like notebook paper.  How do I know?  Because I've tried it.  The salads here are big, so be warned.  Can't comment on the taste though because I haven't had them.\n\nThe 1950s swing/jazz motif, tomato sauce cans, and loud t-shirts can be charming in a campy kind of way. But what I like most about this location is how they preserved the \"Damen/Herren\" bathroom signs from when it used to be some kind of Bavarian wonderland.  \n\nAmong the cons here are the parking NIGHTMARE and sometimes hellish 1 hour-plus waits (on Mondays even!).  This place is ALWAYS packed.  I do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100.  They must expect all their customers to carpool together in mini-vans.  But even so, they should know that NO ONE in Central Phoenix would be caught dead in a mini-van.\n\nThe parking shortage has caused nearby businesses to post bitchy signage warning Oregano's patrons not to park there - resulting in the traffic BOOBYTRAP that is 10th St.  Drivers must dodge slowly moving cars and waddling Oregano's customers weave in and out as the tiny parking lot leaks out onto 10th.  \n\nStaff here is always quick and freakishly friendly and cheery -- kind of like the drones at Jamba Juice and Cold Stone Creamery.  It's kind of cute, but borderline annoying that it seems trite.  But there are plenty of a-holes at other restaurants so I'm not complaining.\n\nSo there you have it.  Not exactly great, but I will be back soon.  Visit 4,763 is coming up next week.\n\nP.S.  For stalkers who care, Phoenix Fire Department DOES eat here often.  In fact when Melinda sees a fire engine parked outside she always requests a table close to the firefighters.  She thinks those guys are \"en fuego.\"
4 ||| This is a must! For all you seafood lovers out there! The view is amazing, it could not get any better! The food was excellent, and an affordable price:) it was very classy, you will have to dress up~ no\njeans!
4 ||| I was shopping for a car and stopped by this dealership to check out a few of the models on their lot.  It was a Saturday afternoon and this place was packed!  I had to wait around 15 min for a salesperson to free up so I could test drive a couple of the cars I had on my list.  The receptionist was very friendly and talked to me while I waited.  She cooked up some Popcorn for the customers waiting in the lobby area and offered me some.  I wasn't in the mood for any, so I declined, but it was nice of her to offer.\n\nThe cars I test drove were ok, but they didn't \"feel like my car\", so I left empty handed.  On to the next dealership.  The shopping experience here was good and I would consider buying a car in the future from them.\n\nReturn Factor - 87%
0 ||| Pretty bummed. My dog has been using petsmart for everything.  We use Banfield.  She's loved doggy daycare. She occasionally needs a professional bath and nails trimmed. I picked her up last night she was still wet! Luckily it's hot out. She has matts in her hair! Her nails are not trimmed. I asked she said she did them. Not at all. What a waste! I now need to find a new groomer in fear this happens again.  I think she was in a rush! Regardless I paid full price and not sure what I paid for!
3 ||| I had an interesting experience here.\n\nI went to buy a suit.  Luckily, BCFW had a red tag sale going on and I found an awesome Charcoal Kenneth Cole two piece.  I was in a good mood because I figured, \"Heck, I'll land that job with this, no problem.\"\n\nAs I was leaving the dressing room, a guy from the suit section and from the Big and Tall section were having an epic battle of words about 4 feet away from me.  I was rather interested, so I stood there and observed.  I couldn't hear what it was about but the suit guy said \"shut up you #####\" and the big guy said \"don't walk away ####.\"\n\nNow, I'm a 25 year old dude, so I used language like this alot, but never in a setting like this.  Luckily, there were no kids around but I'm pretty sure thats the kinda thing parents would want to avoid.\n\nI have returned a few times after this incident and the suit guy remains an employee there while the big guy has moved on.
4 ||| I always have the tough choice of Buon Gusto, Windy City and Rosati's. They're all about 2 miles apart.  But I wouldn't throw out 4 stars to mediocre pizza. This is great pizza. I am spoiled having such great pizza so close to home.
0 ||| I went to lunch today with my family and hadn't been to this location in some time. The table had a sticky residue around the perimeter that was really unpleasant. I looked out the window and immediately saw 4 flies on the inside folks. I look down and the window sill was dirty and the white shudders were equally grimy. \n\nI ordered an iced tea wondering if I could talk my family into going somewhere else. Nope auntie wanted pie. The iced tea was not brewed. Dissaponting. I ordered the potato soup, meatball sliders and double cream lemon pie. \n\nThe soup was creamy and delicious as always. Yay! The meatball sliders, were just ok. The onions were caramelized nicely but the meatloaf was sort of grainy. If you have had mre meatloaf, it was like that. You get two, I sent one home. The pie was awesome with the tart lemon filling and lemon cream. The crust was nice and flakey.\n\nTake some time, clean your restaurant and go back to brewed iced tea. You do so well with the tired and true recipes, the meatloaf was just meh. I really hate giving you a two star but the cleanliness and the tea just really turned me off.
4 ||| Absolutely an amazing experience, just got an amazing deal on a Kate spade watch the only problem was it was a tiny bit to big (literally take out 2 links and you're good) we came here and they were decently busy but they fit us in right away took 5 min to get the links off and also they cleaned my ring! So nice and amazing work!!! Love this store!!!!
4 ||| Tasty Asian American style  food. I go there about 4 times a week. The food is always hot and fresh. Clean restaurant, not too pricey and Friendly employees,,, Deserves not less than 5 stars!
4 ||| These guys are the best, they really stick by their name \"DISCOUNT TIRES\" I come from the other side of henderson to see these guys when I need tires. They really are the best, with great prices!!
0 ||| This is the very worst native I have been to. Every time I've been there the wings are super old and gross and super chewy. I have no idea why I go back.
3 ||| They have good acts coming around here, and often give out free tickets, particularly ine summer. I've never actually paid full price for a ticket here. \n\nThe two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though...I don't mind the requirement so much, but the quality isn't good and the prices are high. Our four items total came to about $30 (two appetizers and two beers) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers aren't even very friendly. Also beware...they have a lot of rules here. They won't seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner, automatic gratuity added to the check, etc. etc.\n\nThe \"box office\" is also weird...you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don't get the whole hoopla with the window.\n\nAll in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good.
2 ||| The store had expectable service and a decent stock of tools.I had a small project in my studio that was taking place just last month and they had the right stuff.This particular shop is good stuff.
4 ||| Yep...traveling through Phoenix on way to San Fran and had a \"fender bender\" that left my car all crunched up...was told Brighton ranch body shop was the place to go...was told right about that...they did a great job. Mark and Kelly made the bad experience almost pleasant...great place to take your crunched car...they did it right...Jim
2 ||| I don't really expect much from a bar & grill and I guess that's what I got. I can't eat much and bread is off the menu. I asked for a simple hamburger patty, but the told me that I would have to pay for a whole burger with the fixings anyway. Well, okay fine. Since I'm just eating the patty I'm hoping it's nice and juicy medium as ordered. What I got was a charred hockey puck.\n\nI also got an order of fried zucchini. I expect it to be frozen stuff, but this was pretty bad and grease soaked.\n\nI realize they don't start off with super good ingredients, but they could have cooked it better and brought it out faster being that the place was dead on a late Friday night.\n\nBTW, I cannot figure out why two reviews are filtered. They seem on the up and up. The food service is painfully slow.  This is a place for beer and sports.
4 ||| I've been here several times to attend charity events in the ballroom and I'm not impressed.  The hotel is very small and oftentimes books large events that are too big for their ballroom.  The result is that the tables are crammed in too close to each other and the AC can't handle the # of people in the room, so it's hot.  That's been the case in two events I attended.\n\nTheir banquet area doesn't have cash registers that accept credit cards, so it's the antiquated swipe of your credit card on a carbon paper slip method, which slows down service dramatically....kind of crazy to think that a high end brand like the Ritz-Carlton would do that.  I'd expect that from a lower end chain, but not a top notch one.\n\nAdditionally, it's difficult to find self parking here....so do yourself a favor and valet park.\n\nThe employees here is what is preventing me from giving them 2 Stars.  The customer service here is outstanding.  Employees are very friendly and definitely meet the high standards of RC.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%
3 ||| I wasn't sure about going here. It came highly recommended but I read some reviews and they weren't great. I think the problem is that some people have unreasonable expectations, especially after having visited for myself. The food was pretty good, the portions were unusually large and the service was far above average. This is not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but nobody at my table had anything but positive to say about their menu choices. My daughter in particular had an adult-size meal that she ordered from the kids menu. I tried it. It was almost as good as my carnitas chimichanga. I hope that people wait til they are in a better mood before they write their reviews. When a place truly sucks then I could see, but this place doesn't.
0 ||| Once we got over the fact that we were in a church-turned-brewery... the whole gimmick faded and we realized that this was a pretty sub-par restaurant.\n\nFirst off, this two star rating is due to the food and service. I hesitated giving it a 3-star because the beers were pretty good. But we're in Pittsburgh and by default, good beers are expected.\n\n- The waiter our group got was seriously one of the worst waiters I have ever gotten. The moment we sat down, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink in a tone of \"I do not want to be here.\" We asked if he could have a moment to look at the menu because it was our first time and asked for one more menu. He walked over to a table with a cute couple and took the menu right off their table and gave it to me without asking the other couple if they were done with it. He then stormed off and didn't come back till way later. When we were ordering food, he gave us attitude for everything and was extremely rude. My friend asked a question and he answered with a sarcastic remark and walked to the next person, never bothering to actually wait or answer the question honestly. When we got our checks, he threw them onto our table. I was extremely annoyed by his attitude towards us, which started before we even spoke to him. I understand that you have bad days and just don't want to deal with anyone, but that is no way to act to someone who is trying their best not to anger you and now completely confused as to why you are treating them like crap. Anywho... rant over. Bleh.\n\n- The pizza was alright. A little dry and not super unique. I felt like it was missing something in flavor. The portions were huge, however.\n\n- I got two beers, the Rotating Stout (which is actually a light beer brewed with coffee and chocolate) and the Dunkel. The Rotating Stout was certainly unique, it didn't have the heavy, silky finish of real stouts, but had it's own unique, refreshing tart with aftertastes of coffee. The Dunkel was smooth and not super strong, again, a good beer to drink. Both beers were great and decently priced, but I would not come back just for the beers when there are other great beer places in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe only reason why I would come back is if I had run out of things to show visiting friends or they saw this on a flyer and HAD to see it. Otherwise, there are so many other unique, amazing things in Pittsburgh that I would love to show friends and family.\n\nSo luckily, I was in good company because the experience here would've been absolutely miserable.
2 ||| I love their korean bbq chicken, but can only give it 3 stars because of the constant gristle I discover.
1 ||| Such a beautiful place! I really love learning about the native plants and getting to see them displayed and highlighted to their best advantage. Anyone who doesn't think the desert can be beautiful needs to come here. In fact, all AZ residents should really come here at least once. As long as the weather is nice, walking the paths at your own pace (hopefully with someone you love) is a great way to spend an afternoon. \n\nI agree with some of the other reviewers that now that the price has gone up to $15, it does make it a little less practical. But it is still a great option for those occasions when you have friends in from out of town or on holiday weeks when you need a fun activity that the whole family will enjoy. I was contemplating getting a membership but they are quite expensive and you still don't even get in for free to the special events like Avant-Garden or the evening concerts so it is just not worth it.
2 ||| Would give it a more stars but the service there isn't very good.  Pie's are all awesome, I got to try almost all of them due to the size of our group once.  Breakfast is awesome if you can get it before they shut it down.  (something silly like 10am)  I've been happy with everything I've eaten here.  Just expect the service to be shotty.
4 ||| Im always bringing everyone here!! I love it so much I highly recommend rainbow roll and crunchy rolls\nHappy hour is a great time to try new things and great deals\nThey have more than just sushi
4 ||| Great repair service!  When we arrived home after a 4 day vacation we found our refrigerator was too warm. We had to call out repair and I found this company. They came out and diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes. We had also had problems with our ice maker for years. The first day he fixed the ice maker and charged us the service fee, and a part had to be ordered,  but he was able to get the fridge back into cooling mode.  Two days later the tech came out and was in our house for less than 15 minutes. He replaced the broken part. Final cost for repair was $158 (they only charge service call for the first visit).\n\nI will use them again and again for appliance repairs. Superior service at fantastic prices.
4 ||| If you have a Japanese car, you should bring it to Japanese Car Service.  More businesses should be named like this one, simple and straight-forward.  And more businesses should provide the excellent service and price that I received here.  \nBasically, my 2005 Acura with over 168,000 miles on it had the steering rack and pinion go kaput.  I usually take my car to the dealer for all of my service needs but when they quoted me $1,400 for the service and labor, I remembered that I'm not a gazillionaire.  I also recalled that I'd given the bestie a ride to JCS when she was getting her car serviced here, so I knew it had to be worth a shot.  Lo and behold, they quoted me HALF what the dealer did, performed the service as promised at the price quoted, and the car was ready in one day instead of the two that they originally said.  I also have a limited warranty of 12 months or 12,000 miles to boot.  \nThanks to Kevin at JCS and the rest of the crew there for turning a potentially wallet-crushing auto repair into something much less stressful and less expensive.  I'm going to be coming here from now on.
2 ||| I played this course today and have played in the past as well. Today the course was in excellent condition, the grass on the tee boxes was a little long and some is the sand traps were not taken care of ( hard and wet ), but the fairways were in great condition as well as the greens. Now I know everyone says 4 to 4 1/2 hours is an acceptable time to play a round of golf but I don't agree with that, anyone can easily shave off an hour at least if they just played the game and acted like they were pros. It took our group 4 1/2 hours to play 18 holes today and on a few tee boxes there were two to three groups backed up all because one group ahead of us had no time management or common courtesy to move along at a quicker pace, they would wait until the group ahead of them cleared the green before teeing off and from the way I saw them hitting the ball, there was no need for them to wait, there was also no marshal on the course to help move along play, I know my group can and has played a round in about three and a half hours and we are not rushing at all. It's just a sad state that someone, somewhere said it should take that long to play a round and so people make it take that long and I have noticed that the more people that watch golf on tv they try to mimic their favorite folders by doing what they do, it's just sad to see that it's taking longer and longer to get in a round of golf and the courses don't and will not do anything to speed up play. I have a few favorites in Vegas I play weekly and I will stick with them because the play is quicker, players know they are not pros and never will be and just want to get out and play, and the courses are in great shape all year round, but I'm going to keep those my secret as to not get the hackers that think they are pros out there and mess up that good thing, and they treat you better than these other \" golf clubs\" ever will. As for stallion mountain, I will not go back anytime soon, until they get people there that will make it a more enjoyable round and for the love of all that's right SPEED UP THE PLAY PEOPLE.
4 ||| Glass Nickel is a great value.  I came back to the hotel after class ended  for lunch.  I had decided to take it easy before exploring near-by.   So looking through the restaurant options that provided delivery to the hotel, the menu of Glass Nickel jumped out at me.  I decided to have Nickel Nuggets (basically bites of bread with marina sauce) and 'home-made' meat lasagna.  The lasagna came with a side salad.  All this for $12.40, cool. \n\nWhen the food arrived, I was very surprised.  It was a lot (could have possible feed at least 3-4) of food.  I was expecting about 10 Nickel Nuggets; there were too many to count.  Honestly, the handful I had didn't seem to make a dent (I guess they could be multiplying in the box, but I don't think so.)  The lasagna was delicious, it lived up to the expectation that 'home-made' had given me.   \n\nThis is a great place to have in a college town.  Cheap, good food that lasts for two or three meals (even if you don't get the Nickel Nuggets).\n\nGuess, I have a decision in front of me.  Do I eat more of it for dinner tonight, or do I go some new to feed the yelping need?  Stay tuned for the answer.
2 ||| Wendy is the best at eyebrows. I lived in vegas most of my life and found her when I was in process of moving to LA. 6 years later or so, I literally schedule\nMy trip when she is available to do my eyebrows. Excellent. I don't go anywhere else.
0 ||| Mimi's has a new French inspired menu. I don't think they did their marketing . The menu is much smaller and is  no longer a family restaurant with a large menu  and the comfort food classics.\n\nThe new menu has a French flavor and portions are smaller and prices higher. I had the tournedos of Bouef and at $ 17.00 was pricey for what I got .\nNo salad or soup  included .\n\nYou can get a better deal at  The Outback Steakhouse or across the Street to Tony Romas which does include soup.\n The steak was mediocre , I was there between 7pm and 8pm on Friday 18 oct and the place was pretty empty which is unusual for Green Valley.\n\nThe pot roast is gone and so is the less expensive more choice Bistro meals .\nYou get more for your buck at  Tony Roma's , Chilis and The Outback Steakhouse .\n\nAnother thing I found annoying is the few  French phrases  being tossed about and  wait staff that could not pronounce what was on the menu .
0 ||| Used to be our staple, but each time I go back their food gets more and more greasy. Who in the world is their new chef???. And their garlic dressing is disgusting.
0 ||| Stopped into Hooters to get some wings tonight in Concord. I had always heard Hooters has great wings. (I have not been to a Hooters in almost 17 years).\n\nWell, I must say I disagree. The wings I just ate where close to the worst I've EVER had. For starters, they were tiny. Second, they were expensive considering what I actually got. And finally, they were not very tasty.\n\nDisappointed is an understatement. $18 down the drain. Pissed!
4 ||| This is a great place to get a reasonably priced lunch. My favorite is the bulgogi beef or marinated chicken combo. You'll get a nice portion of rice some excellent sides and a salad in addition to your main course. People are friendly too!
0 ||| The worst service ever. Got delivery the 1st pizza they messed up so called in and they asked do you want a new one made or a credit we said would like our pizza we ordered so over a hour later our second pizza showed up and the burned it so bad the crust was black. Called and talked to the \"manger Eric\" was very rude and just said well what do you want us to do. Ask for money back said fine and hung up. The worst customer service ever! Stay away from really bad management!
2 ||| I've been here several times when I'm in Las Vegas............ I mostly come here, because my mom & dad like some of the herbs that this store sells.\n\nThis store is your typical basic \"eastern alternative medicine store\"..........herbs they sell here are no different than any other eastern medicine stores. Herbs which Asian people have been using for 100's of years...........\n\nOne of the items that my dad likes to buy is the pre-made \"herbal soup mix\". He likes it because all the ingredients are already mixed into one bag, so he doesn't have to look for all the items separately to make the soup. Real cheap, and very easy to use too............\n\nAnother item he likes to get is the medicinal plaster, & oils to use for his sometimes sore back.\n\nThe staff mostly speak Vietnamese & Chinese.......not the friendliest, but hey............ what do you expect from \"FOB\" people.......Lol!!! We don't come here for customer service, we just come here for the great deals!\n\nI was quite surprised at how many different ethnicity of people who come here...........it's not just for Asians!
2 ||| I haven't been to a Macaroni Grill in years, since most of the locations around me had shut down. I was on business in the area, and decided to give it a go with a couple of associates. \n\nThe restaurant itself looked exactly like I remembered; kind of old world Italian vibe with a little rustic, industrial thrown in for good measure. Not as formal or touristy looking as Olive Garden, but in the same ballpark. \n\nWe were seated immediately, and the waitress was friendly. She seemed very confused about what was on draft when we inquired. I got the lowdown, which wasn't all that impressive. They were certainly very concerned with selling us on their wine special, and prix fixe menu.\n\nThe bread was pretty good, but the waitress put way too much cracked pepper in the olive oil. It was a sea of black pepper and a few sprinkles of olive oil. The pace of the dinner was good, although the second round of drinks was slow. \n\nMy food was OK with pasta that was a little too rubbery in texture. The \"stuffed\" portion of the pasta was a little cold, as if they'd been frozen and reheated. \n\nThere are probably lots of better Italian restaurants in the area that are better.
1 ||| Went here for dinner last night. Won't be back for quite awhile. Our server was a young female who knew nothing about the menu or customer service! I ordered the prime rib , medium and it came well done. Cold potato, the cheese wouldn't even melt. Husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done. Yuck! We ordered Chili instead of salad, when it didn't come out we asked the waitress and she said she brings it out with the meal... Usually it's brought out when the salads are brought out, so she went and got them. Seconds late here came our dinner with more chili...she asked of we wanted it, we told her no, then she went to the table behind us and asked if they wanted it. She told them not to tell anyone she did that and then came back and took the chili from our table and gave it to them.  Needless to say our food was not up to par, not was our service or experience!
0 ||| I must of went on a bad day. (Sunday around 4) Everyone was very disrespectful. Would not acknowledge me at the bar. She was too busy chatting with the strippers. One stripper gave my friend a dance without even asking. She was definitely on something. I could keep going. Not worth coming back. The attitudes here in general ruined our night.
2 ||| So I am know for having a pretty sturdy digestive system and have been know to handle some pretty volitile foods with ease.  I eat at questionable roadside stands and holes-in-the-wall with ease in most cases.    Todays visit to Mi Pueblo challenged that fact.  \n\nGoing in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat I ordered the Nachos.  Seemed ok until I saw that they also had put their red sauce/enchilada sauce all over the chips along with cheese, grilled chicken pico de gallo and refried beans.  WHY did they have to put that red sauce....ugh.  I picked through what I could and couldn't avoid some of it.   I also tried their habanero chipotle salsa and their salsa fresca, both fresh and tasty.  \n\nFast forward about an hour.  Sitting in my meeting... *gurgle...gurgle...gurgle* Ugh... I pushed ignore.  But there came a point that I could ignore no more. Uhh Oh?!  Things were not right.  I may consider myself a queen, but the throne I have been spending the afternoon on is not what I expect. \nHad it not been for my digestive distress and that awful red sauce, I would have considered 3 stars for cleanliness, service, average and generous portion size.
2 ||| Going out on a birthday date, I wanted to give my date a good first time sushi eating experience. Though was left pretty dispointed and a somewhat hefty bill that was beyond what the food was worth.\nBecause this was on a Monday night, it hardly had more than 7 people inside so parking was a breeze. \nInside the layout is pretty akward, and the high tables dont make it easy to be close to your date, the wide tvs were a nice touch and a huge selection at the bar.\nThough the atmosphere was far from welcoming, we ordered the calimari for the appetizer and two rolls (shrimp and the dragon)\nThe calimari was very small in portion but i didnt mind cause it was extremely tough and bland. Our order sat on the counter for 20 minutes before the waitress finally took the time to stop gossiping with another co worker. The rolls were again bland. My date and I eventually decided to just leave and order from the nearby panada express which sadly was FAR better and cheap.
2 ||| I'd like to give Bruegger's Bagels a better rating, but I can't.  There's nothing particularly bad about their bagels, but there's something a little doughy about their taste.  It's best to get them when they're hot.\n\nBut the coffee ain't bad, and since this is right around the corner from work, I'll stop here on occasion.
0 ||| Called for a cab and the driver that called was at the wrong location. Called back, told someone was on the way, 30 minutes and nothing. Complete waste of time and would never call back.
0 ||| Thank God this place went out of business! I went in there one day and chatted up the owner a bit before ordering. It was about 3 in the afternoon and no other customers were around. I asked if I could get a half sandwich and the owner rudely asked what I expected him to do with the other half! Is he THAT stupid or just a smartass!
3 ||| Decent, but uninspired Mexican food.  There's nothing bad about Los Olivos.  The place certainly uses quality ingredients to make its food.  Too bad what end up on the plate was just plain average.\n\nI had the fish tacos and was not impressed.  The fish itself had no taste.  All it really provided was some texture (and hopefully protein).  Without the lime and the sauce and salsa, which are all served on the side, it offered no flavor to the dish.  Couldn't it at least be seasoned a little bit?  My girlfriend had the chicken quesadilla with a side of guacamole.  This was pretty good and huge.  It could easily serve two or three people.\n\nThe chips and salsa are wonderful.  The hot salsa perfectly delivers quite a kick.  The mild was incredibly flavorful.  The cilantro really stood out.  However, I am not a fan of the tubes the salsas are served in.   They're extremely narrow, so you cannot directly dip your chip into them.  You need to pour the salsa on a plate.  That left a narrow liquidy mess on my plate, which doesn't make for good dunking.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite pleasant, and there is a lot of space.  I wouldn't call Los Olivos overpriced.  You'll get a lot of food for your money.  But, I would prefer some more quality over the quantity.
2 ||| Saw Avitar on Christmas day.  Awsome movie, visually stunning.  The theater is very nice.  They announced that they are now a part of Harkins theaters, interesting that they actually announced this, kinda nice to know.  They were sold out and people were trying to buy our tickets while my sister waited in the lobby.  I'm glad we went, comfortable seats, clean theater and awsome 3d experience.  Oh, but the glasses were too big for my face, only complaint.
4 ||| Not my first time of visiting a baja... but definitely the bestest. This review is mostly based on the level of customer service I received. \n\nThe moment I walked in the door I was warmly greeted by Gisela with her gorgeous smile asking if I was ready to order or needed more time. she respected that I needed a few minutes to decide then came over. She also patiently took my annoying order \"little of this, none of that, don't forget...\" she repeated it back perfectly and even asked personally, \"Are you having a rough day?\" ... to which I just said I'm looking forward to my next day off. Still, who asks about your day anymore?! awesome stuff. \n\nNot to stop there... as I found a table to sit and wait for my burrito, she came over and apologized saying \"I might have sprayed a product with bleach here. sorry\" well I don't see any stains on my uniform and it's not like it was her fault anyways. \n\nI even watched her as she told the cook precisely how I wanted everything prepared and it came out perfectly and tasty. \n\nExcellent customer service! she even mentioned \"have a good day & come back here soon\" I'll have to take her up on that since I work nearby. \n\nI know it's just Baja Fresh, but if you haven't visited this location or had the pleasure of meeting Gisela then you're missing out on an awesome guest experience.
1 ||| This used to be my go to place for fish. Yes, they are a little pricey but they used to have super knowledgable staff. Not anymore. The last couple times I've been in I have been extremely disappointed with the staffs lack of ability to answer the \"more advanced\" questions I had. Also, the selection of fish isn't what it used to be. Fintastic used to have unique fish, now they have similar selection to everywhere else. I guess the unique fish went away the same time as the knowledgeable staff.  I also met their manager Larry. What an egotistical prick!  He was rude and demeaning, and appeared to have very little fish knowledge.  I don't know what the owners were thinking when they hired that guy!  I was on the fence about continuing to do business there but once I met the manager and saw his interactions with other customers, I was done.
3 ||| In the working class areas of Phoenix, one can spy a small Mexican eatery every hundred yards. A tortillera here, a taqueria there...blindfold me and send me to Maryvale, my stomach will lead my feet to menudo in mere minutes. \n\nBut here on 67th & Bell, they don't seem too keen on ubiquitous Latin fare. This is middle class, soccer mom territory, and for the most part the locals seem satisfied sustaining themselves on Chipotle. But what if they dare venture to another part of town? Certainly, their curiosity must make them hungry for something slightly more authentic.\n\nWell with Caramba's in town, they must not feel like they have to. This place is a parody of every obscure \"bertos\" I've stumbled into on an empty stomach. The music is all in Spanish, and there's some good ol' futbol on TV. The cashier was eager to explain away any menu item, as if the usual clientele couldn't tell their chilaquiles from an enchilada. Jajaja.  \n\nAnyways, I ordered the fundido, because I figured their specialty was more...Tex Mex. It wasn't too appealing, essentially a fried burrito topped with generous amounts of an interesting cream cheese sauce. I washed it down with a fountain drink, but then I spied a sign...they charge a quarter for refills. That's not much at all, but not even Taco Bell does that--why should they? \n\nOut of defiance, I tossed my cup and just ordered a margarita. $3.25 seemed like a steal, I was excited to have one with my breakfast. I didn't mind it coming out of a fountain, but it was incredibly strong! Stronger than any margarita I've had in a restaurant. But, it was still worth it.\n\nApparently, their specialty is the cheese crisp, the more complex of them branded \"Mexican pizza\". I saw some being ordered, and I wasn't the slightest bit impressed, especially with tortillas that tasted like they came from the Fry's next door.\n\nPersonally, I don't think Carambas deserves the popularity it has. The food is middle-of-the-road, and their prices the same amount as a dozen places you could eat breakfast across the value. Nothing special about their salsas or tortillas, which is alarming enough. However, it was very clean, the staff was swift and polite, and they have adult beverages. It's okay for a nice, quiet breakfast.
3 ||| Have had amazing meals here. Lobster Bisque is as good as it gets.
3 ||| I believe that every pho lover in Vegas will eventually make it to Pho Kim Long because the ample amount of reviews. The menu is pretty vast and the atmosphere is comfortable and nice. Although the food satisfied my pho craving, it did not impress me. My rating will go to Pho Saigon 8.
0 ||| One of the smallest airport in the U.S.  Flew here for a short layover to Greenville (GSP).  Can't really stand small airport since all the planes are so small and me being 6'4\" is very difficult to sit comfortably in my seat.  Next time I'll fly into big airports.
1 ||| The food is great but the issue we have is with call ahead. They tell you 15-25 minutes and it always ends up being 45! You ask if the order is all there and it never is. I told my husband this is the last time I go there. It's sad because we really like the food.
0 ||| The only thing worse than the food is the service.
4 ||| It's not everyday that one has the opportunity to eat Afghani food and have work pay for it. How could I not try this place out? \n\nSo, I would trust your server if you have no clue as to what to order. If you've had Mediterranean or other middle eastern food, you'll probably be familiar with some of the options. \n\nI really stuffed myself and hobbled out of here with a full stomach and a smile on my face. I would definitely return and will try to bring my friends or coworkers next time.
4 ||| I never made it to The Vegetarian House and decided to try this location again once Loving Hut took over the space. \n\nWe went on a Friday night, the space was clean and white if not a bit to stark (adjusting the lighting would work). The food was similar to the other dishes I have had at other Loving Hut locations so at least it was consistent.\n\nThe only problem I saw was the service. Everyone seemed to be trying hard and remained friendly while at the same time appearing very scatter brained. We noticed people flagging down waitresses as soon as we sat down so we knew something was aloof. It just seemed to be that they didn't have everything together, like it was opening week or something. Things took awhile and you could see the frantic pace to which everyone was trying to get things done, yet the restaurant was a 1/4 full.\n\nMaybe they will iron out some of they service issues, the food is still good although the menu is a bit tired - or I may just be tired of it. I should be thrilled with another vegan restaurant in the valley, but the more I sample vegan cuisine outside of Phoenix the more I crave more of that here.
3 ||| In the words of Drake, the Farm Fries here \"be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there.\" In theory, anyway. Fries plus chicken gravy (with pieces of fried chicken) and shredded cheese, in a giant portion, for $4.  Except the gravy could be better, and the cheese is cheap and rendered almost tasteless. But if you can overlook the fact that the product could be better, it's excellent for drowning your sorrows in on a bad day.\n\nThat being said, the chicken is largely regarded as mediocre and I ordered the clucketos and was underwhelmed as well- crispy, topped with lettuce and cheese, served with a side of salsa, but stuffed with chicken ground so finely as to make me suspicious of it's quality. \n\nAnd \"The Gobbler\" is basically a dry-as-ashes fried piece of poultry (you can't even taste that it's turkey), about on par in size and appearance with the \"Chicken Littles\" or \"Snackers\" at KFC, served with packets of cranberry and Miracle Whip. Not only is the sandwich sad, small, and disgusting, but it's not worth more than a buck or two.And whoever created Miracle Whip should be burned at the stake.\n\nAs others have said, order was ready in a flat two minutes- which is remarkable. Frankly I'm surprised the clucketos were so crisp because I can't figure out how they cooked them so fast. But those fries, man... it's actually kind of a blessing they're not better. I mean unless your life goal is to weigh four hundred pounds.
3 ||| 4.5 Stars. It's been years since my first visit to Penn Brewery, so I wanted to refresh my memory while I was back in the area. First, it's not in the most convenient location up on Troy Hill, but still pretty easy to get to from either Route 28 or I-279. Parking is a little on the rough side, in a gravel lot across the street. That's apparently an issue for some, but I could care less...it's free! Can't say that about very many places in the city.\n\nAfter walking through the courtyard and walking up the stairs, I noticed the lunchtime crowd wasn't too busy. I read through the Penn Brew drafts listed on the chalkboard behind the bar and decided to try the Penn Dark (of course). The I looked at the menu and saw this:\n\n\"Bacon Brew Dog: A natural-casing hot dog stuffed with fresh jalapenos, wrapped in bacon, then deep-fried and topped with BBQ sauce, shredded cheddar Jack cheese, and vinegar slaw in a hot dog bun.\"  SAY WHAT!?  I told the bartender that's what I wanted and he grinned and said \"Oh, those are really good. I haven't had one in awhile. Nice choice.\"\n\nLong story short, it was awesome! I probably could've eaten two of them, albeit I would've paid the price for it dearly later on. The friendly bartender also let me sample some of the other brews, including Penndemonium (Brewer's Choice Series) and Summer Berry Weiss (seasonal), both smooth, refreshing and sweet.\n\nI'm very happy I revisited Pittsburgh largest and oldest brewery, but slightly bummed I missed out on their $3 Happy Hour drafts. Good thing to remember for next time.
4 ||| Let me say how excited I was when I heard this location was going to open. My husband and I love their sandwiches and decided to stop in for dinner about quarter to 7. Therefore it was quite busy, we place our order and took our seats amongst the crowd of people. It took a little longer than expected, so once we noticed people that ordered after us got there food we spoke up. Once they realized they accidentally skipped us they immediately apologized and worked hard to make our food as soon as possible. You could tell they were training people because it is such a new location, Because of the inconvenience they offered us more than enough compensation. It was a simple mistake but we are very pleased with how the workers handled the issue.
2 ||| I frequent the bell and dysart locations and  this was the first time it was \"eh\". The Bigfoot chicken fried steak and eggs are always large and more than enough. The gravy this time seemed watery and the toast was half burnt and half bread. The other meal of a bacon and cheese stuffed burger looked awesome but we had to return because it was requested with no onion. The replacement was nothing more than a regular burger with bacon and cheese. The bear claws which are usually nice and hot was cold and was missing its butter, and some bites felt like I was chewing dough. It was busy on a Friday night and the place seemed understaffed. After wards when most of the dinner rush was over our waitress barely made any rounds to check up on us and did not get one single refill for our soda and tea. They were nice to remove my date's burger from the bill. Because of our frequent dine ins and our bear rewards card the bill came to 40 cents. If you go to this place and want good service you will have to wait that weekend morning for about 45 minutes when the star employees are working.
2 ||| Pretty average Mexican food.  Went for lunch and had the stacked enchilada plate with chicken.  The chips served before the meal were hot and crispy but the salsa was only fair.  Like mine chunky and this was a bit too watery for me.  The stacked enchiladas were nothing special.  Store bought corn tortillas swimming in green sauce and cheese.  The chicken inside had little flavor and could have been shredded better.  It came as a couple of large chunks of meat.  The beans and rice...well...average once again.\n\nService was okay as was the cost.  Guess I prefer the little places closer to downtown Phoenix in the 16th-24th street area as they are much more authentic tasting.  This would probably be a good option for families with small kids or older folks looking for more bland Mexican options.\n\nAll in all rates a meh.  This is my first usage of the meh word as I didn't feel I understood it until now.
0 ||| Don't go in here if your black. They will be extra rude to you. The wait was longer than I expected so I changed my mind. Wife wanted to stay so I went back and reserved a table for 5 again. She claims I said 5. She did that to be nasty. And I think because we were the only black family there.
2 ||| I've been to several events/conferences at the Phoenix Convention Center.  The facility is nice and modern with spacious pre-function areas and a nice selection of food options.  There's a Crust Pizza that serves up Pastas and Pizza for quick eats.  That's my favorite outlet to grab lunch or a snack if I don't like what the conference meal program offers.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/phoenix-convention-center-phoenix?select=8z7f14l2NjninBjZ-R7Tpw#8z7f14l2NjninBjZ-R7Tpw\n\nThe worst part about attending an event here is the parking.  Your choices are underground self parking garages that range from $6-$12 per day.or if the conference/event pays for a valet service, you might have that option for a fee.  There's also parking at area hotels that costs $ too and can be quite a walk. \n\nOnce you get inside it's easy to get turned around trying to figure out what side of the building you're on.  The directional signage is not very good.  It takes me a couple of days to get oriented when attending a large conference here.\n\nOverall, the experience is pretty average for a convention center.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%
1 ||| Maybe it was just me but this place was a bit of a let down.\n\nThe bakery was passable and I found the food selection to be inferior to Mekong, Lee Lee's, and Asiana Market in Mesa and Tempe.\n\nThe Chinese Culture part is a bit of joke really, if culture can be absorbed by walking through oriental themed buildings and the grocery. \n\nOne could glean more Chinese Culture in Chandler imo
0 ||| Rob Reviews\nThank you For reading!!\n\n\nI have been using this establishment for about two years because its close and convenient with two babies.  I have been trying desperately to have my wife get a new pediatrician but for time and convenient sake she keeps using this place. \n\nLet me be specific as to why i don't like this place.\n\nSome of the doctors are OK im  referring to the business as a whole.\n\nFirst off on multiple occasions when i call in to set an appointment they always have a nurse call back before hand to ensure that an appointment is  needed, OK not a problem. But ALL  of time they call back 3-5 hours later and on multiple Occasion they never called me back at all -BIG PROBLEM. \n\nPeople get busy and need to know if they can take a kid in we cant wait a whole work day waiting on a call not going to work staying home with kid to see if they call and when\n\nThey are never apologetic for this by the way. \n\nAlso wait times are ridiculous when you finally do get to the back they never apologize for the wait nor do they communicate efficiently about anything. On multiple occasions i can hear the doctor and nurses talking outside my room cause they are right next to the door about non work ive literately and my wife have come out of the room and reminded them that we are waiting and the nurse will come in and say were just really busy. Not really i heard you talking about your relationship. \n\nMy son had croup and couldn't breath a year ago and he looked horrible so i took him in they prescribed a breathing machine but my little baby was all red and couldn't breath .\n\nI at that point asked them \"should i take him to the hospital\" and they said well its up to you I asked  well \"if this was your son looking like this would you take him in to the hospital\" she said still well its really up to you you could wait another day or two.\n\nAs i left i said hell no im taking him to Phoenix children s and he had a three day stay just to get him back to normal they gave him top notch care and steroids to calm the inflammation he could have died. ( he was under a year old). He couldn't breath. They should have recommended i take him for the well being of the child. \n\nOn many occasions i have been dissatisfied with them- PEOPLE WE HAVE TO BE SMARTER AND MORE PROACTIVE IN THE WAY OUR CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR AND NOT JUST TAKE THE WORD OF A DOC JUST BECAUSE. \n\nThere care is sub-par. \n\nNot to mention about a year or two ago and this was on the news GOOGLE IT that a doctor mind you not an employee was caught with child porn and relieved of employment. and I believe he was convicted google it.\n\nOverall I am dissatisfied with this place . If you are in the west valley do your self a favor and look elsewhere.\n\nSome people may be satisfied with sub par care but im not if your going to take my co-pay and bill my insurance give me the best care and run your operation like a business that cares and remember I've been here for two years enough is enough i will not allow my wife to take them here anymore I literally have been to urgent cares that were cleaner and more efficient and friendly than this pediatrics.\n\nRob Reviews
2 ||| OK, I must start by saying that this horrible experience was made right byt he owner who was aghast and refunded my entire $50 ticket! I took my wife and daughter out for a special Christmas tea - or I thought so. It was not very Christmas like, although they were not advertising as such, and the music was Christmas, but rocky. The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL! Little dainties of mini eclairs and mini cheesecake squares still frozen with some Rheddi Whip Cream on the side. My six year old loved as she has a dairy intolerance and took an enzyme and she got to splurge. All of this with the griping trainer and the poor helpless trainee for 19 bucks a person. What else could you ask for? A REFUND - which the owner graciously gave us. The place has potential - but needs to work out the kinks, up the presentation, get a better scone recipe, take some time to learn about teas and train their staff, and YES - learn to bake desserts! A 3 tiered plate for presentation and some real tea cups would be nice too! Sorry TEETER house - my Christmas special was a bomb - the best part of it was I did not have to pay for it.
2 ||| First half of the $10 corned beef sandwich was good and the Rye Bread was solid as well throughout. The second half though contained a decent amount of fatty pieces which lowered the star value of the place. The other star goes because the fries were limp and undercooked for the most part. Did no tealize it was Chicago style and still don't know what that means really. I'm a NY style person, so I will return to my New York places now. Chicago makes hot dogs - New York is deli king.
0 ||| Signed up just to write this review. The only saving grace is Monty's employees who are very courteous and friendly. I'm a pianist, so I've been buying books from here for years, but I've never actually interacted with Monty, just his employees. \n\nI'm about to take up ukelele, but I've already bought the ukulele. I did my research and found an affordable entry-level ukulele and found what strings are recommended for it, so I came in for the strings and to just browse the other ukuleles. Monty came in, and he was friendly when showing me the ukuleles, but then I told him that I already bought one online and I was just looking into some strings and he immediately became caustic upon realizing that he wasn't going to make a sale. He didn't have my brand of strings - he only carries Martin - and I got a lecture about how I shouldn't be so closed-minded about what kind of strings I'm buying. I left, and he sarcastically thanked me for allowing him to help me.\n\nI guess I could throw in that I know someone who came here for guitar lessons and complained about Monty's bitterness as well and how she didn't learn anything. I'm never coming here again.
0 ||| I don't usually like to write negatively about any business, especially local businesses...but I just had to in this case. We've lived in Queen Creek for about a year and a half and been to this cafe several times, as well as to the adjoining bar. This place need an overhaul from top to bottom. It always seems dirty and has an extremely outdated western feel to it. The staff, although friendly enough, was very unprofessional (not bringing us a high-chair [which I ended up having to get myself], laughing and joking loudly in the dining area, yelling back and fourth with the kitchen staff from the dining area...).\n\nThe food can be summarized in one word: disappointment. I've had several different sandwiches and they were bland and VERY greasy. Appetizers were the same, under-seasoned and dripping with grease. I love a good fish fry and I must admit I've had theirs more than once. It's decent most times but very hit-and-miss. Tarter sauce is not very good however. \n\nTo be fair, they do make a good burger most times. Good size patties and a good seasoning used in them. The only negative issue with the burgers are their \"Bacon Burgers\" which they make that have the bacon mixed into the burger itself. The concept is WONDERFUL,,,sounds terrific in theory. The issue however is that the bacon meat and the beef don't have the same cooking times and the bacon on the inside of the patty remains pretty much raw. I ordered it one time and one time only. It's the ONLY Bacon Cheeseburger I have ever not finished. Again...disappointing. \n\nThe bar is ok...it's a typical dive bar. Not bad for a drink or two from time to time or if you want to watch a game.\n\nI wanted to love this neighborhood hole-in-the- wall soooo badly when I moved to Queen Creek...I just can't.
3 ||| Food was pretty good.  I had the Greek salad and my sister had pizza both good choices here.  Staff is friendly.
0 ||| This is my first time trying Olive Garden and I was very disappointed by the service. The server that catered to us was just horrible (Not to mention any names). He came to our table at least 3x the whole dinner and took about 7 minutes to retake our order because we wanted something else. I am very generously giving them 3 stars as the food was really good. I ordered the Tour of Italy and the portion was plentiful. I couldn't even finish my  order and had to bring it home. But at least he sort of made up for by giving us a whole bag of that awesome breadsticks! I will for sure be going to Olive Garden again, but just not this one.
4 ||| I've been dying for an authentic cortadito since getting hooked on them in Miami. It was the first thing I asked for when I stepped through the doors! Hello?! Who knew Vegas had a great Cuban spot! When the manager showed me to what felt like a private buffet room, I was sold. My mouth watered as I passed the Tres Leche cake, glistening Maduros, and Pollo a la Plancha! For $10, all you can eat? If I could will myself to stay at the Howard Johnson, I might eat here everyday!
4 ||| Great place. Loved it. Good starters loved every bite. Pasta fantastic. And lastly loved the Tiramisu. Will be back
4 ||| My wife and I have been shopping from the time they opened several years ago. I don't remember when that was but quite a few years ago. \nWe have been fortunate to be able to travel and it is nice to have a place you can go and get some of the things you got while traveling. They have a good chocolate section where you can get chocolate from different countries. This can be seasonal and not always available. I don't drink much wine or beer but the selection seems to be good. \nThe people that work there are quite knowledgable about what they have and if they are out or don't carry have been helpful in helping us find the product we were looking for. \nMy experience has a been when I was looking for something and ask they just drop what they are doing and away they go with you helping you find what you need. \nIf you have not been? There are several in the Phoenix area. I always come here because I get good service,
0 ||| My family and I used moved here and this is our local pizza hut. The first time we ordered and had it delivered, everything was awesome. The second time, our wing order was short a wing. The MOD told me that he didn't have \"math majors\" working there so we're sorry. OMG, really? You need \"Math Majors\" to count to 16? This third time our pizza was 45 min late (quoted 30 min, but it took 75), both pizzas were luke warm as a result, no seasoning in the sauce or the dough, and we didn't get our stuffed crust. Paul, the MOD, apologized as said to ask for him to ensure it is made right next time since he has a lot of new people there and training has been challenging. Umm, NO. We wont be returning. I will drive a little further to another location.
2 ||| Man, Oh Man I forgot how huge the Charlotte Convention Center is!\n\nThis past weekend I had the pleasure of spending nearly every waking moment of my day inside the Convention Center. Upon my arrival the convention center was playing host to 3 major event; the National Convention for NACA  and 300+ universities nationwide, an International Motorcycle show  in addition to the CIAA basketball tourney meetings/conferences. The convention center is so large that the only time I interacted with persons from these other events was in passing or riding one of the numerous escalators. \n\nInside the conference rooms, meeting halls and exhibit spaces the Convention center staff did a phenomenal job creating an environment that logically flowed from one space to the next, and stationed themselves along the hallways and across all levels of the convention center to ensure that no was were to get lost. And if lost, all one had to do was simply ask a staff for a little guidance and would be immediately assisted  with superior customer service.\n\nI digress, let's get back to the sheer size of this place. According to the Convention Center website there is  280,000 sq. ft. of exhibit space, 850,000 sq. ft. of state-of-the-art features and award winning amenities, More than 90,000 sq. ft.of flexible meeting space, 35,000 sq. ft. Convention Center Ballroom, 40,000 sq. ft. Crown Ballroom and a Full service in-house catering. I'm sorry but that is ALOT going on under one roof. Imagine what you could do with all of that space, amenities, and friendly staff! The possibilities are truly endless. With all that being said if you need a GIGANTIC space for any known reason under the sun, pick the Charlotte Convention Center! You'll thank yourself later  ;) \n\n\nP.S. If you get hungry for a little snack the convention center is also home to an inhouse Bojangles', Buon Cibo, and Einstein Bros. Bagels.
0 ||| Meh. The food was ok, and the service was less than satisfactory. I love Village Inn deals, but their service is NEVER great. We have 3 locations nearby (Apache Junction, Signal Butte and Power & Main) and have gone to each at least a dozen times in the last 13 years. We have never been impressed by the quality of service from the wait staff. The VIB breakfast is a good deal though, so we've gone back. However, this last trip might have changed that for me. I ordered biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were not made how they used to be. Pretty crumby, really. My wifes cr\u00e9pe was all soggy amd weird, too. To top it off, it was like pulling teeth, trying to get an iced tea refill. Not impressed by the AJ location at all this trip. Still love the hashbrowns though!
2 ||| Good drinks.  Service is kinda iffy.  but whatever.\n\nA bit on the pricey side, but it's Vegas.\n\nDrinks are a tad sweet.
0 ||| Did I get sick here? No.\nWas the food knarly? No.\nDid the waitress dis Coke products ? (How uncouth!) Yes\nWas I charged for food we didn't order? Yes.\n\nWill I ever come back to Firebirds? No.
0 ||| On Sunday my family was here visiting from California and after a day of shopping, this Wal-mart was the most convenient location for me to shop for some quick groceries. \n\nUpon walking into this Wal-mart, the unprofessionalism of the staff at this location was shocking to me, and this Wal-mart was very unmaintained.\n\nThe door greeter was hitting on some girl and they had an \"Asset Protection\" employee going along with it. Ignoring that, we continued our shopping, upon checkout the cashier demanded everyone's IDs for the beer we were purchasing. I explained to the cashier that the purchase was being made by my father and I was not going to be involved in the consumption of the liquor but she still demanded to see everyone's IDs. I understand that stores can set their own liquor policies but the rudeness of this staff member was ridiculous. I also explained to her that their policy was faulty, and asked her why she is carding all the adults but not the children. I walked away to avoid further confrontation while my father purchased everything else.\n\nUpon exiting this Wal-mart, their \"Asset Protection\" asked to see my receipt. Obviously this Wal-mart is run by idiots who do not understand that they cannot ask to see someone receipt without either a written statement placed in plain view explaining that they reserve the right to see receipts (Fry's Electronics), or written in the contract upon joining a club store (Costco, Sam's). \n\nThis Wal-Mart is a joke and should be avoided.
1 ||| quick quiz.... what's worse than going to planned parenthood?  \n\n...tick, tock...\n\nready for the answer?!  \n\nhere it is: going to planned parenthood and having about the most judgmental nurse and doctor EVER!!  \n\ni support what planned parenthood is all about, but it would totally awesome if their staff was on board too.  i have gone there several times in the last few years for exams or if i needed birth control and didn't have insurance at the time.  most of the time, the staff is great.  they are cheerful and seemingly happy to be doing their job.  however, on two occasions, i had the most judgmental doctor and nurse duo ever.  i wish i remembered their names, but i don't.  i felt like i was in an interrogation room right from the start.  they scrutinized my answers to most of their really personal questions; almost as if they thought i were lying.  as if that wasn't enough, when i asked for birth control, i was subject to the rapid fire questioning again.   really, if i'm there, and i'm asking for birth control, does it matter how many sexual partners i \"plan\" to have?  at the time, i really felt intruded upon.  it was none of her business if i was conducting elaborate orgy parties or i had been married for 10 years.  i didn't want to get pregnant, and that should have been enough.  \n\nso why three stars?  because i think this is a valuable service.  most of the time their providers are great.  at the end of the crappy visits, i still got birth control prescribed to me.  do doctors have bad days?  i am sure they do.  do they sometimes have to take jobs they don't want to just to pay the bills?  i'm also sure they do that as well.  it certainly felt like that was the sort of doctor i was sitting with on those two occasions.  one that didn't want this job and was perhaps having a bad day.  bottom line is... it's not super professional.  it happens, though.
2 ||| I've eaten outside at East Boulevard Bar and Grill a couple of times.   In fact, I was relieved that we did eat outside, because as we walked through the inside of the old house, the smell of dirty mop water and mildew permeated my olfactory senses.  \n\nThe seating outside is nothing to write home about and it fills up quickly on the weekends, but it's always nice to have outdoor seating at a restaurant if temperature and bug conditions permit.   \n\nEast Boulevard Bar and Grill has the potential to be a cool, casual place to hang out with a group of friends if you're in the area, but it's not someplace to go out of your way for.  The food is just okay and the service is spotty.  On a hot summer evening, we waited too long for a cold beer refill.
2 ||| The airport is clean, nice, plenty of food places and drink places.  Even some nice art shops.  BUT, I hate my departure early Monday AM, usually in A29.  There is a roundabout of gates about  30 ft apart from each other, at the very end of the \"hall of gates\".  Someone in their infinite scheduling wisdom, makes all the flights take off within the same 5 minute window.  You cannot get a seat prior to your flight by the gate; there simply are not enough seats for even one flight.  There are people standing EVERYWHERE, waiting to get on their flight, and they all are in one another's way.  It infuriates me every Monday AM when I fly in there.   I would think they would attempt to stagger the flights, so that you didn't have this massive traffic jam of humans every week. \nAnother tip:  wear good walking shoes if you are changing planes here.  It's a darn big airport, and there is potentially a lot of walking to be done.
2 ||| I've gone here off and on for nearly 20 years...I'd go more often but honestly, it's way overpriced.\n\nFood is fresh and delicious which brings me back...but shortly after I walk in I remember why it is often 6-12 months between visits.\n\nFirst, it's cash only...they have an ATM inside which charges you 3 or so dollars to make a withdraw - that's a pet peave of mine - a business should make it easy for their customers to buy from them.\n\nSo sour taste write off the bat...then the prices. If you like cheese and guacamole on your taco...it'll cost you nearly nearly $4 for one taco - that's ONE TACO, no beans/rice (that's extra) and NO CHIPS - they don't have them.\n\nSo I was in the area a couple weeks ago and took my family there for lunch on a Saturday to introduce it to them - it costs $60 for lunch for 6 people...which is absolutely rediculous (and yes, I had to pay a fee to get money out of their ATM because I forgot to take out cash prior.\n\nSave some money and go to Elmers Taco Shop down the street...you can feed the fam and have enough left over to see a movie.
4 ||| Having grown up in Europe, if there is one thing I truly miss is high quality sandwiches. Nothing wrong with Subways, but the quality of the bread, despite being made several times a day seems to be very cardboardish. Sack's was close to were I worked and has so far been my favorite sandwich place in Phoenix. Always a but crowded and busy, maybe noisy for some but I'd rather be in a place that feels busy and alive than the only one eating my sandwich. My  favorties are the Improv and the Gothic (warm sandwich). All sandwiches comes with a little cookies which is always pleasant I find. Only negative and I'll admit to ignoring the suggestion is that there is a sign by the owners that ask those who have \"regular\" sized cups to not refill. Not very customer friendly I think. But, and I ask the manager/owner from time to time I really do wish they would open one up in Scottsdale. Prices are probably a bit high, it comes with the neighborhood but I do think the quality of the sandwiches make up for it.
2 ||| I should be more selfish and write a better review because it might help membership #'s, but the truth is, it's not what it should be.  It's ok for what I pay, but I only do bball and sometimes swimming.  There are consistent issues, such as a dirty locker room, no soap, missing nets on the hoops, SAND in the hot tub!!, steam room that doesn't work,   towels out, etc.  The staff really needs to get it together.  The issues are a result of poor leadership.\n\nI would say the staff is very friendly to me and regulars, though.
2 ||| if you're near goodwin, need to refuel, don't feel like messing with green street, etc, then this is a good bet for lunch.  i usually get the tuna salad sandwich.  i give that 3 stars.  but what should probably be noted is the 5 star rating on the carnegie cheesecake.  the crust is really more of a sable cookie and the creaminess of the cake is unparalleled.  it's total museum food with a nice vibe from the crowd.  if you sit along the north bank of windows which appear to be 50 feet high, you can almost forget you are surrounded by cornfields.  good place for meetings too cuz there are tons of tables.  dinner before a performance is plausible as well if you are under time constraints.
2 ||| Easy 5. Authentic old school ice cream parlor with PSU ice cream ( peachy paterno etc). The ice cream soda was an outstanding ride in the wayback machine.
2 ||| Came here for cocktails when there was live country music on Sunday night. The resort is really breathtaking with swimming pools that seemed to go on for miles.\n\nIn 4 days visiting Scottsdale everywhere I went had terrible drinks either too strong or just plain bad. It became the joke of the weekend, that there must be at least one good bartender in Arizona... The one and only good cocktail I had was a mojito here at Hyatt. Excuse me GREAT cocktail. THANK YOU!
0 ||| The food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.\nFood is bad a year than a year\uff0cI never come back\uff01
2 ||| Let's be honest. You don't go here for the food. You don't go here to be waited on. You go here to play a game, or to drop your kids off so they can play. Sure, if you are having a birthday party there you expect to be waited on a *bit* more, but to expect falling-all-over-you service is just unrealistic in these establishments. It was fun, the kids had a good time, and the birthday party went smoothly. That's all you need.
0 ||| This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.
3 ||| Decent sports bar with an open floor plan.  It's cool to walk in and quickly pan the place to see what the vibe is.  I've only been here late night on Saturdays and it's usually a pretty mellow crowd just \"watchin' the game, havin' a Bud...\"
2 ||| I have been in this store more times in the last 2 months than I like to admit . First I switched all my lines over from Verizon to Sprint for the 100.00 a month for up to 10 lines. I wont waste your time reading a big story , basically when you go in here the wait time is insane. Then when you purchase an item its like buying a used car they assume you are going to buy accessories and push the insurance on you . I went in yesterday to add another IPAD to my account. Usually I deal with one of the guys , but  I went in and of course had about a 45 minutes wait. Finally the girl calls my name and asked pretty much What did I want. I told her I wanted to add an IPAD she pulls up my account and then goes in the back to get the IPAD. 10 minutes goes by and I am still waiting for her to come back, I see the floor supervisor Zack and asked where she went . He said they are out of stock and she is calling around looking for another store who would send it to there store. First off why not just come out and tell me we are out of stock would you like me to check another store . Instead I sat there wondering where she went. Finally she comes out to tell me they did not have the IPAD. I told her forget it I will just call customer service to order one. Long behold I find out since the new Ipad came out there is a 1-4 week wait on it. However... I was able to find one at another store. I called and they had one, she held it for I drove  over and I was in and out in 20 minutes,
1 ||| i have lived her for a week and have not had a good experence. we have had cockaroaches, the ice maker breaking, we are unable yo use our alram system, and the managment is not up to par. the appointments we set up through managment have all been late, i get nothing but attitude from maria (front desk).i really regret moving into this place.
4 ||| I first ventured to La Tavola after it was recommended by a co-worker when I had a summer internship in Pittsburgh. I was a bit skeptical at first because one of the first things I noticed was that each table had a fairly prominent table number placed in it (much like they have at weddings and such). This wasn't something I expected from a first class establishment, nor was I expecting the bread to be served in plastic baskets. However these were both moot points as the service and food were both as good as it gets. I have been back many times over the years and though I no longer live or work in the city, I make a point to eat at La Tavola each time I visit Pittsburgh. I have brought many friends and relatives to La Tavola and they all have nothing but great things to say. \n\nMy cliff notes:\n-Calamari diavlo (sp?), amazing appetizer that isn't on the menu but is offered every night as far as I know. I order it every time and am never disappointed. \n-Byob. Not sure what the corkage is but it rounds to zero. Enough said. \n-The staff knows the menu inside out as well as any specials being offered. Most if the servers I have had are clearly there fir the long term and have a vested interest in providing the best service possible\n-Carmella owns the restaurant along with her husband. They also are the chefs. Very sweet people who care about their patrons, food, and having a good time\n-very accommodating to large groups. I've gone with just my girlfriend or with a group of 14. Food is always fantastic and I never har problems making reservations the day of, granted the day I went with 13 other friends was a weds\n-sometimes when they are very busy the service can be a bit slow if you are with a large party. Make sure you brig good company and good wine.\n-prices are very reasonable for food of the best quality\n-the lack of reviews in no way is representative of the amount if business they get. There are usually a few large parties every time I go and everyone always seems to have a great time\n-menu is not the easiest thing to read as most items are in Italian. Fortunately, the staff is always more than happy to explain anything and everything to you in as much detail as possible\n-pizza is amazing. Best I've had in Pittsburgh hands down. They have a little \"shop\" attached to the restaurant for take out or delivery. Highly recommended
0 ||| We have gone twice.  The first time we actually got a table after waiting almost an hour.  The food was OK as long as you stick to burgers and pizza.  The beer was pretty good though.  The cons were the service.  Once we actually got sat, the wait staff was very inattentive.  The second time we went we were told that they don't accept reservations on weekend nights.  We couldn't even sit at the bar it was that crowded.  And they told us an hour and a half wait.  For decent beer and OK food, totally not worth it.
3 ||| Visiting vegas saw this suggested on yelp. Big portions, great flavors, friendly staff, and at good prices.
3 ||| Great little dive bar. cheap well drinks and beer, and def a late night spot.
1 ||| I understand contracts. I understand cancellation  policies. Long story short they didn't receive my mailed cancelation notice ( they wouldn't let me cancel in office for some reason that day). That's my fault I should not rely on someone else to do their job. So I canceled at the moon valley location in person. Plus I cancelled my credit card but they have some agreement with capital one that allowed them to access my new account ??!!  so I continued to pay for kids club/daycare  while I was not a member. The club is overpriced unless you need a pool or want  to pay too much for one on one training. Try fitness1 at 7th street and union hills. I pay yearly and including daycare/group fitness it is around $15 a month.  The more you pay for the gym isn't going to get you more in shape.
0 ||| Worst outback I've been to. The service sucks and there food is not good. Very ran down so don't waist your time and money at this location. I do love outback tho, just not this location.
4 ||| First time here and we love it! Not too crowded, and it's about 11 minutes from where I live! It's great!
4 ||| I've lived in Phoenix since 1998 and have heard wonderful things about Carolina's since then, and until today, I had never been.\n\nMy fiance and I stopped in today for a late lunch (around 2:30pm) and are so happy we did.  The place wasn't packed but it was busier than we expected.  We checked out the menu, made our selections, and ordered; he got the beef enchiladas and I got the flautas with beans & rice, plus a tortilla since they have such a reputation.\n\nWe only had to wait a few minutes before our food was ready.  IT didn't disappoint!  The flautas were crispy, the shredded beef was flavorful, and the sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese were just right.  The rice was really good, but I think I'll skip the beans next time.  My fiance's beef enchiladas were good and he finished them all.\n\nThe best part, though, was the tortilla.  Amazing.  Before we left, I picked up a dozen to enjoy later. Oh yeah, baby.
3 ||| Golden Steer is trading on its Vegas history. We started w crab cakes, lobster bisque, and salads. Salads were very good, but apps were avg. For entrees we had ribeye and fillet. Both ok...not bad but nothing special. Wine list was just ok. Nothing was bad but the prices were similar to higher end steak restaurants and food just wasn't that good. I'd prefer to go to Del Friscos or several other places. The live piano/singer in the bar was nice.
4 ||| This place is absolutely the best sushi in the valley. No question about it! I eat here at least twice a month and love it. Probably 100 rolls on the menu and Sake (world's greatest sushi chef ever) probably has another 100 in his head!!! You must go and see for yourself. Ask for Sake and just tell him what you like and he will give you a list of rolls to try. Definitely try the Grand Canyon Roll, Phoenix Suns Roll, and the Tuna Poke for sure!!! If you want something different try the Romantic Roll, Cowboy Roll, or the Smokey and the Bandit Roll!!! Enjoy
2 ||| I have been an infrequent but long-term customer of Cactus Flower since the early 1990's. Last year I had unsatisfactory experiences with one of the shops, but decided to give the Phoenix shop a try. Good decision, for the one order they delivered.  \n\n I stopped in yesterday to order for V Day. A somewhat distracted employee tossed a couple tattered catalog pages on the table for me to choose from, and described a few. When I asked that it be delivered by the time the recipient leaves work, she said school delivery was before 2, and businesses by 5 PM. Since the recipient leaves work by 3, I asked that she be included in the \"school\" delivery. No can do, policy is policy! It came down to a quick but clearly evident battle of wills between the young employee and me, she wasn't going to budge, and I wasn't going to risk the order being late.  \n\nSo I voted with my dollars, 150 of them, and took my business elsewhere.
1 ||| I used to really enjoy going to Manifest for their used records. But it seems like they are not getting anything good in the last few months, they will have 10 of the same record which is really annoying when you are digging in crates. Their new record section sucks and is WAY over priced. I really do not see me going back anytime soon.
3 ||| Since Sweet Tomatoes decided to become some pay to play bull... decided to go here for a salad bar.  What a relief to find a place not trying to charge you to breathe on the food.  All you can eat for the price of a combo meal at Jack in the Box.  They have all the fixins you need to make a decent salad, and that's all you really came for anyway.  The soup tastes canned, which isn't a bad thing, and the bread is what it is.  The service was great and I will be going back.
1 ||| This was my 1st time ever eating Vietnamese food, & let me start by saying that I hate Chinese food, so you can see where I'm going with this. Maybe if I were to like these types of food, then this place wouldn't have been so bad, but for me I'd rather stay away from this type of food.\n\nFrom the outside, this looks like your normal shopping center restaurant, small & quaint. But this place is freaking huge...I was absolutely shocked. I don't know if they ever get enough people to fill it up, but they have A LOT of seating. The whole place is open, with nothing but tables & chairs throughout the whole place. No walls, decorative pieces, nothing but space & seating.\n\nI went with an old coworker that likes this type of food so he had some suggestions for me as I frowned across the menu. Maybe to a Vietnamese connoisseur this food would be appealing, but to me everything just sounded like something I'd rather not eat. I will say that while I wasn't exactly thrilled with eating the food, they do give you huge portions.\n\nSaigon Palace is not your typical shopping center restaurant, with its size really setting it apart. The food is probably good if you're in to that type of thing, but for me it just wasn't good. I'm sure you could get a seat here pretty quickly anytime of the day, for any size group, considering how abundant seating is. Vietnamese just isn't for me & I'll stay away in the future...but at least I tried it...
0 ||| US airways is just terrible. I'm so thankful for Alaska airlines. Us airways would rather let an empty seat stay empty than put me on standbye. The gate agent (who was polite) stated it would be $75 to be moved to an earlier flight and that standbye didn't exist anymore. Really??! Not only is it shitty customer service, it blatantly makes NO sense to let a seat go empty. What's wrong with upper management of airlines? If you're not going to have comfortable planes or good customer service, at least have policies that make logical sense!
1 ||| Westins almost always delight without fail, I think we just arrived at the wrong time.\n\nLocated in North Scottsdale - about 25 minutes from Old Town (where all the best spots are). The area where the Westin is is very new, and most everything is very retail/big chains oriented. It's a nice suburban area.\n\nThe service, sadly, was terrible! I don't know who is in charge of hiring and personnel management at this location, but they need to be fired. The valet service gave us the worst first impression of the hotel and made us feel incredibly unwelcome, the check-in staff was borderline rude and the concierge made a disaster of our entire evening with some of the worst recommendations I've ever gotten. It was Saturday evening and they had a prom, a wedding and a convention going on all at the same time. When we pulled up to the front the valet guys completely ignored us (you may be thinking, WELL with a prom a wedding and a convention, maybe they were busy, maybe cut 'em a little slack? I totally would have chalked it up to that but we were 1 of 3 cars there, and there were 3 valets, 2 of which were casually talking beside their stand the whole time...). Finally 1 of the 3 valet guys lazily came up to us as we were getting our bags out of our car and asked if we wanted help, we said sure and he then said okay and walked away! haha - I don't know if he didn't understand us or what, but he looked like he did. It was weird. We then lugged our bags in ourselves through the incredibly crowded lobby area to the check in desk and my husband went back to park the car. There were 4 people at the check-in desk but only 2 were actively checking people in. Then after 10 minutes of waiting in line I was told we were in the wrong building for the villas and we had to go about half mile down the road to check in (which HAD the valet dude actually been helping us, might have saved us 20 minutes of stressful overload and an overall negative first impression of this Westin.) \n\nWhen we finally did get checked in, we went to the concierge and were \"helped\" by Allan. Do NOT ask this dude for his dining recommendations, we asked him for his recommendations on a place with local-flare and high-end service. He recommended Sol Mexican Cocina (which was chain-like, had disgusting food - fish stick calamari & margaritas that they brag are made with sour mixes) and the Westin's restaurant Deseo. The restaurant Deseo is utterly underwhelming - if atmosphere and service are factors you care about in a dining experience, pass on this place.
2 ||| I've visited this location numerous times. While I understand you need an appointment to get any help at an apple store, this place is always mayhem. The staff member that assigins you an apple member is most likely told to lie to you in order to keep you waiting as long as possible - before you completely lose your patience.\nI got to the store at 10am on the dot expecting to simply buy an iPhone 4 and get on my way. The place wasn't busy at all, and I had no questions. Just charge my card $395 for the phone and mobile me, take my info and i'm gone, right? Not so fast.\nI walked out at 10:45. They said they would help me right away, and I stood waiting 25 minutes until I could be helped. Three times I was told \"someone will be right with you\". The last guy that helped me was nice ,but that didn't makeup for the experience.\nIt's sad apple is such a profitable business with such awful, understaffed customer service. If there was another option out there that was comparable, it would be a no brainer to switch.
3 ||| Overpriced and underwhelmed. The excellent waiter could not make up for for overcooked broccoli and sausage over mediocre quality pasta. Pity as I like to support the local businesses.
4 ||| Ordered within 2 mins of arriving, food arrived within 5 mins, and boy was it TASTY! Best Pho in Vegas for sure!! Was in and out in 25 mins, so it was super efficient too!\n\nWe come here every time we come to Vegas
3 ||| We booked the bus our to the west rim of the Grand Canyon for the first week of January.\nWe found a great deal online (around 140 USD per person), including a morning snack, lunch, bus from and to Las Vegas, as well as tickets for the Skywalk at the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe booking process was very easy online, and about 2 days before our tour we called in to confirm the pick-up time. We were told to be at a neighboring hotel (ours wasn't on the pick-up list, but another hotel was just across the street) at 6:05am. We arrived there on time, but were told by the hotel staff that \"the bus is usually 20 minutes late\". Not great to hear that, especially not, when you had to get up at 5:15. Around 6:25am, the bus arrived indeed, and I thought that would be the one taking us to the Canyon. I was mistaken though. The first bus only took us out of downtown Las Vegas, and brought us to a collective station where all travelers to west and south rim that booked with the company were gathered. A friendly staff member explained the further procedure to us: we would split up in two groups now (one west rim-travelers, others going to the south), then check-in (a process that only takes half a minute getting us stickers for the appropriate bus as well as the skywalk-wristbands), then have a quick breakfast, and then (finally!) leave for the Grand Canyon.\nI have to say that part of the day annoyed me, since it seemed like a long waiting period, and all I wanted is to get on the bus.\nThe breakfast snack was ok, a small orange juice and coffee as well as a danish was provided for free. After having food, the west rim travelers were asked to queue for their buses.\n\nThis is when the tour really started to be great fun.\nFirst of all, the buses are really comfortable, clean and modern. They are equipped adjustable back-rests, air conditioning and on-board toilets (which I didn't use but assume was clean like the rest of the bus).\nOur driver was by far the best driver EVER, highly entertaining and with his sympathetic jokes and laughs almost better than the canyon. All passengers were amused by his funny stories. Dwayne, most handsome of all bus drivers, we love you and we would take the tour anytime again just to hear your Sesame Street Ernie laugh! =)\n\nBut let's get back to the tour itself: There was a 15-minute stop at the hoover dam, which we could photograph from the newly constructed bridge. Great bonus, since not all bus companies stop here.\nAnother short stop took us to an Indian gift shop/supermarket in Arizona, and the last stop about 40 miles before the canyon was mandatory to change buses (the expensive buses can't go on the dirt road to the canyon, understandable).\nAfter about 4 hours in total (including the stops), we arrived at the canyon's visitor center. There, we hopped on the buses that drives a loop from the Eagle Point to Guano Point back to the visitor center.\nWe stepped out at the Eagle Point (where the Skywalk is located), and spent about 80 minutes there. Be aware that the canyon is not secured, so if you take a wrong step, you might actually end up at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Don't be a daredevil here!!! I would recommend to go to the South rim if you're planning to take children, we were told that it's more secure.\nThe Skywalk was pretty impressive, and I recommend it for new visitors, since there you can truly look down, and the photographers will take great pictures of the visitors.\nThe Eagle Point is also displaying some Native American Tipis and typical housing. Native American dances were announced, but not ongoing while we were there, so I can't report.\nNext stop was Guano Point, the nature there was even more impressive, and the views more stunning than before. We also had food there (which is included in the trip), that was pretty good.\n\nOur group was meeting at 3:30pm at the bus (we had about 4 hours at the canyon), to be taken back to Vegas (one stop to change buses). We arrived around 7pm.\n\nIt was a great day!\n\n--\nThis is a review for http://www.allgrandcanyontours.com\nAll Grand Canyon Tours\n4285 N Rancho Dr.\nLas Vegas, NV 89130\nUnited States
0 ||| We drove to a remote part of Las Vegas because we had a coupon for Buy One Entree, Get One Free -- this coupon was from the Entertainment Book, sold annually, with hundreds of participating restaurants and other businesses offering great discounts. \n\nWhen we finally arrived at the restaurant, we were starving -- we hadn't realized how far away this place was.  We entered this hole-in-the wall Chinese place -- at first, it seems just like a \"fast-food\" style order at the counter restaurant, but they had several tables available, and we were told to take a seat if we were dining in.  We were promptly greeted by a young woman, who told us that the coupon we had wasn't going to work, as they didn't have a contract with the Entertainment Book people --- we had just driven half an hour to try this place out, and they weren't going to honor our coupon!  Bleh!  They did offer a 10% discount, however, so we decided to stay, as we were really hungry.  How disappointing, however, for them not to honor a valid coupon with their name on it, that hadn't expired.  Poor business practice!\n\nOn the plus side, they had good prices, good portion sizes -- however they offered table service, yet served everything on styrofoam plates. I don't mind eating off of styrofoam, but if you're going to offer table service, go to the dollar store and buy some cheap real plates to serve your customers on!!!  \n\nThe food would get a 3.75 stars, but their customer service (in not accepting the coupon) rates them a 1 star -- we would never go back to a business that does something like this, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody else either.
3 ||| If your grandparents are in town, then they will probably like Cracker Barrel.  Very bland menu. My waitress was a little odd and really seemed unorganized with her tables.  I ordered the Uncle Herschel's Favorite .Two Eggs with Grits, Sawmill Gravy and Homemade Buttermilk Biscuits along with Real Butter and the best Preserves and Grilled Pork Chop is what's on the menu.  However, the grits were really runny, eggs overcooked, the \"grilled\" pork chop need salt nor was it grilled and the \"best\" Preserves, I have no idea what that's supposed to be.  I really don't think Uncle Herschel would like the dish!  My coffee cup was never filled until I was ready to go.  It's cheap but really not what I had expected from Cracker Barrel.
0 ||| I have mixed feelings on this place. The first time I went in the dr spent a lot of time with me and explained things out. Today the second time, I asked to have a mole removed. What I got instead is a 30 min wait in the waiting room (ironic since they have a sign that says there is a fee for missed appts) and 30 seconds with the dr. No exaggeration. Disappointed today for sure.
2 ||| This place definitely has some downsides (food that isn't exactly innovative, less-than-inspiring atmosphere), but it definitely has a lot of good things going for it too. The service is attentive, the grilled fish is fresh and very flavorful, the oysters are awesome (and we all know good oysters are hard to come by in the desert) and only cost $.95 during seafood happy hour (weeknights and weekend days), and the prices are very reasonable given the quality of the fish. \n\nMy sister and went here for lunch this past weekend. I had four Miyagi oysters (which, again, were only $.95 because it was noon on Saturday) that were perfectly briny and super-fresh. She had the side salad, which she said was good, although the house dressing had a bit of a funky taste. We both had the rainbow trout and the basil cherry tomatoes and rice for side dishes. The fish itself was so flavorful and not too greasy, although she did report that her portion had a lot of really small bones, and the rice side dish was good. I would recommend avoiding the basil tomatoes, though - even though the tomatoes themselves were fresh, they were absolutely covered in black pepper, which made them inedible. Our server was nice and kept the drink refills coming. For $40 including tip, we had two appetizers, two entrees, and a soda and left very satisfied. If you are looking for innovation or trendy atmosphere, you probably want to go elsewhere, but if you want good-quality seafood and reasonable prices, you will really enjoy the Fish Market.
2 ||| You don't need a view when your room is this big. The secrecy of Hotwire deals in \"downtown Pittsburgh\" is a situation. Their perimeter crosses into the Southside and whatever you call north of The Point across the bridge. And when you cross reference the hotels in that area on Yelp with the providers on Hotwire, you can end up in very different situations. Then, you can research the Omni price -- $190 regularly -- against the Hotwire deal $120 and it's worth the risk. \n\nLarge room. Large king bed. Large room service 24 hour menu. Large hallways. Wander them. If you're looking to pull an Aaron Sorkin in a random American city and stay in a hotel without leaving for 24 to 144 hours straight, this is your place in Pittsburgh. The expansive lobby gives you enough fresh air. The front desk staff is simple & accommodating. If you're the type to leave the hotel then it's a decent location. Just know there isn't a decent bar within 5 blocks, and you're only decent walkable option is to jaunt over to Market Square. But if it's summer time and you want to walk to PNC park for a game or the Heinz museum, it's a perfect option. \n\nAlso, robes.
2 ||| I've only been here twice. The first time I wanted to try it because I had seen the long lines out front on the weekends, and the second time because I thought the first was a fluke. \n\nBoth times the food was decent--standard breakfast fare with little flair. It was good, don't get me wrong, but didn't seem to justify the long wait.\n\nWhat was surprising about this place is that the first time I went there the server tried to tell me what to order. I was told that \"complicated\" items take too long and I would be better off getting standard items like eggs or pancakes. I understand that they want to turn over tables quickly with the long wait, but pushing people off of menu items is a big turn-off for me.\n\nThe second time I went they were out of the item I wanted. I will try to get back there during the week when it's not as busy and see if my experience is better.
0 ||| I can't comment on the food. We never got food or drinks or had a waitress acknowledge us after sitting there for 20 minutes. I won't be going back to try the food.  They blew it.
2 ||| I love any place where it seems like I'm the smartest person. Yeah I know, that's an arrogant statement.  I stand behind it.  CPCC get your learn on YO!
3 ||| Very good. I always get the Spicy Korean Chicken and Kahlua Pig Combo. The portions are huge and the food is full of flavor. The bathroom was a bit on the gross side, and the dining room could use a cleaning
1 ||| Three strikes and you're out.  Nine strikes and the inning's over.\n\nThis location's problems are mostly of its own making but the intense foot traffic only exacerbates them.\n\nThe bagels are usually acceptable but, compared to other locations, occasionally skimpy and/or undercooked.\n\nUnfortunately, staff turnover at this store seems to be a way of life and through circumstance or choice they are shorthanded by at least one counter person every visit.  The predictable result is long waits.  Placing the coffee urns behind the counter means yet more delays as staff must do the pouring.  They've got plenty of room at the coffee/tea station and it's well past time to move the coffee urns out there even if it means hauling them back to make fresh coffee occasionally, just as Panera et al must do.\n\nThis store really is the devil's candy - great location, expansive seating area, outdoor tables - but the slowness of service invariably causes one to ask 'Why bother?' especially when other Bruegger's locations without these problems are nearby.
4 ||| Love this place. I've been going to Zinc for several years and look forward to going for years to come. \n\nIt's dark?  Well yeah, that's the point! Those who are uncomfortable in the \"beautiful people\" world of North Scottsdale will not be happy. BTW they have someone the best bartenders in town. Go on a Friday afternoon/evening, sit at the corner of the bar and have fun.
0 ||| Coming from the west coast, this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food, the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea, after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass.
3 ||| I am giving 4 stars, probably 1 more than they deserve. However, after the nightmare of nastiness at the IHOP a block away...Roxys was a welcomed retreat. We had breakfast here twice. Good food (a lot of it), very clean restaurant and the servers are very nice.
0 ||| Decoration are very dusty.  Bathroom was not very clean.  After waiting for  1 hr for menudo, finally had enough of waiting.  Went to ask what was taking so long.  Informed that \"menudo was not ready\".  Checked their health department grade and they got a \"c\".  Will not be eating that menudo after all.
0 ||| Dinner& Movie: After the downpour, the thunder clapped, the lightening flashed, the skies parted and \"date night!\" arrived.  My date and I were told there was a 30-40 minute wait and after almost leaving, we made our way through the restaurant to wait in the wine bar.  Hmm a bit misleading.  It was quite humid and crowded.  I am patient and was in great company but...there were some negative moments.  On our way up the wine bar stairs,  I held the door as a hostess directed a party down the teeny stairs to their table, only to be squished by patrons coming up who thought I was there for their convenience and more than happy to hold the door as they pushed past.  Also some of  the patrons at the bar seemed displeased that new faces were coming in and did not seem to want to budge to make any room for ordering beverages.  Anyway, I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and/or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified \"thanks a lot\" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal, it was do-able.  I had a salad and the pizza with te arugula while my date hads the fpur cheese.  I loved my pizza and besides one of the cheeses my date also enjoyed his pie.  The pizza crust was slightly sweet and baked just right. (Like I said, I really enjoyed mine and the food is why I gave 3 not 2 stars.)  Thankfully my date was able to help me finish my pizza and there was some to take home.  Our waiter was nice and somewhat attentive.  I did have to hunt him down for red pepper flakes, a refill on water and our small table became quite crowed and yet he did not remove the bread basket/plates.  I grew up in Mt. Lebanon and know that sometimes the neighborhood can be a bit \"snooty-pooty\" but I would go back.  But not on a Friday night and honestly it would not be in my first choice out of the other nearby restaurants.
4 ||| 5 stars for the wide open spaces! \n\nWe all know that Starbuck's drinks are all standard, pretty much.\nSo when I look at stores I look for the outlets and the tables...I guess also the location.\n\nWhen ever you go into a Starbucks, no matter what location you instantly feel your in a different place...the company's interior design gets me every time, the insistent Feng Shui is just so relaxing and productive. Or maybe its all in my head..ha!\n\nI like this location because of the outlets and the tables...all very accommodating. \n\nI am purest so I don't mess with Carmel frapps or the peppermint mochas...tall coffee or black passion tea for me my coffee artisans of 16th st and BethHome....and let the caffeine pass through my veins...stirring my inner most career ambitions! \n\nl'chaim!    \n\nR\\_
0 ||| Went to this place while shopping for a new salon...in less than 2 weeks my brand new full set started falling apart ..2 nails totally lifted right off...that was after I told the girl I wanted them shorter her reply was \"you'll get use to them being that long\" then she started polishing them I told her the color wasn't me and I didn't want her to finish. ..her reply...\" you'll get use to it too\"....so I paid for something I did not like...their customer service sucks! ! don't waste your time or money....
4 ||| Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.
4 ||| I am fan because this was the first real feel Mexican joint I have found here in town that had a wide menu and deli that I felt like I could trust.  Great menu options, had my pozole when I wanted it (which is a plus)  the wife had tripa tacos (fried tripe) that was very good.  there is plenty of dining space and a real Mexico fell to the place.  As I understand it they have been in town for many, many years.  \n\nWhile we did not see it, it appears that they offer items cooked al carbon in their parking lot on busier days.  \n\nWe will be back.
2 ||| In regards to Cassie or \"Ricks\" comment. I tried multiple times to get in touch with someone in upper management about my experience. It's funny how a review on social media suddenly makes this important...Too little to late.
4 ||| I was a little nervous when I saw the line but I figured if there were that many people waiting it must be worth it.  Luckily the line moved quickly.  The hot dog was pretty good but the Italian sausage was one of the best I've ever had.  The fries were just so-so.  The Italian sausage will probably bring me back a few more times.
4 ||| This place never fails to amuse me. I can go out there (a drive, but worth it), get a beer and some greasy food and sit to watch all the people walk by all dressed up with fake accents and bowing to the \"king\" and \"queen\". Not to mention when we go on Pirate's weekend... then there's a whole new set of people to stare at!\n\nFood and drinks are a tad pricy, but it's a fair/festival, so that's to be expected. I paid $5 for an Ace Pear Cider and $4 for a slice of pizza. Tickets aren't cheap either but if you go to Fry's beforehand you can save a couple of bucks. Helps pay for your gas!
0 ||| Read \"previous review\" first.  \n\nSeveral years ago I had the pleasure of meeting and listening to Scott Waddle.  He was a Commander in the U.S. Navy and the captain of the USS Greeneville.  While Scott was in control of the submarine he hit a ship from Japan that had high school kids and crew on it.  Lots of them died.  Google it if you want.  Why am I writing this you might ask.  Good question.  I am writing this to explain how important it is to take responsibility for your actions.  That is what Scott did and he now does speaking engagements to try to get people to do the same thing (take responsibility for your actions).  As a business owner you have to take responsibility for not only your own actions but those of your employees too.  I am happy to say that the owner of Airpark Auto Service did this (kind of).  \n\nI told my friend that he needed to speak with the owner so that he could get everything off his chest.  Seeing how he had been going there for a long time he could only think about all the other times he had probably been ripped off.  Well, he had a meeting with the owner and they had a conversation about what happened, and she took responsibility for the actions of her employees and told my friend that they were in the wrong.  She refunded my friend the money that they charged him and I hope she had a long conversation with her employees.  I am guessing that she was pissed that her employees were caught red handed, but who knows.  If it were me I would have lost trust in all the employees involved and fired them!  But lets be honest, this is something lots of shops do;  They take advantage of people.  Here my friend had been a loyal customer for a long time and was about to get ripped off by a shop that he emphatically trusted and referred people to.\n\nI guess all this means is that I am glad that the owner of Airpark Auto Service took responsibility for the actions of her employees but I still would not trust this shop!  Once trust is lost it is very hard to get back!  Almost impossible.
3 ||| I mean, go here when school is out -- you'll get better food. Welcome to 75% of Oakland.\n\nI'm boring and usually get Chicken Lo Mein. Other menu items are more hit and miss, so I gave up trying new things and just go with that. The chicken is always my favorite part - it's always tender and not dried out. \n\nSure you can find more authentic, but it's cheap, decent food. And remember, when school is out...
4 ||| Food is super killer here. My fav (since I'm not a beef eater): Fish Jun! But, based on other friend-made recommendations, you are probably still good trying either Jun; it's just so good!  I love the fact that they serve boiled peanuts when you dine-in too.  It reminds me of back home in Hawaii when boiled peanut was eaten so frequently that it was pretty much a staple already.\n\n\nHawaii-style Korean grubs done right.  Chill vibe, good grubs, and the ever present aloha-style hospitality.  Always a treat!  Mahalos guys!!
4 ||| Yes, it's a chain mexican restaurant & having so many choices in the Valley, I should be ashamed to go here, but I've been eating here for YEARS.  The service is generally very good, servers are friendly and quick, and the food is consistently good.\n\nI love their salsa and bean dip they bring out with chips.  A little bit of bean dip + a lot of salsa = a happy mouth.
4 ||| Nice restaurant, wonderful concept with the wine store and the wine prices are great.  We loved the atmosphere and will definitely head back to sit outside.  We were the only table inside due to the outside seating being open but we had nice service and very good food. The only negative was the portion sizes were all over the place with some appetizers being the same size as the entrees.  I think they could bolster a few dishes even with the use of greens or more of the starch and the value perception would increase dramatically. When considering the price and portion size this restaurant really ends up being about the same as many of the higher end restaurants on the strip. I don't have a problem with this but feel they may be hurting themselves by becoming more of a special occassion restaurant vs. a weekly haunt for some. We also met the owner and she was a lovely person and we look forward to getting to know her in the future.  THUMBS UP!
0 ||| After reading all the reviews I am wondering if we were in the same place. Usually when I go to a restaurant I can say the food tastes (good or bad), but going tonight we had food that had no taste. My boys had the brats and they tasted like water, no spices AT ALL! While the cabbage was good ( and also the service), I think the gravy, rye bread and cheese were bought off the rack from across the street....nothing German about it! \n\nConsidering that two adults and two young boys had dinner and drinks ( soda and two very small beers) we had a $50 bill. It is not enough any more to just put out tasteless food, even if it was an off night.
3 ||| This place is affectionately called the \"soupy burro\" around the office. On my way there, my fellow lunchies warned about three things:\n\n1)Be cautious of the aluminum plate they serve the burro in, its 2 degrees hotter than the deepest realm of hell and will singe your arm hair if you get too close. \n\n2)The enchilada style burro with a side of beans is two parts molten lava, one part devils breath and two parts awesome. Be warned.\n\n3)If you happen to get the burro traditional (without enchilada sauce) try it Gary style.(He's a guy a work) Get a side of rice with your burro and eat directly over the rice bowl because the burro WILL explode  at some point and it is better to catch the molten lava goodness with your rice than on your pants. Unless you want to melt your legs off.\n\nAll in all, it is good stuff. Small menu, outside seating, cash only, No sign on the building. Sometimes you have to arm-wrestle a junk-yard dog for a place to sit but its worth it.
4 ||| Have you ever had their wings here??? It's a must. Some may say it's a little sweet, but it has the sweet and tangy mixture fried to perfection. I LOVE their wings. (it's their special sauce ;) ) \n\nWe also had the salmon platter, which was ok. Standard. I liked the macaroni salad. I always enjoy that here. \n\nThey say they don't sell the manapau (sp? - char sui bao/sweet pork bun) on Sundays, but we asked, and they had it and made it for us. I remember it being a little better before, but maybe because we didn't eat it right away... it got a little hard and wasn't as good as I remembered. Oh well, lesson learned - eat the pau right when it comes out - hot and fresh. \n\nEmployee at the counter was very friendly. I was with a big group and she was very accommodating. It's a nice simple, casual place to eat. Good for a laid back place. Homey feel. Me likes!
3 ||| A very fun experience for me and my family.  To be fair, the exhibits that come in on special rotation are pretty fun too.  One challenge, if you are bringing your family or group, the cafeteria prices are a bit on the exploitive (captive audience) side of the economic scale.  : )  Not a good value in this department.\n\nFriendly help generally, and sometimes enough security walking around to make you think that gang warfare is going to break out.  Better too much than not enough I guess.
0 ||| The description said...\"cheesy creamed spinach served with warm chips\".  What I received was \"milky spinach served with room temperature chips\".  The dip would not even sit on the chip. It ran off. Nothing remained on the chip. The chips were fresh though.  I used to enjoy this restaurant and the atmosphere.  It's not the same.  There was no service with a smile nor was there a thank you please come again. Just my bill and the server disappeared. That's exactly what I'll do...and I won't return.
2 ||| I guess you could call this a minimalist approach. Garfield Artworks is essentially a big white room used to display art on its four walls or a venue for bands playing on a stage at the far end. There are a few chairs alone the walls and that's about it.\n\nI came here the other night to see a band. The acoustics aren't the greatest, but the small venue setting seemed to work. Most events are BYOB so keep that in mind. \n\nI checked out a lot of the posters for upcoming shows and events and most seem to be a little left of the norm, which is cool and what they seem to be going for.  Everyone comments on the absurdity of the bathroom and rightfully so. It is a complete dungeon.\n\nAs for people saying it is in a sketchy area of town, I just gotta say \"M is for melodrama\". Penn Avenue is perfectly safe as long as you aren't stumbling drunk and/or being a complete asshole.
2 ||| This middle eastern/mediterranean restaurant and Husnu's are really twins, located adjacent to each other on State Street.  I recall them as having both been fairly mediocre and unmemorable restaurants.  Maybe they both survive because people get a kick out of how extraordinarily similar and mediocre they are.
3 ||| Mehhh.  I'll be honest... I expects a bit more.  The food was mediocre.  I had a filet which was a little over cooked and I got it Oscar (with asparagus and crab meat and bernaise) and it was cold.  Is that how is done?  I'm seriously asking because that was my first time... If it is I'm not a fan.  Mickey and Mooch get brownie points for being kid friendly.  The kids loved their food and having a really nice server but the food was nothing special.  I left feeling like we could have had the same meal, at chilis next door for way less money.  Another plus is the turtle pond and fountain on the side.  The kids enjoyed that as well
2 ||| Fish fry review - quick summary: if you're looking for a high quality, no-frills fish fry, Bridges On The Green will satisfy your needs.  We recently visited them and found the fish (baked cod, beer battered cod) to be excellent.  Nice portions of super high quality fish.  Batter was light, crispy, and not the least bit greasy.  Sides were excellent as well.  Service and atmosphere left us a bit unimpressed, but the fish was so good that we'll be back.\n\nFull review available on my site (along with photos and more details).  Check my profile for a link.
2 ||| I got the Chicken Panini.  True, the day was hot and maybe that is why I ended up with food poisoning (i.e. chicken storage and/or prep).  Still not well after a week.   I won't go back  because I can't trust their kitchen.   Suggest sticking to the smoothies...\n\nP.S.   the people were not friendly in the customary way:  You know, the  \" hi , glad you dropped in\"  smile
3 ||| The staff here is awesome!  Great bar just off of state street that always has great prices on food and drinks.  If you want some good food without spending too much from a great staff this place is for sure worth a try.
3 ||| This is by far my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.  It's hidden away in an interesting area or dare I say in the ghetto (aka as Sahara and Commerical Center), but worth the drive.  \n\nIf you're vegetarian or vegan and you haven't been to Komol, then I really don't know what you've been eating.  This place is heaven on earth for us folk.  I've tried most everything on their vegetarian menu and I must say I love the orange tofu best.  It's crispy, tasty and filling.  Any Thai dish you can think of, they make a vegetarian or vegan varierty.  Duck? Check. Chicken? Check.  Soy of course...  \n\nThis place can get busy and service can be a little slow, but where they lack in speed, they make up with excellent customer service.
1 ||| I had been looking forward to trying this steak house for a year; however, I won't be returning.  First, we were seated at a 2 top table near the entry of the room.  No table should be placed here, so servers and diners kept nearly running us over.  It made for many disruptions.  \n\nThe really upsetting factor was the service.  We waited for 20 minutes to receive our beverages.  We waited another 20 minutes to receive the soup course.  The same occurred with the entrees.  There were never apologies from the server.  \n\nMy husband and I ordered the filets prepared medium.  Mine was well done, and his was medium - well to well done.  Since I had learned they moved so slowly there, I just forced it down.  It was very tough.  I also had an order of steak fries.  I'm convinced they were the pre-frozen Ore-Ida kind.  They were burnt and had absolutely no seasoning, not even salt.  I have digestive issues, so they would have been hard for me to digest.  I explained this to the server and asked for a batch that wasn't quite over-cooked.  She came back 20 minutes later with an identical set and said that if they cooked them any less the would be too cold in the middle.  This reinforced my belief they were frozen.  I make steak fries at home all the time, and you can do so without making them burnt to a crisp if they are actually fresh cut.  With the price of the meal, they should use fresh-cut fries.  My husband isn't picky at all, but even he said there was no point in wasting the calories to eat them because they were bland and too hard.\n\nWhen the check arrived I was shocked she had charged me for the steak fries, even after I communicated I probably wouldn't be able to eat the new batch either.  Also, I had ordered lemonade and realized that for my  2 lemonades ( I ordered a refill), I was charged $2 per lemonade.  I was never told there was not a free refill.  Also, the small glass was 90% ice each time.  My husband was also charged a $1.50 up charge for ordering french onion soup even though the menu said that all entrees come with  \"choice of soup or salad & vegetable.\"  When he pointed this out, the server did take it off the bill for us, but confirmed they do charge an up-charge.  She didn't explain why that wasn't on the menu.\n\nWe will not be returning.  We get much better service at Flemings for the same price.  I had high expectations for this old time supper club that is locally owned, but I was sadly disappointed.  It put a damper on our Valentine's Day celebration...
0 ||| Pho Kim Sucks!\n\nI really hate to write bad reviews but.. I am so scared to eat pho now ever since I've ate here.. The bo vien was not good at all. It didn't even taste like legit Vietnamese meatballs... It tasted so artificial and Americanized?... \n\n\nAlso, the waiter asked us if we wanted a large or small but when the bill came out, the small bowl of pho was the same price as the large.... Uhhhhh what?.. \n\n\nI think this place is all just hype. There's nothing special about it besides the catchy name. The restaurant looks nice but food? Ehh... My friend is a true pho lover and can eat pho 1-2x a week and even she didn't like this place.... If you're a true pho lover, you'll know what real pho taste like..
4 ||| We hired them to clean my elderly parents home. They were resistant to have strangers come in. The crew were very nice to them and my folks were thrilled by the results.
2 ||| This review is based on To-go food only. Not dining in. However I feel that it would be the same if I had dined in. If I ever do, I will make sure to update this review. \nI am somewhat picky with my Thai food. I want it flavorful and spicy. I felt that Komol lacked a little bit of both. \nI ordered the Pad Kee Mao noodles and the Garlic and pepper chicken. Both level 8 in heat.\nI really liked the flavor of the noodles, but the spice was not there. I would consider this a level 2 - 3 at other places. That is my biggest pet peeve when dining Thai. You are suppose to have the spiciest of foods, level 8 should BURN!! \nThe chicken was ok, but more garlicky that peppery. And again, NOT SPICY ENOUGH. One of the reasons I tried this place was because on their website they brag about the spice level and that they can \"heat you up\". \nUm, was that false advertising? Maybe I have to ask for the extra heat level? \nThe food had potential, but just didn't hit the spot, CLOSE, but not quite. \nI would like to add that the service was exactly what I would want. Friendly people who help you pronounce the dishes correctly and answer questions when asked. Both the woman who took my order over the phone as well as the person at the counter were extremely friendly.  \nI wouldn't say I will never come again, but I will try to be more specific when ordering if so. Try to find that heat level they brag about.
2 ||| I don't get all the hype surrounding chicken and waffles.  This is my second time trying it and I liked the waffle, and I liked the fried chicken, I just didn't think the combination was as orgasmic as other people seem to.  On another note, the corn bread is delicious!
1 ||| Ran out of biscuits before the end of breakfast hours, and that's not cool.  Staff was reasonably polite about it though.  Quite a bit of riff-raff as far as customers go, but maybe that's just the area.  Ton of pepper in the eggs.  What the heck?
3 ||| I started coming here to get my perscription when my new insurance made me. So I wasnt very happy about the change to begin with.  My disappointment continued as almost every single time I go to pick up my perscriptions (they are on auto refill) I wait 15 - 20 mins because the line is so long. \n\nThe store it's self is great to stop in quickly and pick up stuff. They are always friendly The parking lot is small but I almost always find parking.
0 ||| This was my second attempt at getting a deal here which is elusive at best. Even with insurance, 2 pairs of glasses cost us over $200. This is the first pair of glasses I've bought since age 14 that did NOT fit properly at all! I'm trying to calm down before I go back to fix this fiasco. The glasses in 1 hour does not exist. You can ask and get your hand slapped. Go ahead. You're a big girl. \n\nLast time I was there, I made the mistake of getting my exam at Red Rock Eye Care. I had a $10 copay for an exam and they tried to charge me $150 for me and my son, NOT including contact Rx! We were the only people there and forced to wait with an antsy 3 year old for over an hour. Then they didn't want to give me the Rx's until we cam back for another visit to check contact fitting! Total BS scam! \n\nThen we exited eye doctor room into store where eyeglass world employees-all dudes-were hypnotized by twerk videos on YouTube. Classy.
2 ||| the OLD spaghetti factory is by far my guiltiest pleasure. lets face it the food isn't that great, and on more then 5 occasions i have been here and it seemed like the entire bussing staff was on a smoke break.\n\ngrowing up in the willo district as a child my mother took me to the Spaghetti factory alot. i remember sitting in the trolly and the entire 86-88 suns team was in the building \"helping\" out. signing autographs and what not. sure was fun as a kid.\n\nnow that i'm older i just have those memories to make me say this place isn't all bad. \n\nthe mizthra cheese and butter on some noodles is still delish. the meat sauce is decent to great. the pesto ranch dressing is pretty good..to bad the lettuce is either still soaking wet, or dry and disgusting. \n\nas a phoenix institution for decades i wish this place was better. maybe someday someone will come in and turn it around..but as a \"chain\" restuarant i don't see that happening. either way..for nostalgia i'll still eat here on a quirky whim. but i will not go out of my way to eat here.
2 ||| If you want a roofing company that knows what they're doing (&, obviously, all of us do, right?), takes the time to make sure YOU know what they're doing & why they're doing it, & most importantly, won't try to swindle those of us who know nothing about roof durability & proper repair techniques, then Lyons Roofing is the company you want in your corner.  A very informative project specialist (Lou Ann) came by two days after my initial request for an appointment to assess damage to some clay tiles on the exterior portion of our complicated roof (pitches here, valleys there & flat, rolled roof areas on yet another portion) & to scope out a rather suspicious bulge in our interior kitchen ceiling.  She (yes, I said \"she\") came to the appointment prepared with a Google Earth color printout of our roof with the problem areas highlighted based on the cursory info I had given the wonderful person (Katherine) with whom I spoke with initially to schedule the appointment.  After getting the lay of the land by viewing the ceiling areas corresponding to the exterior distressed areas, she got on the roof, took lots of pictures & closely explored the questionable areas.  Once she'd thoroughly assessed the entire situation, she showed me the pics & explained what my builder had originally done, what she would recommend & how these adjustments would fare over time taking into consideration the penetrating Arizona heat & how long-term sun exposure could affect the repairs, etc.  Each person I came in contact with from Lyons was extremely professional & very accommodating.  When planning for the repairs, they were very mindful of my budget & considered every aspect of the job to make sure it fell in line with exactly what we originally discussed with no surprises in the end.  This is the company you want making repairs to your roof - they have the knowledge & expertise to get the job done right & don't attempt to take advantage of the lesser experienced homeowner.
4 ||| I was introduced to this place nearly a year ago by some co-workers. Outstanding! I have been several times and will continue to return. Although it has been a little while since I have visited Pho So, the waitress recognized me and asked if I wanted my usual, the steak salad with fresh veggies and rice. The steak is tender and juicy with just enough seasoning and spice. The egg rolls were fantastic as an appetizer. Definitely one of my better dining experiences. It's usually busy at lunch time, but it's never an issue with the attentive and efficient staff. The food is always served up fast and fresh.
0 ||| We live in Southern California and when we were in Las Vegas my child had to be taken by ambulance to the ER. The experience was the most horrifying of our lives and I would not recommend this hospital to anyone. My child was admitted for 12 days. We were never even offered a blanket or a cup of coffee by anyone. My child was taken for wrong tests, given lab draws that were meant for other patients, NEVER had her pain controlled. We overheard the staff in the ER talking about other patients. They were especially unkind about the patients with mental illness or alcoholism. They talked about every woman who came in with abdominal pain stating in various ways that she must have a sexually transmitted disease. The nurses and doctors were rude and demeaning to the patients and treated most with varying levels of disrespect.  I understand that the facility is a county hospital but there is no excuse for treating any human being regardless of the problem without dignity. I have been to a county hospital in Southern California before (at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center) when one of my children had a skiing accident. Despite the county designation we were treated with respect, compassion and dignity.
0 ||| They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they \"were already at the airport\". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns
0 ||| Guys, WTF?  Ate here because of the great reviews on yelp.  Ended up throwing away basically all of our food.  The meats were all chewy and grossly over-battered.  It was highly disgusting and mostly inedible.  I blame yelp for wasting my boyfriends $40 and calories on this crap.
1 ||| Nice ER, staff, and hospital. My issue with them was that they misdiagnosed my condition while I was out in Vegas traveling. But then again no one could have accurately diagnosed my sickness including several doctors here in California.
4 ||| I had never been to CDT before but I didn't think it looked that fancy from the outside.  It also wasn't fancy on the inside, but I felt underdressed compared to the other patrons and I showed up by myself with a book...which also made me feel a little out of place once inside.  However, the staff was very friendly and the food is excellent.  Yes, the place is small and on a busy night, I would think it could get cramped.  Yes, as another reviewer pointed out, I was able to hear all the conversations around me.  Since I wasn't trying to talk to anyone myself, I didn't find this annoying.  However I did find it strange/disappointing that the restaurant is BYOB.  Unfortunately, I came empty handed.  Now, to the important thing:  the food.  FABULOUS!  And expensive.  I had the onion tarte as an appetizer.  It came with a small salad on the side.  The tarte was excellent...it reminded me of a very fine quiche.  On the waitresses recommendation I ordered the cod as an entr\u00e9e.  It is not the cod that is visible on the online menu.  I think it might have been the best fish I've ever had in a restaurant.  It was cooked perfectly and the asparagus/vegetable medley (or whatever it was) that it was served over was to die for.  I completed my meal with a fruit tarte and cup of tea.  Again, the torte was exquisite.  Their food really is amazing.  But with the tip, my meal came to $76.  A little pricey.  My boyfriend was shocked when I told him how much my meal cost.  But the food is truly amazing and I will definitely be going back...and taking him.  But probably only for a special occasion and only when I have a bottle or two of wine in hand.  If you don't mind spending money on a beautiful meal, you should definitely try this place.
4 ||| I'ts good to see people say good things about this place. I've been a regular for years. Real nice joint, friendly folks, great beer . They'll even give you a drink on your birthday. Slante!
2 ||| Same great happy hour and food as the central location.  I did not note a difference in the food between both locations.  \nArcadia has a nice outdoor patio, I prefer the tables that sit halfway outside and halfway inside.  See if you can get one when you visit.  Enjoy anything with fig on it. :)
4 ||| I am definitely a fan of this place!! I always have a good time here, decent service, decent priced drinks, good dancing vibe, Beautiful people...great place to be at, the whole lobby is opened for the after hours crowd as well as the pool area as well so finding a place to seat is NEVER a problem here.
4 ||| This place looks a little plain from the outside but the interior is really nice, well decorated and very comfortable! \n\nThey have an awesome wine selection and the food is really good! The eggplant appetizer was AWESOME. They have an extensive pizza menu as well as a lot of regular entrees.\n\nIf you live in chandler, Mesa or tempe I would recommend giving it a try!
0 ||| Boy was I disappointed and embarrassed. I had friends visiting from out of state, and I told them that Honey Bear's was the best bbq in town. We arrived Sunday night around 7pm. They were out of ribs...My friends ordered the rib and chicken combo. One substituted the rib tips for the ribs,  and the other friend ordered sliced beef. I ordered a half lb of pulled pork and two sides. They ended up \"finding\" some ribs for one of the orders, but there were obviously boiled or pressure-cooked and not slow smoked.. The chicken came out 10 minutes after the rest of the food, and it was also either microwaved or pressure cooked.. My food, (which was ordered a couple of minutes after theirs) took over 30 minutes to arrive.  I overheard them telling the people sitting behind me that they were out of almost everything..\n\nThen, to top it all off, we were overcharged.  We showed them a four square check in which was supposed to get me one free side, but I was still charged for both my sides. The cashier girl was new and obviously in WAY over her head. \n\nI was so embarrassed after raving about this place, to have it be so very bad...
4 ||| My first visit to the Arizona Human Society was just a few weeks ago when I volunteered with Yelp to help do some gardening on the premises. First of all, I had no idea there were gardens, but I was excited nonetheless to check the place out!\n\nThe facility is very organized, clean, and had a warm feeling throughout as you entered. All workers and volunteers were all smiles. You knew the instant you walked in that people are there united for one cause, helping animals of all shapes and sizes! \n\nThe cats have a couple of \"family rooms\" where they can stretch their paws out and chill as if they were already in an actual home. The dogs have several acres to roam and investigate each day, as volunteers dedicate their time to playing with them as well as walk them. There's even an agility course outside for the dogs to do! Apparently the pitbull mixes, I was told, are actually quite good at doing the agility course. \n\nThe grounds include a mausoleum for pets. Donators can have plants, bricks, and animal quarters all dedicated in honor of passed loved ones close by to the mausoleum. (FYI - it was called something else other than a mausoleum, but it's basically similar, but for pets!)\n\nThere's a clinic, onsite, for more afforable pet medical care. There's a store as well that sells pet food, pet supplies, and souvenirs that all benefit taking care of the animals at the facility.\n\nBetween the two properties of the Arizona Humane Society, there are about 120 animals that come in each day. It's heart breaking to know that there are that many orphans that need care and are homeless. Unlike people, they cannot completely tell their stories. Each animal just desperately wants attention and to be loved. By volunteering just 8 hours a month, you can make a huge difference even if you are unable to adopt one of your own. I look forward to coming back and helping out again.
3 ||| This is our go-to restaurant when we want to eat out.  It has seen me through two pregnancies and the pho and spring roll cravings, our kids love eating there, and we have never been disappointed.\n\nThe food is consistently high in quality and flavor.  Both my husband and I love the spring rolls, pho, and bun noodle bowls.  My kids enjoy everything they've had there (which is quite a variety) and my 3 year old loves the pho the best.  \n\nI have eaten at easily 20 different Vietnamese restaurants and this is in my top two.  \n\nSometimes the service is gruff, and they are slow with carry-outs.
2 ||| I've done everything from mountain biking, to short hikes, to all day hikes in South Mountain. And first let me say that I feel that I've yet to really get into even a fraction of what South Mountain has to offer.\n\nFirst off, the BEST place to get information on South Mountain is at HikeArizona.com. For SM specifically, go here http://hikearizona.com/traildex.php?ID=34&sRID=52&SHOW=YES\n\nI've done all or parts of the Mormon Loop, Guadalupe Ridgeline, Desert Classic, Pima East Loop, Pima West Loop, Javalina, Dirt Road, National, Geronimo, and Telegraph Pass. In other words, I've been on many of the eastern trails but haven't even touched the western trails. I need to get on that!\n\nWith that said, these ARE shared trails. You very well may encounter mountain bikers on these trails. Some of them are VERY inconsider it and go racing down and run over everything. If I remember correctly, a lot of people consider SM as a mecca of mountain biking and some even train for competitive mountain biking here. And from my experience, it is pretty good for mountain biking... even though I suck at it.\n\nWith that said, I am more of a hiker. I enjoy getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city and mountain bikers nearly riding by and clipping your ankle can be a bit bleh of this mountain. I want peace and quiet, yo! So I am going to say this... if you're looking for solitude, you may not find it here - especially when the weather is nice and on the weekends. If you want solitude, you'd be better off in the White Tank Mountains, especially if you can muster a 14mile trip... or the Superstitions. Neither of those places have I ever encountered mountain bikers (The White Tanks actually has a designated area for bikes). Likewise, Piestawa and Camelback mountains are always packed with people.\n\nSo, know your goal. If it just for exercise, the South Mountain is one of my favorite, partially because it is close to my house. If I want no people then it is Superstitions or White Tanks.\n\nThis should go without saying, but bring water. Let me correct myself, bring more water than you think you'll ever need. Arizona is notorious for dehydrating people. I personally bring a Camelbak 3L (100oz) filled completely up with water. I also bring a few flashlights/headlamps just in case I find the sun setting on me when I'm still out there.\n\nWhich reminds me... I've done numerous night hikes with the moon on SM. I actually didn't need a night except a few times where I wanted to make sure of my footing. So, if you aren't afraid of the dark... I highly suggest going hiking at night! It also gives a WONDERFUL view of the big sprawling city we call home - Phoenix. It's view off the National and Geronimo is supa-dupa awesome.\n\nWith that said, I give this trail a 5 star only because I think it offers so much and has a lot of diversity. It's not a trail system that you get into and go \"oh ****\" a mile in and have to turn back. There are so many options to match your skill level and desired activity that it almost seems ridiculous. It may take a few times going to get a trail route figured out that you like (right amount of people, no bikes, good views, etc.) but once you do then it is golden.\n\nOn an impersonal note, parking can be busy during peak times. And, the gates close at sunset. You can still drive out after dark though. Park is dog friendly but please pack out what you pack in (I'm talking about dog poop here).\n\nEnjoy and see you out on the trail!
0 ||| Awful.  We rented a car and, when we got to the counter, there was an hour+ wait just to do the paper work.  There must have been 40 people mulling around waiting for their number to be called.  We left, went to another rental agency and had a car with in 10 minutes.  Did it cost more?  Yes, however my vacation is very short, and I did not want to spend 2 hours of it at Budget.  Never again.
0 ||| I'm not often one to write reviews simply cutting a place down but Walmart earned it. I genuinely don't know how they still remain in business with the poorest customer service I've ever experienced.\n\nI ordered a TV during black Friday. It came in to this location and I went to pick it up. I unpack it and notice the TV has a massive dent in it. The box has a massive dent in it and I just never noticed.\n\nFail #1: I call the Walmart.com help line and explain the situation hoping they can order another one. I know there are no more in stores. I am quite bluntly told to hang up and go to Walmart. They cannot help me.\n\nFail #2: I know they don't have any others in stores but I call this store anyway. This guy in electronics says they have one. I say, \"you're sure, it's XXXX model? In xx\" size?\" He says \"yes.\" I ask, \"you're sure? Let me confirm with you again. Please check.\" He says \"Yes, looking right at it.\" I ask him to set it aside and wait for me to come down for an exchange. I get there, and one hour later I finally am able to find an employee to find me the TV. Well, it wasn't the same size, or the same model. The employee says, \"oh, my bad.\" He didn't listen to a word I said over the phone. Two other employees got involved in looking for a TV they never asked me any details about. There appears to be literally no inventory to just type some numbers into. No organizational system. Nothing.\n\nFail #2: Finally, an assistant manager gets involved, named Brian. Brian orders the TV for me and says it should be in within days and he'll call me when it has arrived. He leaves but took none of my information.\n\nFail #3: I physically return to Walmart to see if the TV arrived two days later. A manager appears and tells me that no TVs are coming. I clarify that an assistant manager helped me order another one. She makes me sound like I don't know what I'm talking about, takes my information down while saying she'll call me back by the end of the day with comparable TVs to exchange for. I don't get a call.\n\nFail #4: I call them and ask for Brian the next day. After some information exchange and hold time, Brian says he has the TV. I am ecstatic. I haul my TV back in for a second time to exchange. I'm told to go to electronics to pick it up. An employee with attitude redirects me to the merchandise pickup counter. Unsurprisingly, the employee there knows nothing of what I'm asking. She phones in for a manager. I wait and wait.\n\nFail #5: I call Brian again by calling the Walmart main number again. He says he'll have it brought to customer service up front. 20 minutes later, it shows up. At this point, a simple exchange should get me in and out. I assumed this was a task any of the 3 employees involved in the process could handle but just as I had experienced thus far - nobody knows what they're doing. I was stunned at the lack of simple problem solving skills by everyone. 45 minutes of scanning, voiding, printing, voiding, scanning, voiding. I genuinely cannot fathom how this was any more challenging than any other exchange process. It was terrifying. Brian came by and had to clarify that I don't need to pay more than what I already pre-paid because it's just an exchange. Why would that even need to be clarified? He voided a transaction or two that were messed up. Two other service managers were voiding transactions repeatedly as well.\n\nI lost about 3-4 hours of my life waiting for incompetent people to figure out what was going on with registers, inventory, and communication. I was talked down to as if I didn't know what I was talking about numerous times. If it wasn't for the assistant manager named Brian, I would have never completed the process. There would be no replacement TV, and any replacement I'd request would never be found. Absolutely unacceptable. I will never step foot into a Walmart again.
1 ||| Basha is sort of like a Safeway, but not as great. We went here to do an alcohol run and also some chips and dips. The aisle were nicely organized and the workers were really helpful and friendly. Only problem is, they don't exactly have everything that we were looking for, which was really disappointing. They did not carry white cranberry juice and straws for mixed drinks. So we had to drive across the street to Albertson's where we were able to find both!
0 ||| Walk inside to see hear Spanish music, see quite a few Spanish magazines and TV guides laying around and the cashier spoke very broken English but could speak Spanish. Kind of an odd way to put together a Japanese food establishment in my opinion but I ordered anyway.\n\nI got a chicken teriyaki bowl, a california roll, and crab puffs. The chicken teriyaki bowl was the only thing that I could actually eat. The california rolls were about an inch across and took four bites to eat and even then were dry, bland and was 90% rice. Sushi is supposed to be bite sized. The crab puffs were large but the filling was just horrible. It tasted like they had sat in the freezer for a month before they fried them using old oil.\n\nOverall the prices are high for what you get, the food is pretty horrible, and the service is meh. The cashier had to point to my total because he couldn't say it in English. I won't be going back again.
3 ||| Stayed here two nights in February and it was perfect for my needs.  Plus I got the room through priceline for $40.  I am so cheap.\nSleep number bed was great (and kinda fun to play with..).  Pretty standard room.  Clean and didn't stink.  Couldn't get the WiFi to work but maybe that was me.  Just used the hardwire.  Ok, so I couldn't lie on the bed and do my work.  Whatever.\nDidn't try the restaurant.  I always ended up at Panera just down the street.\nDidn't try the pool/hot tub.  For some odd reason, I didn't think to bring my swimsuit to WI in February.  Anyway, I peeked in there on Friday eve. and there was a dude with big moobs sitting in the hottub.  No thanks.  But it looked clean.  The \"exercise facility\" was basically a converted room, but there were a couple machines and a tv and it was empty and didn't stink so ok.\nIt was more crowded on Friday but still quiet enough for me to sleep.  Other than a couple elephants running in the hall earlier in the evening, I didn't hear anything.
4 ||| Have driven past the place for years, always thought it was a coffee shop or something, LOL. A friend who told me and recommended it highly, he was absolutely right. The store is really clean and nice looking, the people working there are great, and of course the ice dessert is FANTASTIC. Every time I am in Tempe I stop and try a different flavor, they have a LONG list to choose from.  Truthfully the only suggestion would be adding signage that tells people what it is they actually sell.  I have since recommended it friends and every one of them has thanked me,  They do not accept credit cards and have a minimum on debit cards, however I can understand that, that service is not free to the owner. I think the store, the product and the people all are a \"job well done\".Best dessert in az /arizona
2 ||| I don't typically shop at Smith's anymore and when I do, it's not normally at this location. I stopped in after work to grab some ingredients for dinner along with a few other staples. Just inside the door was a rack of hot and fresh french bread. I was already thinking spaghetti for dinner and the french bread kind of sealed the deal. I spent the rest of my time in the store smelling the bread and it was all I could do to keep from eating it while I shopped. The store was busy, but not extremely crowded. The produce section was fully stocked and everything looked fresh. This location has a large selection of meat, complete with a full service meat counter. Smith's carries a yogurt called Carb Master and this location had a better variety than my regular Smith's store. This is an older location, but it is well kept and the staff is friendly. I even found a fog machine on sale in the seasonal section, which couldn't have worked out better, as my other one petered out three days before the opening of my haunted garage. When I got ready to check out and headed for the registers, the lines were starting to form. They opened up additional checkstands and I was out in a jiffy.
2 ||| I just didn't have the same experience that other people did.\n\nI ordered the link, the brisket, and the ribs.  All three were dry.  I'm enclosing a picture.  I saw DDD and Guy holds up one of the links to the camera to show the juices coming out but mine was nothing like that.  Most reviews say the food is moist so I'm guessing that I got a bad batch.  A couple of less than average reviews say the meat was dry so maybe I was one of the unlucky ones.\n\nOne thing I noticed right off the bat was that the food is kept in warming bins, which was surprising.  When the server took off the lid to the links they just didn't look very appetizing.  I noticed from other reviews is that a lot of other people ordered items that had sauce in it, like the pulled pork or the cut links.  Maybe if you get 3 items that have no sauce there's nothing there to give it moisture.\n\nThe mac & cheese was good; I don't usually like since it never really lives up to the promise, but this serving did.  Very good overall.\n\nThe staff were friendly.  I arrived at 11:30 and avoided most of the rush.  I was the 2nd person in line when I ordered, but when I got outside the line was out the door.  I arrived earlier to try to get more \"fresh\" product but that's just not what I got.
2 ||| This is a nice place to come and see the monarch butterfly exhibit and learn about the various types of desert plants and how they survive and acclimate to the desert. Also did insect inspection camp which was fun for the kids. Great teacher to student ratio for the camp.
3 ||| Went there for the first time on Friday and it was so yummy. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was just because we didn't get to try everything we wanted to because they had already sold out. Sold out of all their pitas, all deserts and one of the soups. We will definitely go earlier next time to try the items we missed out on. We tried the sausage and cabbage rolls and both were very good. The place is also nice and clean. Always a good thing.
3 ||| My wife and I recently dined at Miro Spanish Grille located in the Stonecrest Shopping Center on Rea Road. We stopped by rather late in the evening as our schedule just doesn't seem to completely accommodate the normal dinner hour. No matter, we were welcomed into the restaurant. \n\nWe started with a fantastic appetizer. Here's your secret tip - this item isn't on the menu. Although they have removed it from the menu, they have the ingredients and don't mind pulling it together at all. \"IT\" is the Piquillos. These are sweet peppers from Spain stuffed with goat cheese covered with a terrific sauce! My favorite! \n\nI had grilled Mahi Mahi for the main course which was a special and not a regular menu item. But, the dish was delicious!! The fish was cooked perfectly.  My wife had Berejenas which is an eggplant dish with spinach and cheese. Both of us really enjoyed our main course items.\n\nMenu pricing is moderate, but in my opinion very fair and reasonable for what you get. Our total bill with drinks, and appetizer, two main courses (and one of them a special item), and a desert was $66 dollars.\n\nThe service was outstanding. Our waiter checked on us often, explained everything (very patiently) and was ready with recommendations. I think that most of the wait staff at the restaurant have been with them for quite a while! \n\nAnd so, even though I am dieting... we shared a dessert - Tres Leche. Let me tell you, if you don't eat anything else in Charlotte, you need to head over to Miro and try their Tres Leche! Simply the best I've had. \nThe restaurant is very clean and comfortable. I can tell you that they can accommodate a group as I have taken a group here recently. And, now that the weather is breaking, they also offer some outside seating. \n\nWhen you're looking for something different in the Stonecrest area, don't forget Miro Spanish Grille!
4 ||| This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. \n\nMy favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.\n\nMario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. \n\nPlus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons. \n\nGet the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!
4 ||| This place is wonderful and at a great location, the Chinese cultural center. They have great Asian products, great selection and great prices.\nThe products and packaging are beautiful, for the most part.\nIt is the best place to go for fresh seafood (a lot of it is still alive!), the prices are very reasonable. If you are looking for that exact something like frogs legs, rattlesnake, sea cucumber, squid flavored chips or kidney flavored tofu, this is the place to go.\nThe produce selection is great and very inexpensive.\nThe bakery counter has great pastries and other items.\nIt is a great place to just experience.
4 ||| Brian{Syvrud} was patient, available, creative, professional... truly a delight to work with! \nGreg Dunlap} did an excellent job communicating and managing the construction project beginning to end!
3 ||| Talk about a Sausage fest,  Sausages, Sausages! This places has them, hanging on the wall, everywhere.  Some kind of sausage factory in the back and the personal up front is straight to the point no chit chatting here.  I love the pastrami if I go in for a quick bite.  I like the take different kinds of sausages to go to cook later.\n\nI tried giving them three starts just could not do it this places deserves the fourth star while sausage company takes number uno.  The place just gives a great vibe of credibility that these people know their encased meats.  \n\nThe one hater, \nJohn J, your story is as bogus as it sounds, any formal news from your health department complaint?  The reviews are high star rating after another.
3 ||| Hey, it's Sonny's! The wife and I stopped in for a quick bite before catching a movie last week. The service was super fast and friendly. I ordered the pulled pork platter w/ mac n cheese, slaw and garlic bread. The mac n cheese was good, not great. Same with the slaw. The pulled pork was average. It definitely needs some sauce. I do like Sonny's' sauces, especially the Sizzling Sweet. Now, the garlic bread, to me, is still the star of the dish. Take that for what it's worth.
3 ||| Yum!  This place had my family wanting to go back the very next night. Hubby and son had gyros and loved them. We had the spicy feta fries as an appetizer and...wow!  Dishes are authentic and fresh. Our server was fantastic and brought all of us a small piece of baklava after dinner. We only wish we lived closer so we could visit Saba's more often.
4 ||| I forgot to review my birthday lunch......damn it anyways! \n\nI wanted to try some of Mr. Biancos offerings but did not want to wait 3 hours for pizza so we decided to come here.\n\nI figured it would be my only trip here in quite some time so I decided to get 2 sandwiches.  I got the tomato, basil and mozarella.  And I also got the sopresetta and provlone with roasted peppers. \n\nThe sopresetta was one of the top 5 sandwiches I have ever had.  It was absolutely perfect.  Not a whole lot of meat, but the flavor was super delicious!  The roasted red peppers and sharp provolone blended well and it was on some amazing bread.  Basically pizza crust.  SO GOOD!\n\nThe tomato sandwich was meh.  Im not the biggest fan of tomatos to begin with and when I tried I bite I knew why ;-).  I picked them out and basically ate a mozarella sandwich.  This one got a little soggy too. \n\nAbout 8 bucks each which was ok by me.  The candy they give you in the bag is a super small caramel.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.  One bite and it was dust.  If I ever come back to Phoenix I will definitley stop by and get a sopresetta sandwich.  It was amazing!
4 ||| Really good food.  Their pizza, chicken parm and spaghetti with meatballs are favorites.  There's often a wait but good things are worth waiting for.  Really large portions, usually good service, casual fun atmosphere.  Also a fan of their garlic bread.
4 ||| Have to give a shout out to this place. Although I have only gone to \"Cocktails\" a few times in the last few years, it will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nFlash back 25 years ago. My Dad used to take me here for happy hour with his work buddies. Some may say that isn't good parenting. Maybe its not. But I have very fond memories of sitting up at the bar getting my cheeks pinched by the bartender and the patrons. The nice, smoky voiced, wrinkly blond female bartender would put a zillion maraschino cherries in my shirley temple. And I would play darts with my Daddy. I feel warm and fuzzy just thinking about it.\n\nOnce I would hit adulthood I would stop in every so often. Though my life was constantly changing this bar just felt like home. \n\nAnother warm fuzzy memory? My brother proposed to his amazing wife here on New Years Eve a few years ago. I wasn't there at the time, but he text me pictures after the proposal.\n\nGreat prices, great service, great memories.
1 ||| Do NOT eat breakfast here, husband and I came for brunch paid 21.99....to expensive for the mediocre food...deserts were old, food was bland, nothing to rave about...better off eating in the Diner located in the Casino....perhaps the lunch or dinner is better??
2 ||| I've heard great things about Razzoo's, but was hesitant to try. We finally made our way to Concord, in hopes of fulfilling my oyster and crawfish cravings. Upon entering the restaurant, I am automatically drawn to the relaxed, eclectic vibe. Glass bottles, barrels and ropes are amongst a few things that marry the entire atmosphere. I was pretty excited to have some cajun food and curious if Razzoo's could hold its own against my beloved Cajun Queen in Charlotte (yes, yes I know.. that's a pretty hard act to follow!). We ordered a dozen of raw oysters,  a pound of crawfish, the Tchoupitoulas and bread pudding between 2 people. Okay, now let's break it down! \n\nRaw Oysters: Oysters were delicious but sadly, a lot smaller than I expected. It comes with cocktail and horseradish sauce. Be careful with that horseradish! I got a major brain tingle lol ..not sure how else to explain it but let's just say wasabi is typically made from horseradish.\n\nCrawfish: Very flavorful basket of crawfish complemented by a few potatoes.. and only $6.49/lb! If you like spicy foods, try the crawfish in blazin' cajun! Remember, the crawfish isn't listed on the menu, but simply request a few pounds from your server! One pound is probably enough as an appetizer, but I would recommend at least 2 as a meal. Overall, the crawfish was quite tasty. If I just ate the tail then it would have been perfect, but since I normally eat the entire crawfish it was a bit salty.\n\nTchoupitoulas: mmmm... probably my favorite part of the entire meal! A creamy drizzle over chicken breast on top a bed of potatoes, mushrooms and diced ham that was also marinated with a tasty sauce. So much flavor in every bite! A bowl of greens is also served with this dish - delightful! \n\nBread Pudding: It makes absolutely no sense why this isn't served with ice cream! Thus, we added a scoop of vanilla ice cream (for an extra $1.50). The perfect combination of warm and cold in a sweet delight. The bread pudding was crunchy on the outside and fluffy/moist on the inside, exactly how dessert should be!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience at Razzoo's. The environment and the tasty food are perfect reasons why this place draws such a crowd (along with alcohol served in giant fish bowls). Razzoo's definitely did surprise (good surprises) me as far as the quality for a franchise, but I would say Cajun Queen still holds my heart in Cajun/Creole cuisine. Nonetheless I enjoyed my dinner at Razzoo's and would give 3.5 if I could.
0 ||| All restaurants/bars close before 10pm?  This airport is bad. I must have walked over a mile to find everything closed.  No food, no beer, no anything after 9:45pm.  Even if things were open, there are very few choices for decent food. If you are travelling later in the day and plan to eat, drink, or just relax and watch sports, I would pay more for a layover in pretty much any city other than Phoenix.
3 ||| Went last night to watch the game with some friends.  Showed up at 8:30 and there was a decent enough crowd.  Sat at a long, high top table on the restaurant side.  Waitress showed up quickly and was attentive throughout our visit.  \n\nWe ordered a sampler platter of food which was basic bar food.....boneless wings with hot BBQ sauce were decent.  Friend cheese triangles were pretty gross, pretzel sticks were eatable. Nothing fancy, but I didn't expect it to be and it met my expectations.\n\nI'd go back to watch a game.  I'd probably order something different off the menu though.
3 ||| Shogun Chicken\nSunset roll\nTuna sashimi\nGodzilla tails\nYaki Niku\nSaki bombers\n\nJust a few of the reasons we keep returning to Shogun after all these years.  \nI have had them cater parties on several occasions...\n3 stars because sometimes the rolls are loose and service can be uneven.\nJust sit in the bar... they take care of you there!
0 ||| I don't if there is way to give 0 start to this particular macarono grill location, before ordering Mushroom Ravioli, I asked waitress if this is totally vegetarian, she said yes. When she served, there was a big peice of chicken on top of it, i asked her what is it ? she say's it's just a big piece of rvaioli, i looked carefully with a fork, and it was chichken, she took it back, and brought a fresh one, and it tasted horrible.\n\nI saw manager roaming around here and there, but he looked totally useless, no one came to apologize to us....\n\nWaitress asked if we wanted more bread, we said yes, and that bread never came.....\n\nI WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THIS MACARONI GRILL LOCATION, TOTAL RIP OFF
4 ||| I love this place.  I've been going since I was a kid (I moved away but I'm back now) and I thought maybe my travels and eating \"good food\" would change my opinion of this place...nope!\n\nTheir salsa is so good, their food is wonderful.  I love their beef machaca and their fajitas are ridiculous.  \n\nIf you want good, legit mexian food come here.  \n\nThis place also has the best high chairs for kids (random thing I know).  I love places that actually invest in good things for family dining...
3 ||| The food is a step-up from normal bar food. With that said, it is still bar food. None of the beers have impressed. The atmosphere is decent enough, the service is often lacking. And for what you are getting, the prices are a tad high.
4 ||| Best spot in Peoria for quality craft beer with countless choices to choose from!! Over 30 beers on draft and over 50 different bottles, they do happy hour specials that are unbeatable in this area! Chicago style deep dish pizza to calzones, pepperoni rolls to Italian nachos.. they have all realms of \"italian bar food\" as well as salads and sandwhiches for the \"non-traditionals\"\n\nService is great and all the waiters and waitresses are amazing. Specials are consistent, ESPECIALLY around football season!\n\nFor what it is, best I'd say in this area!
4 ||| Went through the drive thru to get some coffee and water today. It was a rather long wait, but when we finally got to the window they gave us our drinks for FREE! Such a nice and pleasant surprise. Thanks Starbucks!
4 ||| Had dinner at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Colleen the bartender advised me on the meal and Mike the bartender talked soccer and hoops.  First they served me home baked bread with a delicious spread that was a meal by itself, then I had the poached pear gorgonzola salad which was light, tasty and satisfying.  Then Colleen advised the wild Boar.  What a treat!! delicious and came with a risotto that was amazing.  Topped off with a wild blueberry sauce.  Portion was huge and I could not finish it but I wish I could have.  I ended with the molten chocoloate cake with vanilla ice cream.  15 minutes to prepare Colleen had warned me, but 3 minutes to eat.  Super meal, wont forget it.  If you have a face and a mouth and can chew food, you will surely love Blue!!
3 ||| Although I was very tempted to give this place 4-stars, I had to settle on 3.  The atmosphere is great, an ideal place for a casual meeting, or just getting some work done.  It's cozy and interesting inside, the staff is nice.  However, on my last visit, the cappuccino I ordered was wayyy too foamy and didn't really taste much like a cappuccino, or much like anything.  This may be due to the skills of that particular barista, but next time I stop in, I'll probably just save my money and order a drip coffee.  However, still a great place to hang out.
4 ||| The service was great. (Alice) our waitress was really helpful and gave us what we needed. The food was good. Buffalo meatloaf was tasty, chicken was good. Vegetables were a little garlicky.
0 ||| I've only been here for brunch once....it's the shit. \n\nThey had me with the \"ATTENTION BALLERS, no $50 or $100 BILLS, PLEASE\" \n(I'll post a picture)\n\nBasically my kind of place already. \n\nIt's a tiny place inside thus the 4 stars but they have a nice patio area with benches, tables and ect. \n\nFood is like some concoction of amazingness. I can't even remember what I had, but it was tasty and full of god knows what, pretty much everything and anything one can think of. They also sell beers and stuff. \n\nIt's located in the garfield district right off roosevelt. \n\nI heard it was once a food truck that parked and now it rests. \n\nGo here for something awesome and different.
3 ||| Definitely didn't live up to the expectations.  Being from the east coast I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches.  Stopped in for lunch and had the capicola sandwich.  Outside of the bread I can't say it was memorable in any way.\n\nThat said I could see this as a post night out stop and would probably enjoy it a lot more.
3 ||| I found myself in a worrisome situation and in a jiffy, all was back in order. \n\nI am out of town on a road trip and while driving to dinner last night a warning light came on.  I checked my owners manual (can you believe it was actually in the car) and it said to check my oil level.\n\nAfter considering my options, I decided to give Jiffy Lube a call.  Surely they can just add a quart so I don't have to find a Pep Boys?\n\nAfter reading the reviews on Yelp I was concerned that I would get the run around.  I think Jiffy Lube is like any multi-location business.  Some are good and some are not so good.  It all depends on the store manager.  I happened to luck out I think.  The manager at this location is named Joe and he told me to just come in and they would help out.  Initially he referred me to a closer location, but when I called them I got the standard - \"We only will change your oil, we do not just do quarts\".  So I called Joe back and he said come on in.\n\nWell, exactly as I thought, I needed a few quarts to get me back on the road.  Joe said he would just top it off for me for FREE since they will do that for customers (I never knew).  I thanked him and handed him $5 bucks anyway as this really put my mind at ease.\n\nI am back in Road Warrior shape and somewhat relieved.\n\nThanks Joe !!
4 ||| As my wife says, \"They are always a 5 star visit\". We tried the white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta and bacon and I have to say it was AMAZING!! So much so that my wife had 3 pieces! The kids enjoyed the spaghetti and pizza slice from the kids menu as well. Will visit again when in town next year for sure!!
4 ||| The service is outstanding. Portions are large, and meals are relatively cheap. Always yummy!
1 ||| I love del taco but why is this one different?The people are courteous but it doesn't make up for the food.Every time I go I have to wait about 5 mins in front after I go through the drive thru line.Every time I get a quesadilla it is old and cold and is more like a cheese crisp.Oh well I could take it home and give it to my dog as a rubber toy....at least it smells like cheese so for that I give it at least a star.
3 ||| It did take a while to get our drinks here, but they were super apologetic. It wasn't a big deal as we realized there was someone new that was also training so it took a little longer to get all the drinks ready. Not a big deal.\n\nDrinks were tasty and I had happy kids.
2 ||| Location is a little run down, but it's Shoneys. You kind of get what you pay for. \n\nFood is still decent, but not best quality. \n\nOne positive is you have a big variety!
4 ||| On a weekday afternoon, I thought I might pop up here and refresh my skills at making holes in paper and high velocity rather than driving over to the range in Matthews. Since most folks were busy at their daily grind, there was no waiting.\n\nIt's small and it's loud but it's good enough. If you've never been here before, they have a three minute safety video that you have to watch. Once that's done, you're good to go!\n\nI bring my own targets, my own ammunition, my own gun, my own ear/eye protection. So really, the only think I'm paying for here is the range time.\n\nAfter my noise making was done, I wandered over to the other side of the shop and reviewed the hardware they had on sale. No great bargains, but no big markups either. A handgun I've been watching at another shop for $529 was $519 here. More or less, the same price.\n\nThis is a neat little range. If you're looking to shoot, this is a great place to go!
2 ||| Clientele is shady. It's a really, really weird mix of people...good people watching, but don't look too long!\n\nI guess I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's consistent with this part of town. All I could think when I walked in was, \"Huh?\" \n\nThe bartenders are friendly. The drinks are cheap. I'm not sure if they serve food. Even if they did, I'm not sure what it would be or if I would try it. \n\nIt's a little crazy when you walk in. Use you're imagination friends.... It looks like it used to be a strip club and there are volleyball courts outside. I really don't get it. I'm sitting here writing this right now!...and I don't get it. One part pool hall...one part casino...one part strip club= worst shot you've ever had. Expect a hangover!\n\nBut, hey, why not give it a shot?!
0 ||| it only has a few rides. the park is old and needs to be redone. there are no rides for kids which is a big issue for me. the bathrooms are so disgusting its pathetic. to much chaos. nay as well take the time to go somewhere better. i think its over priced for the little that they do have. it should only cost five dollars for locals.
3 ||| Newly relocated to Pittsburgh's east end from Miami, I wasn't sure where to turn for my hair.   I was nervous about finding talent, especially since my last few hair appointments in a new city had been less than stellar experiences. I was worried I would never find another stylist on par with the super star I had in Miami.  I couldn't let worry prolong the inevitable, however, with grey starting to peek out and ends beginning to split,  so  I did what anyone would do by asking around, reading reviews online and praying.   Upon leaving MCN Salon with my hair cut and colored to perfection, I can tell you my prayers were answered.  After reading other positive reviews about Sarah here on Yelp, I decided to book with her.   Although, I have a long, classic hair, I watched her work on a variety of other clients while my color was processing.   Her vision and talent seemed limitless as I watched her style a young child to a very punk rock female and an older more traditional man. It was very cool to watch her use her talent to shape each individual's cut to their preferred style and preference, which is what we all hope for in the chair but don't always get.   And, she does all of this for a phenomenal price.    I had full color, hair cut and blow out for $130 and was blown away.  I don't remember the last time I left a salon with the complete package for less than $200.\n\nFrom the check-in to consultation to payment and yes, rebooking I had an exceptional experience.  If you are looking for a salon and stylist in Pittsburgh, look no further than MCN Salon and Sarah!
0 ||| Just called the nurse's station phone lime provided on the web site to ask a few questions. Probably the rudest woman in Nevada to answer the phone. Could not believe what I was hearing. Called Thursday around 10:20 AM - January 1, 2015
0 ||| Went for a 40th birthday party. Service was good. Waitstaff worked hard to keep up with drink orders. It was a pretty big party & some major cash was spent. Picked up my tab at end of night & very reasonable DESPITE that they added a 20% gratuity onto everyone's bills. Wonder how many drunk people accidentally tipped 40% that night?! Now here comes the one-star... a party attendee had her handbag stolen from the bar. It happens. But guess what! Half the contents turned up behind the bar (where only staff could have accessed). Cops called - big to-do. Manager was less than helpful- without talking to staff said it absolutely couldnt be one of them. Miraculously - remaining contents turned up the next day - including jewelry & cash. What an honest thief! Reeks of inside job. STAY AWAY!!!
0 ||| It's a rip-off for a simple passport photo. It's 12 bucks-- way too expensive for such a low quality passport photo!
3 ||| I have been biking in Az and have probably tried every bike shop in the Tempe area.\nThe people Tempe Landis have always been very cordial to me.\nThey have always been willing to just \"shoot the breaze\" with me even on the numerous times I have just gone in to look around.\nTheir work has always been great and inthe event they might not stock something I needed were always able to order it in short times.\nBEST BIKE SHOP IN ARIZONA.
2 ||| I got recruited out of this mall for the Army back in 2005. They have since moved the recruiter station down the street, because it was \"unsafe\" to be in this mall. That should tell you something about coming here.
4 ||| I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together.  Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. The staff are amazing! Very nice and very helpful. The prices are very reasonable, lower than any other gym I have climbed in (and I have climbed in lots of facilities). I definitely recommend climbing here.
0 ||| My friend and I came here and when we walked in,the male waiter appeared pretty nice and told us to choose a table and sit down. He followed us to our table and handed us the menu, so we thought so far so good. Then 5,10 and 15 minutes went by and we were left alone,it appeared both the waiter and entire place forgot that we were there...they totally IGNORED us. I saw the male waiter that had helped us earlier glanced over our table a few times,but NO SERVICE what so ever. The service here was TERRIBLE, most of the employees were pretty RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL towards us. The funny thing was that the table of 5 koreans that came in way after us had their orders taken down way before us. I will NEVER,EVER come back to this hate-ful and ill-mannered restaurant ever again. Not only was the service HORRIBLE,but the atmosphere and korean waiters were too RUDE and ill-mannered,they didn't deserve our business. So we went to the Hong Kong restaurant right near it,and the Chinese waitress there were 100x nicer and better educated than those korean waiters.
0 ||| Disgusting dispatch service and drivers that LOVE to sexually harrass women and take them on terror rides not letting them out of the cab. Twice already they've been reported Taxi Authority. Since drivers went on strike they're hiring psychos and allowing Vegas locals to be long-hauled and disrespected. Worse service by far. I am a local in Vegas so heed this warning. For 4 years this cab company has been ruining our tourism by displaying Neanderthal business practices and hiring sexual offenders and criminals. Nice job Ace. Tourists and locals seek anyone.but this.company and their sister cab companies. Deposits for drivers dont exist. Taking the expressway NOT the only way to get to a location. Take their cab number name and time they we were working. Call their employment and the Taxi Authority. Its that easy to report a negative experince.
3 ||| My boyfriend and I go here just about every weekend. Great breakfast every time! We have never had bad service or bad food. We've tried several different different breakfast items...all good. Everyone there is super friendly. Be prepared for a wait for a table at peak times on the weekends...and your food may be slow to come during busy times...but it is worth it!
4 ||| Dr.Carr is a favorite!!! I recommend him to everyone! He has taken excellent care of me. I have a completely irrational fear of dentist. I use to cry at every visit when I was young and no more tears since I've been here! Beverly remembers everything for me and they even call to make sure I'm ok the day after a big procedure! I just love my dentist and my beautiful white teeth!!
0 ||| They FORCE YOU TO PAY 15% TIPS now automatic on bill \nWARNING: DO NOT GO to this place extremely ((((SUCKS)))))  DO NOT GO \n1) OVER PRICED ! talking about avg $15-$19 a dish in LA only $6-$10\n2) FOUND COCKROACHES swimming in soup s-h-i-t huh ????\n3)all waiters BAD ATTITUDE , not just 1 but all waiters so mean!! \n4)they automatic put 15% TIPS ON CHECK at the end, (I only have party of 3)\n5) Cash only so they can get away AVOID PAY TAX TO IRS but they charged us collected tax from us on check. TAX FRAUD business\n\nWARNING: DO NOT GO to this place extremely ((((SUCKS)))))  DO NOT GO
3 ||| Original Pancake House's pancakes are great!  The best I've ever had?  No, but among the best.\n\nServers are consistently friendly and efficient, and the dining area is always clean.  Portions are generous, and prices are fair.
4 ||| Hipster Hideaway! \n\nWhen Casey Moores is too packed, this is the best second resort. It's tucked away in this shopping center with a specialty shoe store and a pet store.\n\nI usually stop by on Sundays when there's FREE pool, but the regulars can be a little 'table stingy' so you may have to ask nicely. The drinks are pretty cheap and vibe is pretty chill. They have always been super crazy about carding at the door, I guess this is a Tempe thing, but coming here for months every Sunday, do you really have to ask twice?\n\nAside from that, it's nice to grab a booth and listen to the great juke box! Usually the music isn't very loud, so you can have a conversation without yelling into someones ear. Bring your friends and buy a pitcher!
0 ||| I used to do all my grocery shopping at Trader Joe's, but this location is just awful.  They are always very poorly stocked and I get BS excuses for why they are out of things.  I was told that I needed to come \"earlier in the day\" to buy salads.  In addition to that just not working with my schedule, it's unheard of.  I will not be shopping here until the ordering starts to improve.
4 ||| Dr Tang always seems to be in a wicked rush. She always talking very fast and really doesn't seem to care about anything but EXACTLY what she thinks I'm here for. \n \n The fact that there are issues that are related  and cause each other doesn't matter to her. The office staff are abrupt, always seems as if there is something fun going on that they could be doing if only the darn patients would go away.  \nHer attempt to tell my options for pain care literally consisted of her telling drugs or, and here she points at a poster. I asked several questions, but she just kept pointing at the spine implant stimulater poster. No words, just pointing. I did finally squeeze it out of her that my ins would pay for the trial, but not the implant.  (?)\n On the plus side there is no wait,  and plenty of parking. And a Sonic next door.\n If it's not different by January I'll start looking for a new one, the only reason I haven't  is it's such a pain.\n\nI do have to add that the procedures, facets, etc. are much nicer here than other places I've been. Lorraine, who schedules them is very caring, and sweet, really makes sure it's all done as comfortable as possible!
2 ||| The cost/benefit ratio is very good at Hooters  @ $47/night (including the $16 resort fee, depending when you book)!  The hotel is centrally located, across the MGM Grand Hotel.  Hooters is definitely showing its age though.  The carpeting, wall fixtures, rooms, and general appearance is showing significant wear and tear.  the hotel is in need of a facelift.  The rooms are clean but showing that 90's look--including  tube TV.  That being said, Hooters is probably the best value hotel you will find adjacent to the strip (Technically it's 1-blk off the strip on Tropicana).  The hotel offers nice pools with a full service bar, a sandy beach area,hot tub, scantly clad Hooters Girls, and party music.   Gambling is cheaper too with $3 black jack.  Located inside Hooters, is the Mad Onion restaurant.  Mad Onion serves a very good prime rib dinner, cooked to order prime rib, with a baked potato, steamed vegetables, and roll w/ butter for $9.95.  We ate there three nights and really liked it.  Hooters is a 3-star hotel,  presenting 4-star value.  Hooters is a Vegas frat house oriented party hotel.  If you've come to Vegas to party, eat, drink on the cheap, to enjoy the strip and just need your room to serve as \"home base\" to recharge, than Hooters is your place.  If you want the luxurious Vegas hotel room experience, stay elsewhere and pay a lot more.
3 ||| Popular neighborhood chinese food joint with ample buffet. Started with take-out, then a follow up with a friend for dine in. My take out was fine--vegetables were done to perfection, chicken was recognizable as chicken, not some dressed up faux meat. Fairly generous with sauce--I like my food a little less with sauce, but thats me.\n\nDine in was hit or miss; this could have been an off day. Some of the food was cold, all of it was very sauced.  Good variety of beef, chicken, seafood; not everything fried, which was nice. Some comfort food, green beans, etc., that I didn't try out, but it was good to know that they understand it can be hard to please everyone in a dining party.\n\nNot my favorite, but reliable.
4 ||| Me and a friend stopped in here one night maybe 10 or 15 minutes before they closed. We had been in the mood for some good BBQ, but have no idea where the good BBQ places in Phoenix are at, so we thought we would just give it a try since we were starved. \n\nThis was the first BBQ I had since I moved to AZ, and remains the last place I've had BBQ at (I've been pinching my pennies lately, and BBQ is generally pretty pricey!)\n\nAll in all, I'd say this place was pretty good. I contemplated a pulled pork sandwich, though I've heard nasty stories about people who've consumed undercooked pork, so I decided to feel the place out with beef first. It was terrific, and I wish I would have went with the pork! came with fries too and they were excellent. \n\nI didn't know what to expect coming in so close to closing time, but I was very happy I stopped in. I do look forward to stopping by again when I'm in the area.\n\nSince I havent tried any other bbq in Phoenix, I really can't compare honey bears to anything else. But overall, I was pretty satisfied.
2 ||| Friendly service. However, I have brought several watches in for battery replacements and the batteries consistently need to be replaced  within 6 months. I do not come here anymore
2 ||| The Greek fries are good. Ripe salad was ok. Veg wrap was a oversized tortilla with bigmac sauce and a 1/4 cup of veggies. Gyro pita was dry so tried to cover up with taziki sauce but it wasn't that good and kind of thick.
2 ||| The people here are not the nicest of people....seems like they just wanted to get through the day
2 ||| I had a donut on its last leg and a nail in another tire very little money, but they hooked me up and now I'm on my way, HAPPY! :-)
3 ||| After my Radio Milano experience, my friends and I decided to get a wine nightcap at Postino.\n\nI was already tired, but still wanted to hang out.  This was my 2nd time at Postino (first time was for drinks and dinner)  We just wanted wine this time...we ordered 2 bottles.  (I sound like a lush)  The bar closed at 11pm, which I thought was odd...on a Saturday night I thought it should be later.  But the server said that enjoy all we want and we can order all we want until then.  They will so not kick us out.\n\nI just love the atmosphere of this place.  I don't feel that I am in a pretentious crowd and the service is so on its mark.  There is a chance that I will be there for New Years...and if so...update!!!!
4 ||| Great food, nice people and mediocre service. I enjoy this place often!
3 ||| Creative pizza options, but I found the service to be a bit on the slow side. I popped in for a take out. While I watched the kitchen from my table, I saw my slices come out of the oven and go into the box. Where they sat for a solid five minutes (I wanted to see how long it would take) before the right person noticed and brought them over to me.\n\nHawaiian had a good portion of pineapple and ham. Veggie on whole wheat was loaded with peppers and mushrooms and more. They warmed up fine when I got them home. Very yummy.
3 ||| My boyfriend and I just moved here, and live down the road from Wing King Cafe. We were hungry and wanted something easy so after looking on yelp and saving this place as somewhere to try we decided to go for some wings. The wings are VERY good. I go the hot ranch and my boyfriend got the hot and tangy honey mustard. We both thought our orders were very tasty and will be going there again. We called and ordered for carry out since we just live down the road. The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because 1 the cook their food in the same oil as fish, and if you have allergies that can be scary (which my boyfriend does have a mild allergy with shellfish) and 2 the staff wasn't exactly the most friendly. But I wasn't expecting to handed my food on a golden platter since its definitely a dive bar, but with good food. We will be going back.
2 ||| For reasons that surprise and depress me, Madison's Far West Side restaurant scene consists almost entirely of corporate/chain operations. For funkier and more imaginative options, one has to look elsewhere (although locally operated--and pricey-- Eno Vino is in the same strip mall as Biaggi's).  But among the chain operations, Biaggi's is one of the best--a lively, generally bustling operation with a variety of reasonably good Italian-style menu options, Not the most imaginative, not the most intimate, but a generally well run and satisfying mildly upscale place for a nice meal with friends. In some ways, this is the Italian parallel to P.F. Chang's (see my review).\n\nBiaggi's has sustained some menu setbacks in recent months, with several of our more distinctive favorites disappearing from its menu offerings. Last night we discovered that its regionally unique espresso lamb porterhouse was gone. An early favorite, a pasta dish with smoked salmon and a vodka cream sauce, was an earlier casualty. The best of their bread offerings disappeared a few months back. I've spoken with the manager--a friendly and accommodating fellow--and these decisions seem to be made at the corporate level, with little flexibility for local tastes. That is too bad--a further homogenizing of menu options, with fewer distinctive items appealing to other than common denominator tastes.\n\nAll that said, Biaggi's remains a tasty and pleasant option for a reasonably priced neighborhood meal. Reservations are recommended on busy nights (one can usually call ahead half an hour or an hour before desired meal time and avoid the worst of the lines). Bring earplugs and/or hearing aids--things have gotten quite noisy on busy nights.
4 ||| I thought I would try out this location after my previous auto shop had closed and hoped, being that AAA recommended it, it would provide good honest service.  \n\nHad an oil change/maintenance check done there and was please with the service.  But when I returned to have it looked at after the engine light went on, their \"diagnostics\" test was going to cost $105!  And that wouldn't have been waived if I had the service completed there!  I had to pass....free diagnostics test are available everywhere, don't be suckered!
2 ||| I have been to The Palm in L.A., and had an amazing dinner experience there.  I decided to go there for Thanksgiving dinner this year, as there were only two of us, and it's not worth the mess to cook for two.\nThis wasn't my first choice, but Sullivan's was not available.\nThe Palm had a Thanksgiving menu, or the regular menu was available.\nBoth of us went Thanksgiving.\nThe first course was great:  I had the arugula & apple salad, and my girlfriend had the lobster bisque.  Both were excellent.\nSecond course was the main entree:  sliced turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy, plus our choice of veggie.  We had whipped potatoes and green beans.\nEverything was very good.\nThe last course was dessert, which we got to go.  The choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie.  We both chose the pecan pie.\nAt home later that evening, we learned that this dessert was nothing more than store-bought pumpkin pie with chocolate chips pressed into the top.  The crust was awful, and had the tell-tale pattern of a machine-made pastry.\nReally?!\nI am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef.  I left The Palm in L.A. with a piece of carrot cake that was worth fighting over (or at least arm wrestling).  \nYou are not getting out of The Palm for less than $75 per person.  I was shocked that was the best they could do. \nAdded frustration:  Thanksgiving is the day that everyone from age 80-120 has dinner at The Palm.  It is impossible get from A to B outside or inside the place.  \nWe'll go elsewhere in the future.
3 ||| So this Starbucks is a really nice one as far as comfort goes. It's big, a lot of seats a nice fireplace and the bathrooms have been pretty clean each time I've been there. My problem here is that they don't brew a blonde roast. You have to get a pour over if you want it. Normally that would be fine, but at this location they can not seem to remember they started one. On 3 different occasions I have watched my coffee sit there getting cold. After almost 10 min one time I got an apology... But normally it's about 5 min after it's been done that you get it (after asking). No apology... Just here. It's kinda sad. It would have gotten a 5 star, but they forget you. It would have been 4 star... But no apology.
3 ||| While driving around the Phoenix area, my group and I got a craving for Japanese. Yelp pointed us in the direction of this restaurant, much to our delight. I could definitely see what people meant about it being hot in summer, as it was a tad warm when we visited in March! (About 80 degrees) The decor is very simple, if a tiny bit dated. It felt like walking into my grandma's house, with its bamboo mat covered walls and rice paper wall furnishings. That's probably the best way to describe the overall experience: homey. \n\nThe menu was not fancy by any means, but had a large assortment of rice dishes, and one could either order the entree by itself, or, for a few sheckles more, turn it into a combination plate with white rice, miso soup, a salad, a piece of gyoza, and a chicken skewer. They also had noodle dishes (hot and cold, though cold is only served in the summer), and a few, select styles of really simple sushi (not Westernized!) like shrimp tempura and tuna. They do have a note that in the summer months, they do not make sushi for carry out (taking the Arizona heat into consideration) so that it won't spoil.\n\nMy whole group ordered from the entree+rice menu and all got the combos. We also ordered hot tea (excellent), honey lemonade (refreshing), and a Coke (syrup and carbonated water seemed slightly out of balance). \n\nI had unagi-don (eel), my brother ordered katsu-don (chicken fried in egg) and my friend had teriyaki beef. All were cooked well and were tasty. I think the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the salad, which was very vinegary and had onions (blech).\n\nThe only server there was, I assume, the owner, who other people have mentioned. He was rather quiet, but I just wanted to give him a hug. I wasn't raised on Japanese food, but I definitely wish I had a place like this in Vegas to add to my list of comfort food spots.
4 ||| Yea there are better hotels in Madison but the Inntowner is a good hotel if you have business on this side of town. \nThe free airport shuttle and being able to walk to my client site is a big plus. Also having the Blue Moon and Lombardino's restaurants next door is a good thing!\nTheir regular rooms are average at best and their Highland Club rooms are on par with say the Marriott concierge level. Their workout room is OK, it could use an update, but it is suitable for working off those Brats and Curds.\nThe bar staff and front desk are very accommodating and have been very helpful during my past two visits.
4 ||| Best Croque Monsieur I've had in a long time. Just excellent. Server was very professional. Setting was amazing. Can't wait to return.
0 ||| Descriptive phrase: worthless.\n\nNo. Just, no. I lived in Madison for 4 years and never came to this place nor ever heard of a single person who had. Now I know why.\n\nLocation: hidden off the main drag. Bouncer: really, for this place? Bartender: nice. Drinks: not as cheap as other places and much weaker. Patrons: townies and/or creepy as all get-out.\n\nThe decor was the only saving grace of this dive. They really went all out on trying to decorate the inside with tiki-themed posters and idols and the like. But it just couldn't overcome the other issues.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the entire place reeked. Like, seriously smelled like a toilet. \n\nWe couldn't believe how bad it was. We literally made a promise never to return.
4 ||| They have one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had.  I was blocked in traffic due to the president taking off at the airport, so when I ordered my food to pick up, they literally brought it out to my car for me.  They are the nicest people.
4 ||| I love Bud's. For years they worked on my old '60 Galaxie when most other shops in town either didn't want to or didn't know how to do the work. These guys are real mechanics, not just a collection of 20 yr olds who only know how to plug your car into a computer to diagnose the problem. And most importantly, they don't run up the bill for extra time or unnecessary parts. My buddy just received a quote for a job of $175 from bud's that another shop wanted to charge $800 for! \n\nBottom line: to me, auto shops are all about finding someone fair you can trust. For me, it's these guys.
0 ||| While the food here is good, there are a number of reasons why I can't recommend it to my friends.\n\nThe inside is cramped and aged and while I have no problems with hole in the wall style restaurants, this is not an excuse to have an unclean interior which looks like it hasn't been cared for in many years.  In addition to this the owners of this franchise look to nickel and dime you in every conceivable way including charging for tap water, charging for soda refills, and charging you $3 if you want to use a debit card.  Not only this, but if you want to get your sandwich to go they'll charge you extra for fries, which are normally included as a side if you eat in.  A typical sandwich will run you about $8 with no drink.\n\nOne time while I stood in line waiting for a sandwich, the man who appeared to be the owner started complaining to his employees that whoever cut the portobello mushrooms that day had made them too thick, which was \"costing him money.\"\n\nNothing puts a bad taste in your mouth like getting ripped off.
1 ||| I've been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  I'm a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said \"WTF???\"  Worst RB EVER!\n\nWhat the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the \"fine print\" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is \"natural\" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).\n\nAfter the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of \"is she ever coming back???\").  I'd say, go here for the beer, sans root, but that's about it.  Otherwise, skip this place and drive out to Four Peaks...you'll be happier all around.
2 ||| We have enjoyed our previous visits to this Red Robin, but the last 2 trips have revealed inattentive servers.  Last night our food arrived via a manager, but we had no silverware or napkins.  As our server Brittany was no where to be found, we began our meal with fingers.  Finished our meal, dirty plates stacked on our table, along with empty drink glasses.  Britney walked by about 13 times, never once stopping to pick up dirty dishes or ask us if we needed anything.  We were never offered refills on drinks, fries, root beer floats.  Waited another 14 minutes for a check, again can't find Britney. We got up from our booth to start walking out of the restaurant, and Britney suddenly appeared with our check.   Not sure where the servers go to hide, but it must be a great place to hang out while your customers wait patiently for your return.
0 ||| Horrible. This place is terribly unprofessional. They billed me multiple times after a scan I had done, for a payment I submitted months ago. I had written them a check: They cashed it, kept my money, and then proceeded to continue billing me for it! I even sent them a \"proof of payment\" from my bank, proving they cashed it, and still they kept billing. I called them multiple times over several months about this issue, to no avail. And the best part? No one ever even apologized or followed up with me. They really could care less. Stay away!!
4 ||| We've been here over a couple dozen times and love it - primarily for the great happy hour deals.  The margaritas are super tasty and strong. The Mexican pizza is huge as are the nachos. Both are way too big for one person.  Try the sliders - again a generous portion.  You won't be disappointed.  When not eating off the happy hour menu, we usually eat the chorizo or machaca huevos. Muy bien!
2 ||| After doing the movies and the mall I had to stop and get a script which was right next door to this place so I asked my bf if he wanted to try them out. \n\nWe came in and it seemed like a cool place, clean and well lit etc. I personally thought the girl that took our info was super bitchy and rude but aside that he said it was ok (which is what the 3 stars is for, had it been me...1 star for sure, I mean this chick asks us for my bf's name 3x so she can enter it into the system (after we tell her we've never been there AND  asked their prices)  before she will even tell us a price?! Wtf! So yeah, nothing to write home about. He also noted they are NOT a barber shop....they can't shape or line him up the way he wanted so yeah...keep your hot towel and shitty service and I will keep my money.\n\nUpdate: 7/27/2010 - Star rating is now at a 1 (was at a 3).\n\nSo he decided to go back (it was close and he didn't want to wait to go to his regular place) and again, horrible service - this time we waited 35min before they called the guy who came in 20min after us and then we are sitting there while the \"ladies\" that work their figure out who's name they got wrong....finally he gets his cut ane he said he does NOT like that place and is never going back - period.
3 ||| When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect.
3 ||| 2/1/2013: Sesame Inn still getting an A Grade from Maricopa County Environmental Services. :-)\n\nMy family has spent thousands of dollars here since 1999.  Mostly because the staff will always do special orders with an \"oh, sure!\" sort of joy.  And it's the only decent Chinese in the Desert Foothills (Shanghai Club in Anthem ain't bad).\n\nThere are two Chinese menu items I sort of use as a test:  Spicy Eggplant and Hot & Sour Soup.  Either are often quite obviously *wrong* in other restaurants but not here.\n\nSpicy Eggplant is EXACTLY how one would hope and dream this dish should be -- the eggplant is creamy / cooked to perfection and the yummy sauce displays green onion and garlic equally to the palate.  And it's always served really good and hot.\n\nHot & Sour Soup also has a number of distinguishable flavors floating around in it.  (As opposed to the too-thick salty goop many places pass off as Hot & Sour.)  The sour (vinegar) is always perfect.  I always order it without pork but no one else at the table seems to care because the deliciousness is nevertheless quite potent!  Oh, and this soup is chock full of all kinds of exotic vegetables.\n\nThis place is a bit pricey but there is a certain pride of workmanship going on here.
2 ||| So I pull up in my Ford Taurus, get valet parking, and watch them park it in-between a next years model Ferrari and a Bentley. Entertaining to me. :)  We walk through a very charming little place to T. Cook's and enjoyed a nice meal.  Service and the atmosphere were great.  The food however was just ok.  For the price, the food was not at all worth it. However, being what T. Cook's is, I would have to say that it's a great place for a special occasion or a date for the average Joe. Very impressive dinning experience, I just wish the food would have been better.  Atmosphere - A+ Food - C-
2 ||| I have such a different perspective on this place.  I used to babysit for one of the dancers.  She was quite nice.  And apparently very flexible.  And sometimes when she would pay in cash, it would be interesting to think about where that money had come from - both the person, and potentially where on her body.  Luckily I had less concept of this as a teenage babysitter than I do now.  But I will say - she totally fit the After-School special version of a dancer.  Super nice.  Great mom.  And yes, she was putting herself through medical school.  Some kind of nursing specialty.  I thought I knew all I needed to know about this place from seeing how she'd come by after work.  All that make up and that funny smell.  Eau de cheesy strip club.  How innocent I was...\n\nSomehow watching them cavort out there, it's hard for me to picture these folks working hard to put themselves though school.  Though I hold on hard to that image.  I've only been once and that was pretty much enough.  The guys I used to work with loved this place.  They felt like it was one of the few places where they might actually have a chance with some of these girls, and that made the whole process much more exciting.  \n\nIf there is such thing as your \"neighborhood\" strip club, than this is it.  Just like a neighborhood bar, it's not the prettiest one in town, it may not have all the bells and whistles, but you can get comfortable there, and you just might become a regular.  \n\nHistorical note - When I was a kid this was ALL by itself out here.  Nothing else was out here.  You knew you had reached the far, far edge of town when you finally hit the Candy Store.  And now?  It's right down the street from a High School.  It keeps going on for miles and miles.  Sprawl and the strip club...
2 ||| Made a special trip to this place based on glowing Yelp reviews and was really disappointed.  The burger was not great--reminded me of overcooked backyard BBQ.  The onion rings were okay.  Nothing good enough to make me return.
3 ||| Nothing beats Desert Jade.  They've updated their dining room and accommodate my now vegan diet.
4 ||| just a okay place for Americanized Chinese food(you know, general tsao's chicken, beef broccoli, sweet sour pork and such). decent amount, but mostly on the bland side. Sometimes i just wish they could put something (M.S.G, chicken stock, oyster sauce or whatever works) into their cooking to make the dishes more flavorful! really, but mostly it just taste like soy sauce. *sign* but the people work their are nice. :) they wont greet you overwhelmingly(big smile, \"hi\", \"how are you\" and stuff), just generally being nice.  ps. try their dumplings, there are huge! i like them~
3 ||| When we arrived in Phoenix, we took the shuttle to the rental car facility which was really close. There was no line when we arrived and we were helped right away. \n\nWe decided to upgrade our sedan to a luxury car and chose the BMW 3 Series for our trip. We were going to be traveling to a couple different cities, so we decided that comfort was worth the extra bucks and we got this baby to go. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtLM-iRYp3UGOEz4_b0I2Q?select=yxtZReRgIeRPWgyUPhDEww#yxtZReRgIeRPWgyUPhDEww\n\nWe did not choose to pre-pay for gas, it really wasn't that big of a deal since our car got great mileage. We did not choose the extra insurance, since my guy's insurance covers other cars in other states. You have to know which options to choose or you can get ripped off. \n\nI loved the car personally. It may have been a little more than we orginally expected to pay, but it was fun and very comfortable while we enjoyed our time in Phoenix.
0 ||| Sorry folks, I'm not a fan.  When out with my family we decided to get something frozen for a treat.  The one good thing about this place is that it serves Dave & Andy's ice cream.  But that is possibly the only good thing about the place.\n\nThere is no order in here.  Especially with three possible ways to enter.  The proper entrance at the front of the building, the side entrance or if and when the doors are open, walk right through the front of the store.  With that, no one seems to know where the line starts, if there is a line at all for service.  What should take just a few minutes to order your item easily turns into a good ten to fifteen minute wait staring down the person that just cut in front of you and several other people.\n\nThe pricing seems a bit high here too.  For two scopes of ice cream the cost was equivalent to going to a frozen yogurt place and getting a cup filled with not only frozen goodness, but mixture items as well.\n\nThe place is nicely set up, but it does feel a bit crowded in here.
0 ||| The GOOD: Service. The BAD & the UGLY... If I was in another country, okay... BUT, amazingly dirty!!!! You could \"nate on the floor here and it would go unnoticed. Menus,tables, condiment containers all grungy. Kitchen trash overflowing onto the floor. I've been in gas station bathrooms on the wrong side of town cleaner then this place. Chefs dripping with sweat. I was adventurous though, tasty gooey pork dishes and small skewers of goodness. The unusual tasting Crab rice kicked my daughter horizontal for two days. So maybe they were off their game for our visit, BUT \"NO MAS\"
4 ||| I was staying at the Pointe Hilton and figured to give this place a try after reading all the great reviews and seeing it was close.  I had the Chicken Al Momento , with salad and a cup of cream of  mushroom soup .  The salad was a balsamic vinigerette and it was pretty lame. It only came with one small tomato slice and no onions or pepperincinis like you get at many Italian Restaurants. The soup was ok and the Chicken Al Momento was ok , but it was served on a very small bed of spaghetti , I mean a box of pasta is about a buck and a half , put some more on the plate. The menu at this Phoenix location was very limited and being from Chicago I had higher expectations.
4 ||| This is the fourth and final place we stopped at yesterday. The sushi bar is small and there isnt much of a variety of rolls to choose from. The sushi chef was great and he asked for our likes and dislikes. He altered our rolls to our liking and they were very good. He handed us, in two seperate occasions, complimentary rolls that he felt we would like. They were both very good. We would like to give this place a solid 3 - 3.5 stars but as we checked out we found that we were charged for one of the complimenary rolls by the owner. Maybe it was a misunderstanding. Maybe we should have said something. We may go again because we really enjoyed the sushi chef and the rolls. The chef said he would \"hook us up\" next time but we're worried of the spying owner that may charge us again for a complimentary roll, but it wont happen twice without a fight from us. We'll see....
4 ||| I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.
1 ||| Happy Hour.  That's the only reason I will go to Macayo's.\n\nThe food is sub par.  I have no idea how it can be called authentic. \n\nI do have friends who love this place and of course, to each their own.  I just can't.  \n\nService is dependent upon the mood of your server.  You will either get prompt service with a smile, or the slowest service with a side of attitude!  If you're lucky you'll get the ever popular \"eye roll\".
1 ||| Make sure you bring your bullet proof vest to eat with you when you go to Carolina's Mexican Food because you are going to need it! Carolina's is located in the most ghetto neighborhood in all of Phoenix. It doesn't matter how hard they try to make this neighborhood look good with new fire stations and the like, it is still going to be ghetto. \n\nI had three tacos. I was hoping for taquitos but they were no where to be found on the menu. The tacos I did have cost $2 each and they weren't any better than what I could have gotten at Dell Taco. If I had gotten three tacos at Dell Taco I would have only paid $1.28, but here I paid $6. Tacos don't even have tomatoes on them! The food comes in take out containers regardless of whether or not you are eating in or out. Don't expect a lot of food because the containers are not that large. The food my co-workers got didn't look that much better than mine. \n\nThe inside of this place is a real dump. For as much money as this place brings in, you think they could update it or add more seating. Even a new paint job on the interior and exterior would go a long way. Somehow they think people enjoy the charm of a dirty Mexican restaurant. I don't think that many people care, because they are there just to eat and get back to work as soon as possible, not to enjoy themselves. \n\nIf you go here for lunch, you will end up waiting in a long line. And seating will be hard to find as the place is packed during lunch. Carolina's is probably better suited for take out. They serve food like a cafeteria; you order from the menu and they call your number. It is quick authentic Mexican food, without the fast-food nostalgia.
0 ||| At twilight care the receptionist typed in my sons birthday wrong (found out later) so the insurance would not go through.  They let my 9 month old projectile vomite for over an hour until we figured out her mistake.  She was very uncaring & rude.  She didn't care how sick he was, the insurance better come through.  After she corrected her mistate, they let us back.  The Doc on call said...nothing they could do take him to ER.  They could tell us that while he was vomiting & crying in the waiting room?!  SO UNCARING!
3 ||| They say the omelets are large here and they sure as hell aren't exaggerating. I came here with a large party and several of us were determined to finish their omelettes in one sitting. I was not among that company. Just getting through 2/3 of this monstrosity took an absurd amount of effort. \n\nI went with the cowboy, which is basically beef chilli and cheese in an already enormous (must be at least 4  or more eggs) contraption. The chilli is tasty- I had no problem wolfing it down. Bit of advice-- If you are feeling a bit of health guilt and opt for the wheat toast as I did, make sure to ask for it UNBUTTERED or else you will be treated to two gelatinous slabs of what used to be a healthy side dish. I can't say I was impressed with the fried potatotes-- they were extremely greasy and soft. In other words, not appetizing at all. Our party ordered some fried zucchini as well which came with some tasty ranch, and some not so appealing nacho cheese like substance.\n\nOur waitress was pretty friendly however, and I thought the coffee wasn't bad. And in terms of restaurants in vegas, this place is bordering on iconic-- it's a known landmark on Charleston and is often frequented by Old Vegas money. The selection is very impressive-- they basically have an omelette for every possible taste preference you can think of. If you're in the mood for a hearty dance with the devil to start off your day, this is your spot.
4 ||| We ended up here because of the reviews we saw on yelp, and we weren't disappointed.  Great appetizers and great food!!!
4 ||| My friends & I affectionately refer to this place as Mexican Disneyland (I think I stole that from an article on this place or something). Where else can you find bacon dogs, carne asada sold by the pound, bulk cheeses & yogurt, fresh tortillas, 8 or so flavors of agua fresca and chicharrone the size of a \"small person\" under one roof -- besides maybe, Mexico? \n\nMy favorite is the shrimp taco sold in the back of the market at the pescaderia (even though it takes them forever to make) and a large cup of watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberry or horchata agua fresca. It's the perfect meal before a Suns or Diamondbacks game and a hell of a lot cheaper too! \n\nThe produce also seems to be alot cheaper than what I normally see at Fry's & Safeway. Too bad I'm never headed straight home or else I'd buy groceries there.  \n\nAndale! Andale! to Phoenix Ranch Market!!
4 ||| I just love little places like Desert Jade, too cute!!  It had the charm of a restaurant back in the midwest. We started off with the pork dumplings, very moist and tasty. Just one negative a friend had the curry chicken it was a little too bland.  Overall I would definitely suggest this restaurant.
4 ||| Tried Prommare's a few weeks ago and it's my new go-to for Thai food.  It's the best I've had in town and is always consistently good.  The lunch specials are cheap with very large portions.  My favorite is the Kang Ped (red curry) and Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles)... highly recommend them, but everything I have tried is delicious.  I enjoy eating in but expect it to take around 45 minutes because it's always crowded!
2 ||| I guess if The Good Egg was the only breakfast place around, I'd give it 3 stars, but every time someone suggests eating there, here's my thought process: How about Over Easy? D'lish? Scramble? Oh, I know, Matt's Big Breakfast! Or Daily Dose? What about Breakfast Club? Or True Food for brunch? Literally anywhere else, please Jesus, save me from the mediocrity. \n\nThe Good Egg doesn't even set the bar particularly high for its eggs.. I mean, they only have to be \"Good\". Unfortunately, they suck. I have never had a good egg here, ever, nor a good anything else. Maybe because everything on the healthy menu tastes like cardboard and everything not on the healthy menu tastes like diabetes... but seriously. Sorry, establishment, but I've eaten at you about seven times now (against my will) and you are frustrating me with your lack of effort.\n\nPerhaps if the food was incredibly inexpensive (like how it tastes), I'd see the merit in eating here once in a while, for convenience's sake. The thing is... it's not even cheap. Plus, I can definitely make everything on their menu at home. Here's my recommendation: If you hate cooking as much as you hate eating interesting food, The Good Egg will suffice.
0 ||| This was the WORST service i have ever received in my life. I went with a group of friends on a Sunday night and the waitress decided that she had such a problem with me that she would not come and serve us while I was at the table. Then when I requested that the manager come over so I could speak to her about it, she was condescending to me and basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about. \nBesides the service the food was passable, but far from delicious. I will never be going back there after being treated like that.\nTheir only redeeming factor is that they have Franciskanner on tap.
1 ||| I should have known better!  Every restaurant, regardless of city and state seems to have issues.  Our party of four stopped here for a leisurely weekday lunch - showing up around 1:30.  We were promptly seated and our server was very nice and friendly.  We finally ordered: soups, sandwiches, and salads.  After what seemed an eternity, three of us were served.  Our waiter offered an apology for the kitchen, returned five minutes later with another, and once more with a third apology.  After 15 minutes the manager appears with the missing dish \"at no charge.\"  Come on folks!  It was only soup & salad, and for that we waited 30 minutes!!
3 ||| Have i mentioned this is my favorite Mexico City Mexican food joint?! W/out a doubt consistent, fresh and cheap. Whenever i am in AZ this is my spot. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=9vEQ2jKcRGjryTyVEvZDmA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=w1hAI5b7FWBJ1WNQzRpplg
3 ||| My wife and I had lunch here August 19, 2013 (Monday) based on our proximity and due to some favorable Yelp! reviews which said that it was \"authentic\" and/or good. We had the MaPo tofu and the Ho fun noodles with BBQ pork and I would vehemently disagree with those reviews which claimed the food was \"authentic\" and good. The menu is dominated with typical americanized chinese food items (which can be good - but good and authentic are very different things) but there are a few dishes which you don't typically see which lends the restaurant some apparent flavor of authenticity.  The Mapo Tofu was mostly flavorless and the strips of pork that you typically get with this dish, were, at this location, thick and coarse with a good amount of gristle. The sauce seemed diluted with only the green onion giving some \"asian\" flair. The Ho fun noodles with BBQ pork was a bit better in the sense that the noodles were not bad - but the BBQ pork was dry and cut along the grain instead of orthogonal to it which made it much tougher. The BBQ pork is also typically served in strips which are 1/8\" to 1/4\" thick with some fat on it - the BBQ pork on this dish was large, thin, dry sheets (cut the wrong way) of meat, which also did not taste very fresh. Now before the reader dismisses my review as from someone who doesn't know good chinese food, I am ethnically chinese (born and raised in Southern California eating chinese food for at least half my life), and have experienced both good and bad chinese food, with the best chinese food in Los Angeles, San Francisco and of course, Hong Kong. Based on my disappointing experience with these two dishes, I would not bother to visit this establishment again in the future unless there was a different chef.
1 ||| Is there a Rating system for Rip off and liars? They would be 5 Stars BAD!\n\nI took my truck into Brake Masters because the brakes were feeling a little off. I was thinking minor work nothing major. And my AC was being weird too.\n\nI get a call saying the good news is the AC will be $190 it has a burnt out resister and needs to be replaced. WHAT the good news is $190?\n\nThen on to the bad news, basically my entire sorry ENTIRE break system needs replacing, Master Cylinder, Front Brakes, Back, or and something was boiling and needs flushing. I'm sure there was more but I was in complete shock sorry SHOCK.\n\nSo I pick up my truck that I was convinced would not even make it home, and drove it to another Shop.\n\nScare tactics is want Brake Masters is about. I am not sure if it is because I am a woman or because I had the unfortunate choice of going to Brake Masters, but never again. And I will be sure to let everyone I know with a Vehicle, STAY AWAY!\n\nOh I got it fixed for $700 at a different place and nothing was wrong with my Master Cylinder. See my other review!
4 ||| So some friends came over to trim our trees, they know what they are doing better than I. As usual with friends they do not want anything for doing. But we feel they should be rewarded in some way so we took them to lunch here Toscano's. Having been so disappointed by my adventure yesterday with ordering a French dip I was still wanting a good one. So today I repeated my order here and it came out as it should, sliced thin and against the grain with a deep rich beef flavour. I was so happy I did not have to bitch once again. As usual the service here is friendly and the atmosphere and view of the driving range is nice.
1 ||| I stopped by Hinkley's yesterday to look for a light for our bathroom remodel. I've also been eying the very cool paper star lights they hang in their windows as I drive past on my way to work each day. \n\nI was in the place 15 minutes and was not greeted once. There seemed to be only one gal working at the time (with a customer), but not even a \"Hi there!\" \n\nThe shop has BEAUTIFUL lights, but the $650 one I loved is a bit out of my price range. Ok, WAY out of my price range. Even the paper stars were $30-40. Boo. \n\nMaybe there's a pocket of richies in Central Phoenix that can afford Hinkley's...but even if I could, I am turned off to shop here again....a simple \"hello\" would have been nice.
0 ||| I honestly only come here for the boba..\nService I don't care for, because well.. They don't give service at all.. If you're dining in, they take your order, bring your food and that's the last you see of them.\n\nTheir menu has varieties of the smoothies, teas, shaved ice and foods. My favorite items would be Taro Smoothie and their Chicken Wings. The other items and drinks are not too bad.\n\nWas never disappointed with food and drinks but the service sucks!
4 ||| Great food.  Reminds me of home cooked New Mexican food (yes, there is a difference).  There is one male owner? who is very much creepy when he's there, but everything else is outstanding.  Very clean.  Homey feeling.  Friends and I recommend it to anyone looking for Mexican food in our direction.
3 ||| The beer bottles on ice and great chicken wings make you feel like you're at an awesome tailgate party, all the way down to the port-a-potty bathrooms. If you're not too prim and proper, and you like to have a good time, JT's is the place. It's got a very regular Baja Arcadia crowd but is friendly to newcomers also. Put a couple of bucks in the jukebox and play Johnny Cash, kick back, and let the hours waste away.
2 ||| It's a Chipotle.  That means its consistent, you know what you're getting, and it's always fast.  If you haven't been to one before and you like fresh Mexican-style food, you have to try it.  Choose your ingredients so you get exactly what you want.\n\nThis location is surrounded by a lot of office buildings so it will be very packed every weekday during the lunch rush.  Show up by 11:45 and you'll be fine, but just after noon there will be a line out the door.  Still, it only takes about ten minutes to get through.  Or order using their iPhone app and you can walk to the front of the line, grab your stuff, and go.
3 ||| I think it's a shame the way people were bashing this place 2 years & 4 months ago when I last reported on it, & still now!  Mike C. & I were in today for the Lunch Buffet & here's how it was GOOD AGAIN:\n\n*  They are now up to 96 food items, plus sauces & dressings!\n\n*  The Hot & Sour Soup that I wasn't crazy about last time is a new recipe & it's good!\n\n*  Everything was good, especially the Honey Chicken, the boneless spare ribs, & the Mongolian BBQ featuring 4 meats was a treat at this price point.\n\nThe staff was friendly, everything was the right temperature & the blinds were still a mess (but I didn't come here to eat the blinds!).  It's down to a high 3 Stars from 4 only because I grade the Buffets more strictly now than I did 2 years ago (& I just got back from Vegas...  OMG!!.)  Anyhow, I still say  this place is TOTALLY A-OK!!     :-))\n\nLunch Buffet:  Weekdays $6.69/$6.02 Sr, Saturday & Sunday $8.49/$7.64 & they open at 10 AM daily.
3 ||| when you go there, make sure to ask for Ashley:)\nshe is really good and she made me feel like a priority.\noverall service good, a little crowded. \nshe specializes in gels and is there all the time. \nthe price was fair and i got to do shopping afterwards since it was cleverly placed inside the galleria mall.
2 ||| It's a big airport...but it's also an easy to navigate airport. You won't starve with the food selections, coffee is everywhere and it's fairly clean. I fly in and out of PHX a few times a year and I have never really had any issues. Just be careful existing because one wrong turn and you can wind up on the opposite end of Phoenix and it's a hassle to get back on track.
0 ||| My wifes new addiction...the farfalle is the bomb!
4 ||| A delicious gift was presented to me from this store -- soo tasty!! Had the marble cake -- wow!! Incredibly soft with that sweet cream cheese icing -- yummy!  Anytime you out looking for a great dessert or even a tasty treat -- go try that marble cake delight!
4 ||| Love this place.  This place served Thai, Malaya and some Vietnamese food here. My favorite for appetizer is the Indian pan cake (roti canai). Service a little slow but the food are great so it makes me forget about services HA. Enjoy!!!
3 ||| I called around for estimates for fixing a burned-out brake light, and Capitol City gave me the lowest estimate and invited me to stop by that afternoon. In less time than it took me to finish writing a shopping list--10 minutes at most--he fixed the problem. It was a great price and fantastic service: I never once felt foolish that I couldn't fix this problem myself, which is more than I can say for other places I've been. The atmosphere of the shop is pristine and comfortable, and is the sort of place I would be happy to wait for an hour (though I doubt I will ever have to).
3 ||| I should have walked a bit further some more bad mall food.\n\nThe food is reminiscent of Denny's burgers. Actually, I take that back, Denny's is probably better. It was nothing spectacular but what made my experience and EWWW was that I opted for a seat at the counter, where I could watch the food being prepared. Bad idea.\n\nEverything was dipped in butter before hitting the hot griddle also, I couldn't help but notice the filthy supposed-to-be-white uniforms everyone was wearing. Inmates have cleaner clothes.\n\nBecause this was in a mall, it was extremely busy and it took a while before the food made its way to us and even getting a refill was difficult. \n\nI do like the 50s music and liked singing along obnoxiously. I felt bad for the servers when they had to dance/perform for the patrons. You could tell that they hated it and it was not worth the $3/hr to work here.
4 ||| I really enjoy eating here! The price is very reasonable, the cashier and server are very attentive and helpful. I only wish they were open on Sundays! Have the delicious chicken pho and taro bubble tea!!
4 ||| Very nice for the price! Comfortable, clean, and about a mile away from Las Vegas Blvd.
2 ||| Ehhh..  For a sort-of-celebrity chef Lidia Bastianich (business partner to Mario Batalli) I was totally UNimpressed with the sunday brunch.  Thank god I haven't bought her cookbook.\n\nI ordered the Pasta Tasting - and I wish I hadn't.  The whole wheat Paparelle was sugary, the penne a la vodka was watery, and the raviolle was soaked in butter. My parents meals were better, which is why I've given three stars. \n\nThat said, the atmosphere was beautiful and the antipasta and dessert tables were nicely laid out.  \n\nThe kitchen is half open behind the bar, and unlike the open kitchens in NYC where the aestitics of the kitchen are well planned out, this kitchen had four colored pots and pans thrown on top of the shelves to make it look pretty. Umm, four pots?  and an industrial kitchen? not so cute.\n\nSadly, I didn't not love this place.
2 ||| I was delivered a sandwich yesterday by one sick lady.  When I told her it was not okay for a delivery driver to deliver sick, she simply stated that everyone gets colds and that someone had to do it - oh, and that she didn't MAKE the food.  When I called to complain to the manger, I was told that that is who delivered my sandwich!  \n\nI called the owner of the company, Terry Green, and he stated that they had no other option, as everyone was sick and they were short staffed.  Wonder why.  I would guess another employee came to work sick, and made the rest of the staff sick!  I told him that his other option was to not have deliveries for the day!  \n\nI would suppose that to some people, their company making money, not paying employees for sick time, is just okay.  The public should beware of someone so careless with our health to make a few dollars!
0 ||| It's by no means a Japanese restaurant. The only thing I think real is the instant miso soup. Don't ever order Sukiyaki Udon! I am so disappointed by it.
1 ||| I was one of three women who ate here on a Thursday night while here for business.  We got seated right away, but after that the service was slow and I had to keep asking for drink refills.  The 3 rolls that were brought out came with a really good flavored butter.  We were never asked if we wanted more or how things were.  We just ordered 3 salads and 3 appetizers and all were good portions and very good tasting too, and worth the prices.\n\n  We didn't know ahead that if you spend $50 you could get your Westin parking validated, we had paid $10 to park just across the street but that didn't count.
4 ||| Never a delay and that's why I am a fan!
1 ||| Writing this review breaks my heart.\n\nMultiple generations of my family have come here; my grandfather brought my dad as a young boy when in Phoenix for business in the '30s (with cattle all around back then); all of us kids had our 16th birthday in the Pink Room; my uncle would visit from dry SLC and my dad would treat him to martinis and dinner at Stockyards; it was the place for serious dates, the place we unanimously chose to go for dinner when we were all home, and so many good times.\n\nWhen Tom and his crew took it over back in the 90s, he essentially left its classics alone. For lunch you could have a burger or orgasmic BBQ beef sandwich to die for; for dinner you could surf and turf and enjoy yourself more than you could at the high rent district places. Oh, the biscuits and  what we called \"crack honey butter\" - one died and went to heaven, it was so good.\n\nThen it closed for renovations - much needed and overdue; the electrical was shaky back then, part of its charm - and everyone I know looked forward to its reopening.\n\nThey killed it. The look was the same, but the food.. oh no. My dad was in mourning for months. I tried it again several months later - same thing. Tried it with husband some months after that.. same thing. I was even there in February (2011) after over a year of absence, and if anything, the menu got more trendy and more cutesy and more expensive. So much for my birthday treat to myself. So you see, I want to come back, but they killed the perfection of simpler, tasty, perfectly prepared meals in favor of the rare, the trendy, and the expensive.\n\nPrickly pear butter? Jalapenos in the cornbread? While the steaks are fine, all the cutesy crap on the menu seems to me as if they're trying to attract tourists a la Scottsdale... what a travesty. It's not just an long-time patron and family lamenting the old days; it's the truth. \n\nIt can't be explained by being screwed by the light rail line or \"changing tastes.\" It's called they want to attract the business, moneyed and trendy crowds and that's the reason why you'd better bring your platinum card here.\n\nIf an edgy, expensive steakhouse is what you're looking for, this is it. If not, go to Morton's for the money.
1 ||| Cannot say enough bad things....and I have been a customer for 4years but......Brought two suits in for tailoring and picked them up ruined to the point they could not be worn nor fixed. After the lady behind the counter finally identified herself as the owner I was told I would be refunded the fee for tailoring. That was all that was offered including never apologizing for damaging beyond repair, two expensive suits which when you are a tall person very hard to find.  \nI was told to get receipts as she the owner Lynn Lutzker did not want to over reimburse me!!, (the horror of that after her tailor ruined the suits), and she sells the suit maker so knows the prices. Upon further inquiring about reimbursement or some type of compensation once she realized I was taking her up on it she told me she would not offer any nor did I ever get a simple apology!..
3 ||| Dr. Gregory Bell is my physician and I would definitely recommend him!!  I would have rated this place a 5 if it were just baed on him.  I can honestly say he is the only dr. that I have ever had that I like and trust!  He actually listens and asks questions and is very smart.  He takes the time to educate me on my health.  I've had asthma my entire life and had other drs try to shove new inhalers on me that I didn't like, didn't work and were very expensive.  Dr. Bell was the first dr to actually run some asthma tests on me and told me that my type of asthma wouldn't be helped by those inhalers anyway.  Great doctor that I trust!\n\nThe office itself is ok.  I've had them mess up my appointments a few times which is frustrating but the dr. has always made sure I can still get in to see him.
0 ||| The service is absolutely horrible. The staff is rude and acts put out by your mere presence!
1 ||| The Thai carved wood and overall decor is amazing- and the service was fine. Sorry to disagree with others, but my wife and I found the food to be quite ordinary and well-below quality at other Thai restaurants we visit. \n\nThe fried spring rolls were greasy- possibly were just fried a second time to get them hot. The Mee Krob was a good appetizer except the lettuce was partially wilted and brown in spots. I usually love pad thai but what was served had soggy noodles and not a lot of taste. \n\nPerhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night I was there. Not likely to try again though.
3 ||| All of the previous reviews are spot-on. I've been to Color Me Mine about half a dozen times and always enjoy the experience. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Be sure to inquire about various effects that you can be taught to make your pottery piece even more interesting. They have stencils and stamps for those who are less artsy than others.
3 ||| This place is OK. The portions are tiny for the price and it's more Americanized than the other restaurants in town.
0 ||| Terrible this will be their final chance, after an hour half they forgot to vacuum the back!! There was trash under the seats, windows had streaks . The exterior had dried water spots . R u kidding me ??!
2 ||| got a pancake and double americano. Both were really good. Pancake was maybe a bit underdone but overall it was all very good. Didn't need to sugar the coffee.
1 ||| Notice the word \"market\" over the door, it is NOT a good thing. My family was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food that was served. The portions were smaller, the lettuce wraps tasted like burnt oil, the king pao chicken was mystery meat that included something pointy. This is decidedly NOT pei wei junior, it is much lower on the quality scale.
2 ||| I went with the suggestions of Yelpers and stopped in to Coach and Willie's for drinks pre- Dbacks game.  It was a good choice, I think.  I didn't care for the outside which has loud music playing but inside it's a nice pub (upscale is a bit of a stretch...) with lots of TVs tuned to sports.  We were able to snag two seats at the bar and even ordered some nachos.  \n\nA few thoughts:\n\nStanding room is kind of scarce.  If it ever got really packed you would have to stand around people at tables eating and while I don't really care I know that its something my husband doesn't like to do.  \n\nIt took forever to get the bartenders to notice us and take our orders.  And we were sitting at the bar!  When our nachos came they were asking for the \"S.\" party and we were flailing our arms in front of the bartender and screaming \"that's us!\" and she still didn't see us!\n\nThe bartenders were pretty cool.  They made some futile attempts to get a \"Let's Go Dbacks\" chant going but the crowd wasn't that into it.  (And at that point there weren't that many Cubs fans there...)  They had a good healthy banter with the Cubs fans which was amusing.   They didn't care when we ordered shots of Jager, although the two female Cubs fans next to us were shocked.  (Sorry, this is just how we roll.  We don't take shots of whatever that nuts and berries concoction that you're drinking is....)  \n\nThe nachos were strange.  The chicken was like grade F chicken and there was a lot of the fixings but they were not well layered at all.   There was a ton of stuff on top (including all the guac and sour cream) then a bunch of naked chips and then a whole ton of cheese and all the beans on the bottom.  We also asked for jalapenos on the side, but they just didn't give them to us at all.\n\nI would definitely go back here before a game again.  It was a good relaxed atmosphere and a quick walk over to the stadium.  However, I think I'll probably stick with drinking there and save my munchies for the ballpark.
3 ||| We went to Four Peaks for a late dinner with friends. We are all big fans of their brews so that was the main appeal. They didn't have a ton of vegetarian options but my husband and I split the portabella veggie beer bread. I wasn't super impressed but again, we were primarily there for the beer. Nothing goes down like a peach ale on a hot Arizona night :)
0 ||| Beautiful view, but surely the worst meal i have ever had. My eggs rancheros had no flavor! How is that possible?? And Scott's Benedict was so bland! These cooks clearly hate their jobs and are surely sabotaging it.
1 ||| I've been here about three times now and every time he is on the phone for most of my haircut.  He is constantly stopping mid-haircut to answer it while you wait for him.  This causes him to lose his place while cutting your hair and miss parts.  The last two times I've been there I get home and realize he's missed places so I have patches of longer hair.  I'm not sure why he thinks this is an acceptable business practice and he lost my business after he did it this time.  Just settle for Super Cuts is all I can say.  They're cheaper and give you their full attention.
1 ||| RA is the worst place to go for sushi. They are owned by the Benihana corporation... so that should explain everything. RA is the Samauri Sam's for sushi. Test kitchen prepped with a marketing team to sell food based on quirky names for different rolls.\n\nThis RA is located in a shopping complex next to a movie theater. They have a decent bar and a great happy hour drink menu. That's about it. Don't eat there. Their fish doesn't taste very fresh and their rolls... well, they come out looking so fancy. But that's it. Just a pretty face. \n\nPrices are a little steep considering they serve 2nd rate sushi. You can find fresher tastier rolls at Safeways.
3 ||| Yum. Signature Mama all the way. This is a great place, no matter how you slice it.
3 ||| I've been living here for almost 2 years now. The property is quiet, conveniently located, and seems to be well maintained.\n\nAny issues I've had, maintenance is fast to respond. Usually within a day or 2. Some cases have been immediate.\n\nI had an issue with my a/c last summer. Since they weren't able to fix it that night, they gave me the key to a vacant unit that happened to be above me so I wouldn't be stuck in the heat.\n\nThe neighbors all seem to know each other and the complex staff are friendly. It is a no-crime complex, which means that they won't allow someone to live here if they have a criminal background. There's even a police officer that lives here.\n\nThe units themselves seem a little older, but not falling apart. Appliances are all newer. Insulation is a little thin, so I would recommend going for an inner unit or one without a wall exposed to the sun.\n\nOverall, it is a very good place to live. Not the best, but far from the worst.
1 ||| I realize that most people who need a phone usually don't check reviews on Yelp, but for those that do, stay away from this location. These people are trained to tell bald face lies in order to make sales. The reason I say trained is because I've seen a pattern with the employees. I was told in March of 2011 that I should buy a 4G Samsung 1 because 4G would be coming out any day. A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.\n\nAlso I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet. After about 6 visits to this location for tech support, we end up resetting the thing each time, but if I'm in the field, and since that's required every single time I use it, I might as well just use my phone for internet and save 10-15 minutes. I paid $100 of this Piece of cr..p thing and $37 per month and they flat out refuse to let me out of the contract.\n\nI was being sarcastic when the manager after several tech support visits between my phones and MIFI asked me my name and I told him he should know it by now, and his response was that I should be thankful that at least someone was helping me.\n\nIt's damn near a monopoly, but not quite. There's still Verizon and T-Mobile, and god forbid running a business with Cricket, which is a small step down from Sprint.
1 ||| I am going to get right to the point...they have some cool stuff for sale at good prices...hence 2 stars. Otherwise, their customer service is ghetto and sucks!!! What a shame!!!!!! End of story!!!!!!!!!
2 ||| have left two messages for two different people in the service department, 60 hrs later, still no call back.\n\npretty bad service.\n\nhad an acura mdx before, awesome experience.
3 ||| I wouldn't ordinarily review a Baskin-Robbins 'cos it's a big chain and you get the same product everywhere, but the guy working behind the counter was so enthusiastic and friendly I had to mention it. He greeted everybody as they walked in, gave suggestions on the product (I said I liked the reese's peanut butter cup after I sampled it, and then he wanted me to sample the heath too for contrast), encouraged additional samples (\"hey have you tried THIS?\"), cracked jokes in his european accent, and then later, as we were sitting there working our way through our ice creams, he brought by little dixie cups of chocolate shake (\"hey, a guy just ordered a shake and there was some leftover in the blender so I'm bringing you some!\") ...and finally a \"Bye, please come again\" in the most totally sincere manner...
3 ||| I get confused when the name of the place changed from Native New Yorker to Native Grill & Wings....  yet the reviews are still under NNY.  We have eaten here since 1979 where it all started in Tempe.  We have noticed the wings seem to get smaller and smaller as time goes by.  Maybe they are Cornish Game Hen wings or pigeon wings but hey, we have NEVER seen wings that small!  They taste good but you need at least twice the number to fill up.  My previous review was 5 stars but that was many years ago, how sad.  Goodbye NNY/NGW, sad to see you change like that.
4 ||| I like how close it is to my house. The service was great and my lunch was delicious. I think the amount of food was just right, but it was a bit pricey, especially for lunch. I did like the ambiance and I hope to eat there again so I can try the cream cheese pie
3 ||| Still as good as I remembered! \n\nThis visit around I tried the following:\nAlcapurrias (Picadillo stuffed croquette made from tropical vegetable masa)\nTostones (Twice-fried green plantains)\nArroz con Gandules (Pigeon peas cooked with rice, pork, olives and capers)\nMofongo (Crushed plantains and pork cracklings)\nSangria made with Red wine\nCortadito (Caf\u00e9 Cubano laced with steamed milk)\n\nBetween the Tostones & the Calypso chips, I prefer the Calypso chips. \nThe Arroz con Gandules is very good, you can really taste the saltiness of the capers.\nThe Mofongo were my absolute FAVORITES :D  They are very basic, but who needs more?!\nAs far as the Cortadito goes, I'm pretty sure that I could feel my pupils dilating as I was drinking the tiny cup down, lol. If this is a diluted Cuban Coffee, I'm not sure I'm ready for the real deal! Even though it was strong, or perhaps because it was so strong, I feel like I'm hooked! :) \n\nWord of warning, if you don't like garlic, you need to really consider your choices. I don't think there are many dishes made without the use of garlic.
0 ||| Was going to have a fun day with my kids and use our pogo passes to get in, customer service scanned one of the tickets twice and then wouldn't allow me to use it because it had been used.  Even though I show on my app pass that it was scanned right then on that day. Waited for half and hour and argued with the manager.  No help.   The people before me has that problem as well.   And they argued with her as well.
2 ||| Horrendous food - like someone who has never cooked before tried to recreate German delicacies using only their imagination and ingredients from the supermarket in the bad part of town.\n\nI ordered beef rouladen with cabbage and bacon, the beef was tough, the cabbage tasted like it came out of a can, and the brown sauce covering it all was like something the worst Chinese food restaurant in Nebraska would put on its chicken and broccoli. A floppy  uncooked piece of bacon found floating in this sauce was nausea inducing. The waiter, who could see how uncomfortable I was took it away and I ordered potato pancakes, feeling relatively confident that any restaurant can handle latkes. Another disaster - that I ate because I was two beers deep at that point - greasy, soggy giant discs of grated potato that had a raw taste and texture. If it weren't for the generous amount of sour cream and apple sauce - which I have to assume weren't made in house - I would have sent those back too. As is after eating their potato pancakes I went to another restaurant to have an actual meal, because I had been made joyless and despondent by Penn Brewery's failure to accomplish the most simple kitchen tasks. \n\nThe beer is okay, not nearly as good as Church Brew Works and definitely not memorable considering the competitive landscape in the world of craft brewing - and I say that not even having traveled to that many brewery/restaurants, so even on its home turf Penn beer is forgettable. The service was appropriately apologetic considering the garbage plated that night and the space itself is well laid out and attractive. As is I would never go back, I might be tempted if I had strict assurances that the current management and culinary team were thrown out ala Kitchen Nightmares but even then I would need to see a good review. Thanks to the waiter in the white shorts who didn't charge me for the food, I hope you lead a coup and save the Penn Brewery from itself.
1 ||| Probably won't go back. The food was just whatever and the service was poor. They ran out of many items including brownies, baked potatoes, and bread and they didn't restock until I was leaving. And they also completely ran out of cookies and weren't planning on making more. The salad bar was decent, but everything else wasn't so great. So if you want strictly salad then it's worth a try, otherwise don't bother. Also make sure you look for coupons online before going. I registered on their website and got emailed a buy one get one meal, so it was just about $12.00 for two people.
4 ||| Some of the best chicken I've had, moist and chalk-full of flavor .  waffles were spot on as well!  Can't go wrong with a place that serves Kool-Aid!
0 ||| BARF BARF BARF\n\nQuite possibly the grossest food I have ever eaten.  The chicken lo mien was made with spam-ish meat product-- Does that make is Spamish meat product lo mien? I ended up eating just white rice and soy sauce with egg rolls--- can't mess up fried egg rolls right?  I did have to salt them though, they were pretty taste-less. \n\nThe ambiance is less than desirable as well, our plates never got cleared and the amount of unshowered people sitting near me made me want to go home and take a hot bath with all the soap in the world.  \n\nI will not return to Lim's and I suggest you not go either.
3 ||| I have been excited to check this place out for months.  Unfortunately my excitement ended after the hush puppies.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi blackened, with a baked potato and salad.  The salad was alright, the Mahi Mahi obviously was frozen as it was dry and my onion rings.  Oh wait I didn't order onion ring but that is what I received.  So I asked them to bring out my baked potato.  I opened it up and I know the saying \" a little dirt never hurt\" but since they were baked the dirt turned to mud and it was all over my potato in clumps.  Needless to say I didn't eat it, sent it back and they offered me another salad as a courtesy.  Which I declined. \n\nI wanted so bad to like this place, since it is hard to get my wife to go to any place that specializes in seafood.    The hush puppies were really good, but it is hard not to like deep fried corn cornmeal batter covered in honey butter.  Other than that, it was nice that kids eat free on Wednesday's which was the only saving grace of this meal that I didn't have to pay for their meals.
3 ||| I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  \n\nI ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the \"Godfather\" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- \ndried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!\n\nThanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!
0 ||| PRICEY! thats all! :-) Staff is very friendly but holy shit are they expensive!
0 ||| Horrible service. False Advertising. High Prices.  Went here for lunch and my fiance was excited because the burger came with \"Unlimted Fries\".  Put in our orders for two burgers (his with fries, mine fruit--I do like the option of getting fruit with my burger) within minutes of sitting down.  However, it took 20 minutes to get our food.  The place was NOT busy. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of open seats at the bar, where we were seated.  \n\nAbout 5 minutes after getting our food, my fiance let them know that he would like more fries.  We finished eating, and waited for the fries.  And waited for fries. And waited for fries.  20 minutes we sat there and waited. They continually told us \"They'll be up soon\" and \"Your fries are on the way\".  I did make a point to communicate with the waitress that I needed to get back to work, and continually asked how much longer it would be, and eventually asked if we could get them in a to-go box because I was already late to work. However, the waitress seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than our needs.  This is for LUNCH TIME.  Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer.  \n\nIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries.  I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting.  I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. \n\nPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited.  Ridiculous. Left the bar paying $7 for a small cheeseburger and still feeling incredibly hungry, ripped off and PISSED.
4 ||| Weird illuminati pyramid as you drive up from the south = coolest thing about this place.
1 ||| I'll start by saying we didn't eat here, we just wanted refreshments on a hot day!  The place is cute, clean and I would've thought about going back to have something to eat if ever in the area.  \n\nBut, their service is horrible - absolutely rude and condescending.  If you are able to make out what they are saying . . . I don't speak Chinese so perhaps that's on me, but I didn't realize that's what it took.  There were two females at the counter when we walked up and one just looked at us (yes, we were clothed, yes, we were clean, and yes, we smiled when we walked in) and the other said, \"what u like?\"  Whoa, wait a minute!  The bartender kept looking at me, but never smiled and never offered to help, much less mutter a \"hello\".  Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! \n\nI had a Green Tea Boba Tea and my daughters and their friend had strawberry and passion fruit snow ice, that also was tasty and they said it was yummy.  I am pretty sure fresh fruit is used as the mango snow ice is deemed 'seasonal' and it wasn't available as that is typically a summer fruit.  My tea was good, but not enough to bring me back to bad service.  There's no excuse, there are many other tea houses in the area.  Call me spoiled . . .
4 ||| My husband and I love this location!  Every single visit we are greeted and seated quickly, our food comes out perfectly and with very little wait.  All of our severs are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  The restaurant itself is clean and the managers are always available and helpful.  \n\nTiffany, a host, is an absolutely sweetheart.  She knows our favorite spot and always finds the time to have a small chat with us.  Even if we hated everything else about this location (which is utterly impossible), her friendliness alone would be enough to keep us as regulars.\n\nThanks for all the great meals, Stephanie crew!
3 ||| Whoa hold the phone. I didn't know anything about this $1.25 Well Drink special on Thursdays so I will certainly have to revisit this spot. \n\nI have eaten here a few times, as a friend of mine is a big fan of this place, but I just couldn't see it. It felt like he was talking about a girl he thought was attractive and she gets built up and built up and when you finally meet her you have no idea what he was talking about. She isn't ugly, but you probably wouldn't have gone as far as to say she is all that great, either. \n\nMaybe I haven't ordered the right thing, so next time I head in I'll try something new alongside my dollar cocktail.
3 ||| Overall, I like this place and will eat here again.  My family of 4 tried this place on a Sunday early afternoon.  The place was not crowded, but walking in we weren't sure whether to seat ourselves or wait.  So after a minute of waiting, we just decided to sit down.  It took awhile to get menus or a drink order although the waitress did acknowledge us after we got seated.  She was very friendly and once we were finally waited on, the service was great.\n\nThe food was good - portions were enormous!  My daughter had the mac and cheese which she loved (it had roasted red peppers in it which was yummy).  I had a nacho burger. I liked it, but it was so sloppy it shouldn't have come with a bun.  In fact, I ended up eating it with a fork and leaving the bun on the plate.  I think any of the other burgers would have been better - the burger itself was good but the flavors of the \"nacho\" toppings did nothing for me.\n\nI like that they bring out little pitchers of soda so you don't have to wait for refills.  I don't know why, but that was kind of cool. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. The d\u00e9cor was not memorable but for a family meal in a diner like this, we didn't come here for the d\u00e9cor.  \n\nThe prices were average but the portions were worth it.  We'll try Henry's again one day for sure.
3 ||| Coming from Southern California, I've been fairly disgruntled with the Mexican food in Vegas since moving here 14 months ago. But despite this place being down the street, we didn't try it until recently, skeptical -- but are glad we did!\n\nThe atmosphere is kind of like On the Border Meets Islands (if you're familiar with that chain) . The food seems to be a mix between the Tex-Mex I recall from living in Dallas and California-style mexican food. It's a little more on the tex-mex side, I'd say, though you can get shredded or ground beef, if beef's your thing.\n\nThe chips don't appear to be homemade, so that's a bummer for me, but they're still pretty tasty. And the salsa is a nice smoky chipotle.  Chips and salsa is a So Cal staple which we've struggled to find here, for some reason.\n\nThe fajitas I had were good, too. Were they may favorite ever? No, but I'd order them again! Their beans are delicious, too. I'm not as big of a fan of their rice as my boyfriend is -- he LOVES it -- but it's also quite tasty.  \n\nThey have a nice selection of items and we've gone back sevearl times now -- once to dine-in and we've gotten food to go from them a few times. Their service has always been really great, friendly, especially the bald-headed gentleman -- REALLY nice and personable.  \n\nGreat, now I want Que Mas for dinner...
0 ||| This is the worst Churchs Chicken I have ever visited.  This is the second time in two visits that they have been out of chicken at 4:30 in the afternoon!  Had to wait 20 min to get Chicken and old tasting side dishes.  This location has a real bad management issues - avoid this place!
2 ||| We went here on a Saturday afternoon and no one was at the front counter.  It's obvious that this is a small mom & pop type operation, which is encouraging because this usually means good food.  But we wouldn't know because no one ever came to the counter.  \n\nThere was one couple at a table eating, but no other customers at the time.  There was a dude walking around in the back, he looked right at us, but didn't acknowledge us in any way.  \n\nWe stood there for quite a while and looked over the menu repeatedly, hoping that at any moment someone might come forth and say something as simple as \"I'll be right with you\" etc.  Didn't happen.  \n\nI get the whole idea of them not being fast food, and that good food takes time so on and so forth, but that shouldn't also mean \"we will not acknowledge your presence.  Ever.\"  \n\nThree more people came in behind us and proceeded to wait.  There were then five of us crowding around the counter................waiting...................and waiting...........\n\nHere on Yelp I noticed that one complaint had a response from the business, which gives me some hope, but hey guys, I was there, with money in hand and you dropped the ball.........again apparently.  \n\nWe walked out after waiting a longgggggg time for nothing.   We may try again some day when we have absolutely nothing better to do.  However, if this is standard operating procedure I don't know that they'll still be around for that \"some day.\"
3 ||| Went here for Sunday brunch and had an overall positive experience.  The dining room area is nicely maintained with enough space between tables to be intimate without being too intimate.  We sat outside and the view of the lake is great.  The patio area is covered in a fancy banquet style tent material that is functional but not tacky or cheap looking.  The only potentially confusing thing about this place is that the front is a wine store, with a wine tasting bar and doesn't automatically register as a hostess stand where one would go to seek seating.\n\nThe service was excellent.  We had read from previous reviews about an infamous Tracy, but both spoke with her on the telephone prior to coming and were promptly seated by her.  Our server was excellent and attentive.\n\nI had the Eggs Bennedict with blue crab.  It was appropriately apportioned, tasty and served with option for caesar salad.  My wife had the lobster croissant.  The lobster croissant was an excellent blend of lobster meat in a light sauce with tomato and avocado.  The frites were thin, delicious and made a good accompaniment to the lobster croissant.\n\nI would recommend dining here.  Personally, I'm looking to trying a cheese plate and some of the wines.
0 ||| We are here in Vegas fo a 4 days vacation with kids and friends. Craving for some VN foods and went to Pho Kim Long. Foods was ok but the service was horrible. We needed some scoops for our pho soup that none of the bowl had come with. We ask for them but the guy/owner didn't even acknowledge me while I am looking at him for about a minute then he asked what do I need. I thought that was insulting. One of the friends ask for some condense milk. The response of the waiter was what do you need it for. That was unnecessary. Because it is open early we like to start our day early. We like to enjoy our precious day here in NV. Thanks Pho Kim Long for ruin our day. Just a friendly reminder for who is looking an enjoyable vacation please avoid this place at all cost. For us we will never come here again. Hope they will learn to share their customer with a little respect. If there is an option with zero star rating. I will rate them zero star rating.

4 ||| Although it leans on the pricey side of Phoenix cuisine, Houston's is by far one of my favorite places to go out for a nice dinner. Their veggie burger is beyond amazing (I always get the couscous on the side which is also delicious).\n\nOn a recent trip, my boyfriend ordered the ribs on a recommendation. He said they were by far the best ribs he has ever enjoyed.
3 ||| Nothing says family like 40th St. Cafe. My family and I have been going to 40th St Cafe since I was a kid and it has a special place in my heart.  My mom was at 40th St Cafe every day for coffee, many days for lunch, and we often went for dinner. Being a single mom, raising two boys, she also was allowed to pick up shifts to earn extra money. When she was hospitalized for pneumonia, the cafe fed my brother and I. One of her dreams was to take us back to New York and show us where she grew up, but we could never afford it. . After she was diagnosed with cancer, the cafe staff, and some of the regulars raised enough money to send my mom, brother, and I to New York for a week with spending money. Our whole family was also there for a big reunion. It is a trip we will never forget. 5 years ago, we lost my mom to breast cancer. Every year, the cafe participates in the Walk for the Cure in honor of my mom and others that have passed. \n  I live in Gilbert now, so I do not go as often as I would like, but any opportunity to get to that side of town, 40th St Cafe is where I will go. Peggy's Pies are incredible! Best in the valley. If you like good home cooked meals, this is the place to go. I usually end up ordering the Cobb Salad with Blue Cheese dressing. They make their own Blue Cheese, and it is amazing, different than what you are used to. I also love their Guacamole Burger. For breakfast, you cannot go wrong with the Ultimate Skillet. \n  So if you are anything like me and like to bring business to people who really go the extra mile to make a difference in people's lives, then go check it out. You won't be sorry you did. :)
0 ||| How to go from first to worst in six short months.  There once was a time when this place served the best food in the city.  They have a new person working in their kitchen who is single-handedly destroying their business.  I have had to send back every plate of food this creep has prepared.  Today will be the last time I will visit this establishment.  I have made my displeasure known on several occasions - to no avail.  I kept coming back hoping the quality would improve.  I used to look forward to coming to the Roasting Company, now I find myself repulsed - all because of one crappy employee.  If you decide to eat here, I'd advise avoiding anything that is made with rice - unless you enjoy rice swimming in an excessive amount of  yucky, milky, buttery film!  WTF is that junk?  Who trained this idiot?  I'd give ZERO STARS if it was an option.
3 ||| Came here tonight with my boyfriend and 2 out of our 4 kids. The waitress was really nice. The wait time wasn't bad. I had the grilled chicken Caesar salad and it was really good. The others had a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, peppers, etc on it. Both kids (2&3) each ate a 1/2 slice and the boyfriend ate 3. So I'm assuming they all enjoyed it! I would love to come back on a cheat meal day and really try some of their other stuff out. Only negative is the prices are a tad high.
3 ||| 3 1/2 Stars***Decent entree. Had the lamb with spinach and rice. Really enjoyed it. The hummus was bland though. Service was better than expected. I ordered an extra rice to go, and was not charged. Nor was i charged for my club soda. \n\nWill return.
0 ||| they fucked up my sandwhich, and my waiter was a total douche.\n\n\nnot to mention my disgusting warm \"iced tea\" that i paid nearly $5 for.\n\ntheir salads and availability of my favorite beer [hoegaarden], redeem them with a whopping 3 stars.\n\neeeeeeehhhh.
4 ||| This place is bombskies.  We got the combo plate (meat jun, kalbi, and BBQ chicken) and the kalbi plate to go.  I'll admit that the $17 kalbi plate with 4 slices of kalbi was a little more pricey than it should have been.  However, that was probably the only setback we had with this restaurant.  Even though we were only getting take-out, the service was awesome.  Employees were smiling, friendly to customers, and really turned \"just picking up some food\" to an experience which makes me want to try this place again (and wouldn't mind dine in).\n\nThis really is an island style Korean BBQ kinda place.  The plates even came with kimchee and mac salad.  Definitely worth going back for!
1 ||| So, I came to visit a friend in Arizona and after a weekend of hearing about this place, we came here for our farewell lunch. Poor decision. \n\nPerhaps I am just spoiled by Mexican food in my area (and the fact that I am half Mexican and often cook Mexican food at home), but the food was awful. \n\nBetween my husband and myself, we ordered an Enchilada sampler and a Bean & Cheese Burrito - simple right? Apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place. The green sauce on one of the enchiladas was more of a cream sauce with cheese - seriously disgusting. The bean and cheese burrito obviously used canned beans instead of anything fresh and the tortilla was crispy (not on an awesomely good way either). \n\nOur server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent (the original is refreshing and good with a meal, the strawberry I could have passed on), which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review.\n\nIf you are in search of awesome Mexican food, this is NOT it. If you want a super sub par meal with mediocre drinks, head on it.\n\nI will likely not be back, ever...unless it is at my friend's request - even then, it's a maybe.
1 ||| C section was very empty when we fly out on a Monday night. Security lined moved quickly and it's a pretty clean airport. The water from the filter water refill station tasted salty and gross though.
0 ||| Worst salsa I have ever tasted. They also would not modify the menu to fit my request. What kind of place doesn't modify a menu for a customer. I will not return!
2 ||| This store has everything, but its a bit pricier than Home Depot.  One complaint I have about this store is that the register checkout is always really slow.  I'm not sure why.  The Ace Hardware at Missouri and 7th Ave is a much nicer and quicker experience, but this location does seem to offer better prices.
1 ||| TW raised my internet rates twice in 18 months and called it \"a discount\", WTF.  \n\nWhen it runs it's super fast (33m) but the connection is erratic. Customer service is typical for telecoms and the installation was sloppy. \n\nThe only reason I have to give them two stars is because I was stuck for years with Comcast and that was MUCH worse.
4 ||| Wow!  As good as I had hoped after seeing it on DDD!  Had a regular sausage and the guinea pie!  Homemade meatballs and a garlic sauce with spinach...Excellent!  A must eat at if you are in Vegas!
2 ||| Not often you go into a place with a person's name on the door and find that person working the register or cooking, but that's what you will find at Al's.\n\nBeen going here for a few years, but haven't tried much of the menu - the Chicago dogs and fries are just too good. Also recommend the beef sandwich, which comes juicy, tangy, and messy. And let me tell you, some of the best things in life are messy.
3 ||| We are fans of Pistella Beer Distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in Pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing.  It's a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection.  I don't remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so far...it shows $$$$.  I'm sure they have some nice stuff, but we just got a case of beer (I think one of those Magic Hat variety packs) and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores.  Anyway, we had a good experience with this place and don't really have anything bad to say about them.
3 ||| Poor Silver Mine Subs being right next to Subway. Unfortunately, their subs don't do much to differentiate themselves from Subway which makes Subway the better buy. That being said, they do have much more amiable employees than the Subway next door. Also, there's free wifi here.
3 ||| Five stars for their wide selection of choices and toppings. Seriously hugeeeee menu. Their ice cream is really smooth and soft and tasty. I've been eating custard cup since I was a little girl in Danville so Custard Cup and I go way back.\n\nIt is kind of semi-expensive nowadays though. I'd be nice if things were about 30-50cents cheaper.\n\nI usually keep it simple with a chocolate chip cookie dough Snowstorm. The smallest size makes me full. \n\nTheir ice cream/custard is seriously like the best I've ever had EVER.. ANYWHERE. I can vouch this for their vanilla and lemon custards.\n\nMinus one for cash only. I hate carrying cash.
3 ||| There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place. Seemingly not a ringing endorsement, but when you take into account the surroundings of this joint, you will recognize that the mere fact that this place doesnt suck means that it is A-OK. \n\nConfused? Don't be. This place looks like an absolute murder-me-in-the-bathroom-and-serve-me-as-patty-melts-next-Tuesday shithole. Its not. Its a moderately divey outdated (vintage 1986 decor, probably ironic in hipsters' eyes) bar and grill. High points include a pretty new version of Golden Tee, a juke box, a friendly guy slinging drinks, and most rewarding: a fully integrated theme of boomerangs. I wont be a spoiler, but you will love pointing out all the boomerangs, like its Highlights magazine. \n\nThey have domestic macros on tap, a full liquor selection and daily lunch and dinner specials. I'll probably go back for the Friday night fish fry.\n\nBottom line: don't let the fact that it is next to a strip joint and bumps up to a pretty questionable area chase you away. If you are a diver, dive in.
3 ||| This is the only pho place i go to when i'm in Vegas. \nIt can get packed during lunch and after club hours but you get seated pretty quick. The place is pretty big with lots of tables.\nTheir pho is good. There are many reviews about it below so...\nSince i always get pho, i wanted to try something different. I tried their hu tieu dac biet and it was not good. It was just couple pieces of meat, seafood, fish balls in soup loaded with msg that u can taste.\n\nBUT\ntheir bun bo hue is surprisingly delicious. I love the fact that it comes with so many veggies/herbs. Their broth isn't red like some places. You get the chile paste thing on the side to make it spicier and red. \nNext time i'm in Vegas, i will definitely get bun bo hue again.
1 ||| This place was so run down. The food was cold or warm. Flavor could have been nice to have. Drink station looks as if it has not been touched in years. Staff were not happy. Only one marked exit! A woman walked in covered with items for sale.... Really? Not sure how this placed passed any health inspection. No grade was was seen posted. Do NOT EAT HERE!
1 ||| This place is so old, I think Moses vacationed here after that whole ordeal with the flood.  \n\nThe prices really ought to reflect the level of resort your staying at - $250 a night? Please.  Unless you have children that you're taking to the water park, I really don't see a reason to stay here with so many other options in the valley.  The staff was friendly.  The food was ridiculously overpriced for the quality.  The water park gets 5 stars though.
3 ||| an old favorite. love to come here, not necessarily for the food which is ok, but it is a great place to hang out and enjoy your meal with friends. the staff always smiles.
1 ||| I live close to the Shiloh and I think I will become more of a fan as they work out some of the kinks.  So far the food has been enjoyable (buffalo chicken dip?  yes, please) as well as the atmosphere.  Having gone to their sister restaurant in Shadyside, I was really happy to see the Shiloh open again.  \n\nMy only complaint is one which will be ironed out in time: the wait staff is still trying to adjust.  For example, the waitress we had when we ate there took quite some time to come back to us to refill beers and waters.  It wasn't busy so I was a little upset about that.  When I went for drinks one night, they only had one bartender and a barback that was not old enough to back-up the bartender when they got busy.
1 ||| Honestly, coming from Los Angeles, I was disappointed by the lack Chinese food options in the area, but  Baoding is a good consistent lunch stop. They have a very easy menu with your standard fare, they are quick and the staff is nice enough. I wouldn't recommend it for dinner, but it is a great lunch standard. The place is a bit small for big groups though.
2 ||| 1) check in ok, love the layout of hotel\n   price was high for what you get\n    what's a \"bed tax\"?  now we have to pay to sleep?\n   nice lobby with sunken 'living room' and fireplace\n   free coffee in the a.m.\n   free paper in the a.m. \n\n2) Room - dark, old, stuffy\n     entrance light so dim you can't see in the closet.\n    closet space is angled, maybe take some bathroom space and make closet bigger?\n     bathroom big and if you like chips while taking a shower or bath, look up and peel one off the ceiling (I wonder how much lead is in it\n      room was with a pool view and if you like to sleep with the window cracked open a bit at night - ask before going if there are many families booked, the kids will be at the pool until midnight and up at 7am, or running down the halls yelling or throwing rocks at each other! \n   \n3) Housekeeping staff were pleasant and working hard.  \n   \n4) restaurant staff- 1/2 were oblivious, 1/2 was excellent!\n    expensive for dinner; wine list extensive but not in stock except the house wine\n   breakfast buffet- dirty counters and plates, over crisp bacon that turned into bits, waffle station disasterous and messy (no one came by to clean up the mess), bring a sweatshirt or sweater, they have the a/c turned up, eggs are the powdered kind\n\nCooks and some of the staff looked burnt out like the bacon bits!\n\nThere's definitely a 'fiesta inn' your belly after eating breakfast!
3 ||| One of the nicer hotels in Madison (and priced as such) with large rooms and super friendly staff.  I visit Madison 4-6 times a year and have stayed at the Hilton before but not in the past 5 years.  I must say I was suitably impressed by their staff from the valet to the front desk staff - all were efficient, and Mr. Rogers friendly and helpful which was much appreciated after the 5-hour drive from Minneapolis.\n\nI had a great room on the 10th floor that looked out over the lake. Nice view.\n\nSince we visited on Homecoming Weekend the place was hopping but that didn't deter their smiles and service attitude (although the parking was full when we arrived but the valet took care of us without a charge).\n\nThe location is great, just a couple of blocks off the capital square which makes it easy to visit our other Madison favorite, the Farmer's market that runs each Saturday from about May until October.  Having a fridge in the room was nice so we could keep all the cheese we bought fresh for the drive home to Minneapolis.
2 ||| pad thai = chow mein, the chicken dishes are bland. \nIf you're going to get something get the stir fries.
2 ||| I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\n\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\n\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\n\nUpshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.
1 ||| This review is a bit biased because the only reason I walked in here was because I had a gift card. This store really isn't my thing: it's way too upscale and expensive, and it's just not really my taste. However, even I was able to find a few items that fit my style and what I wanted, and I didn't have the spenders guilt about the price tag because I had the gift card. The staff were very nice and helpful. Though I liked the shirt that I bought, I will probably not shop here again (unless someone gives me another gift card).
4 ||| Mike Brawley is the beer/wine expert of south Charlotte. I like to play a game where I say what I'm looking for - hoppy/smooth/lite or dark/dry/nutty - and he makes a perfect recommendation. \n\nI'm fairly tough on customer service. He's excellent every time.
1 ||| If you connect in Charlotte expect constant delays!!!!!   Every time I connect through to Dulles I experience planes with mechanical delays
1 ||| I went to this practice after experiencing moderate to severe pain in my right ankle. When I made the appointment I told the person booking the appointment that it was related to my ankle (so they would hopefully assign me to a physician that was versed in that area).  When I went for my appointment, however, I was told by the doctor who saw me that she was not an ankle specialist, and could I come back later that same day to see someone who was.  As inconvenient as it was to do that (having to take time off work, twice in the same day), I went back. This new doctor, the \"ankle specialist\" examined me and basically said he wasn't  \"exactly sure\" what was wrong, could be one of any number of things, but he shot my ankle with cortisone in an effort to alleviate the pain. That relief lasted for two days, at which time I went to another practice (recommended by a co-worker) and took my x-rays from Carmel Foot Specialists. The new doctor told me that the x-rays were of \"such poor quality\" that there was no way anyone could make a diagnosis from them, adding \"it's typical for podiatrists to utilize poor imaging equipment\". The new doctor scheduled an MRI based on his exam and my symptoms, and I now have a diagnosis and a treatment plan--something that Carmel Foot Specialists was not able to provide, even after two separate visits, yet billed me over $500. What a waste of time.
0 ||| Came here with my cousin who was visiting from Fort Bragg because I had heard solid reviews from others. He got the Mahi Mahi tacos which he said were average. The fish was bland and not particularly anything to write home about.\n\nI had the chicken tacos which were so watery that the tortilla they came on was soggy, damp and crumbling apart before it even reached my table. That should've been my first sign.\n\nThere must have been an entire handful of chives in the tacos. I ended up having to spend five minutes picking enough out so I could actually taste the meat.\n\nAnyway, I ate a good portion of the tacos and began feeling sick about 45 minutes later. Spent the next two days in bed feeling miserable.\n\nI will never go back here.
4 ||| It's a really nice Teeter I will say it always seems to be under stocked whenever I go there. But that could be just the day I go is before there truck is in. Staff is friendly and the place is kept clean!
2 ||| My friend's English department had a small get together here.  Pretty awkward setting of religion with drinking.  It sorta is strange but get over it.  They ripped out the pews but kept some of the chapel windows, etc.  It's not easy to find and my friend circled around until he actually found the church.  Not too well in marking the brewery and need better signage.  Food was average and beer was okay.  Go there for the weird factor and less on the food and drinks.
1 ||| This store makes me crazy. OK, call me a grinch -- What beef could I possibly have with a place where happy kiddies and can make their own cute little stuffed animal friend?\n\nWell, since you asked: the throngs of people stuffed into a space the size of a bathroom stall. The rampant consumerism and ridiculously high prices. The fact that the entire \"build\" concept takes about 30 seconds of a machine blowing stuffing into a pre-fabbed bear body. The rest (chooing the outfits, accessories, etc.) can be done with just anout ANY stuffed animal or doll. And then there's all of those kids screaming. I don't DO screaming. The 2 stars are for those poor friendly folks doomed to working here. \n\nI start twitching just walking by the place. Baiscally, for me, build a bear equals hell on earth.\n\nStill, LOTS of people LOVE Build-a-Bear. Your mileage may vary. But just don't say I didn't warn you.
0 ||| We called Yellow Cab for a cab and were told it would be 15-35 minutes. We called after 30 minutes to check the status and were told it would just be a \"few more minutes\". After waiting a total of 50 minutes, we called again and were told they were having trouble dispatching a cab because we were kind of far... so after 50 minutes, there wasn't a cab even on the way!!!! Never using Yellow Cab again.
1 ||| It was good but parking sucks and the chicken looked pink and I asked if it was ok to eat and they said that's just the way the chicken looks. So we will see if I get sick. Also they had problems with their soda machine.
0 ||| I was not very impressed with this place.  Walked in and immediately felt like I was working in a waste water treatment plant.  I cannot believe the employees can take the smell.  Had to go outside after getting a beer to make it work.  If they clean this place up, it would be pretty cool.  Good luck!
0 ||| Run away, run far far away.  Not sure about purchasing with them but went in for service and had the worst customer service treatment I've ever received.  My car was returned with several new scratches and the service manager basically confirmed that they didn't believe me and wouldn't do anything to fix the problem.
1 ||| This safeways carries all the usual staples.  Nothing outstanding there.  The major fault I find is that it carries only lower end stuff in it's deli.  I stropped by once and asked for their top brand salami soprsata and the woman said they not only didn't have it, she'd never even heard of it.  \nAnother incident that shouldn't have happened was in the bakery.  I asked the difference between two kinds of breads with \"meant to impress\" names and the baker couldn't tell me.  Her answer was that the difference was in ingredients.  Well, no kidding!\nI usually go to the Safeway on Glendale for Safeway specific items that I want now.\nSpeaking of bakery.  Last time I was in there the rolls (not bulk) were scattered around in the different bins.  Some look like they'd been torn from their sister rolls from the bakery instead of cut.  Consequently, one roll has a large shard of bread attached to it and the other is short that amount.\nWonder about the sanitation also when customers are allowed to fondle the bread and then put it back in the wrong bins.  I don't see that as Safeways problem but a problem perhaps of the quality of customers who enter the store.
2 ||| Do Not give them your Money!  They make it seem like they will care about you and help you. They Don't! If you are unsatisfied, They don't care. I wrote Mike, the accounting Dept, and my coach and explained to them that I could no longer afford to eat because of his payments and that I needed to stop the coaching for a while till at least after my baby was born. I had been in the program for 4-5 months with no improvement or help from them. Be fair warned you will be paying $500 dollars an hour for them to check up on your transactions. A coach will call for thirty minutes a week. You will receive no support or  training, at least I didn't. I was told just study the scripts and make calls.   I asked to be released from the program and Mike Ferry personally wrote me and I quote \"You can fulfill the contract by being on the coaching calls ... making the payments ... doing what thousands of other Realtors do with our coaching and succeed at a high level ... or you can choose to fight me which quite honesty you won't win. You'll multiply your problems if you choose to go that route, because then I will take legal action against you for doing that. You made the choice and, as they say, you've made your bed ... now you have to sleep in it.\"  Not exactly what I was expecting. Thanks for caring Mike. If anyone has any questions about my experience please feel free to call 505-603-2435. Leland ... PS. just got a copy of my \"signed contract\"  back from the MFO which was funny because I never signed anything with them, I could not believe my eyes! Someone had actually signed the contract and it was definitely NOT ME!
2 ||| My main course of the tortellini was delicious, that being said, everything else was bad. I think it was because they did not seem to want our large party if 11, that on multiple times they let us know was an inconvenience (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), and when our napkins were mildew smellingand we politely asked for new ones, they treated us like we were rude, smelling the napkin and saying the entire bag came back from the laundry like this (hello, why would you out them on thetable then!) We also asked for new glasses because the store the napkins in the glasses. It was just horrible after that. The bread I was excited about was cold, wrong meals and drinks were brought with no apology. There was a good 30 minutes we saw noone, and we went through 4 different waiters. \nThey over charged the gratuity and when we showed them the math they denied it only after asking for the manager they wrote in a new price. I will never go back. Even after all that we were standing out front at the benches saying our goodbyes when 2 different waiters came out and walked around the group. They seemed like they were trying to get us leave but I can't be positive.
3 ||| I wanted to like it.... but after $20 for two sundaes and a rip-roaring case of heartburn, I'll pass. Gah!
0 ||| My family and I stayed here in March 2014, unfortunately I waited last minute to book a hotel for an event we were attending and this was our only choice. It was way over priced for the condition of the room and area. The carpet was filthy,  the comforter had cigarette burns in it, and I felt unconfortable and unsafe the whole time we were there. \n When we arrived it appeared someone was moving out, at first we thought we were at the wrong place because this place looks like a rundown apartment building. And yes these people lived there because they moved a whole uhaul truck out and did it all night long. The place is full of druggies as well,  we found some guy looking in every car window checking for unlocked doors and when my husband confronted him he said he was just looking for a cigarette,  then told my husband to have a nice day, ha. This guy was so high and hung around the hotel all day.\n The guyat the front was nice and helpful, but that would be the only good thing about this place. \n Definitely don't stay here especially with children.
2 ||| I have been playing Valley courses for 20+ years and Aguila since it opened 10+ years ago.  As someone that used to sleep in a car to play Papago and get to Agula by 4:00 AM to get a ticket I know what it's like to be a die-hard golfer.  As I'm now a father of 2 and don't feel like spending that much time to actually get a tee time I play around 8:00 now most weekends.  The past few times I played the Aguila 18 took more than 4 and a half hours.  I'm a fast player and waiting on EVERY shot isn't my idea of a fun round.  There wasn't a ranger any of these times.  The last ranger I encountered there waa an idiot anyways.  We ended up with a 5-some ahead of us holding us up every hole.  When I saw him on 10 tee and told him about it he joked and said \"oh those guys do that all the time\".  I asked that one of them be removed from the course but his solution was to split them into a 2-some and 3-some.  Oh yeah make 2 groups out of 1.  Real intelligent and a great way to speed things up.  So, while I truly love the women that work there and they have treated me as a friend for many years, I will not play there again and will gladly pay more to play elsewhere. \nI guess if you have 1/2 day to kill playing in 100+ heat you may enjoy the layout but the greens are slower than death.  I'm sure you will have time to notice that.

4 ||| For Wisconsin, this is about the best you are going to get for Chinese Food.\n\nSorry, you live in Wisconsin.\n\nBut the food is very good.  Huge servings, enormous shrimps, chicken that is tender, fresh rice.\n\nDon't complain Cheeseheads, this is good as it gets for Chinese in Wisconsin.
0 ||| My husband and I tried Nando's based on a recommendation from a friend. We arrived and there was no hostess to greet us. We just stood there looking around trying to make eye contact with anyone who worked there. After 5 minutes, the hostess appears and seats us. No apologies, just seats us. She tossed the menus on the top of the plates. Now we all know how disease-laden all restaurant menus are. That move totally freaked me out. Needless to say, we didn't eat off those plates. \n\nThe waiter comes and takes our order. He was polite and friendly. We get a tiny bowl filled with a massive amount of chips dropped on our table with the worst fake salsa/hot sauce in the world. I say fake because there is nothing in this concoction that resembles salsa. Bland, bland, bland. Our meals arrive and I will admit their rice was delicious. I had the #3 (chicken taco, cheese enchilada, rice & beans). The cheese enchilada had so much cheese that I could feel my arteries harden with every bite. I like cheese - a lot of cheese - but this was overkill. The enchilada sauce was O K. No zing to it. The chicken taco was extremely average - bland. My husband had the pork chops. They were thick with bone-in. One of them was drastically under cooked. My husband commented on the total lack of flavor. He was surprised there was no spice - just bland. \n\nNow I was born & raised in AZ and I am 1/2 Hispanic. So perhaps my Mexican food grading scale is higher then most people's. I expect flavor and a little kick to all Mexican food. This place is BLAND. We will never go back. Notice to all Mexican restaurants - Mexican food SHOULD have flavor and spice with an option to make it fire hot. As for the friend that suggested Nando's - we are re-thinking the friendship!!!  :o)
2 ||| From the outside it's a bit sketchy. Inside it's dark and mysterious. The Artisan is one of those places that makes you think: \"Only in Vegas\" with the paintings and art on the walls, ceiling, and anywhere they could find a place for it. \n\nService has been hit or miss here, and the after hours club scene is not all that it's hyped up to be. Sorry, I'm just not impressed. I've seen the naked pool. Yawn. Go upstairs and forget about the pool. The rooms have some cool looking art, but to be honest when I've been in the rooms I wasn't paying close attention to details to be able to write an in-depth review of them. \n\nIn short this review is going to mainly reflect I've been there several times and having avoided many of the amenities that people claim to go there for I've enjoyed the experiences immensely. Two things to watch out for. 1: Drink pricing is ridiculous if you check out the bar. 2: Use the valet as self parking will have you worrying about your car vs. enjoying why you came here. \n\nI know...the review's a bit cryptic but a few of you will have the all knowing smile and that's what counts.
3 ||| I went to an event  hosted at Hotel San Carlos and found the appetizers tasty, nothing special but basic.  The drinks were made well, the room was clean and relaxing, the service was nice and personable.  I think it is a great spot in downtown Phoenix for a social party/gathering!  \n\nI have never stayed in the hotel, so this review is strictly in the event category.  \n\nHotel San Carlos, has great charm and attentive employees.
1 ||| Went here this evening for dinner. My wife and I were seated quickly, our server greeted us quick. First off our chip basket was overly greasy. We asked for a different bowl, the second was fine. Are server was very nice. I ordered the shrimp fajitas, we got our food in record time. I was ok with 2 torilla shells, 3 would be better. The green peppers were under cooked, I didn't mind, because I don't eat them. The shrimp were on the small side. Over all for 35 dollars, that was 2 dinners, and 2 soft drinks. I would expect a little more. We may go back, naw I think not.
1 ||| We went for a business lunch and were not drinking. It's not a great experience when you're not drinking. :-/
3 ||| The staff isn't always the most knowledgeable, but I don't expect them to be experts at retail wages. They're friendly, and generally do their best to help, which is all I can ask for. My male and I stop in here more often then I would like to. They have the best selection electronics, at least unless I want to drive all the way to Frys. Higher end keyboards, mice, headphones, cell phone cases, this is the place to go. \nThe store is clean and pretty easy to get around. I especially love the cell section. They have all the main phones from all the major brands, and a number of prepaids as well to look at, and of course, the huge selection of accessories. \nThe only downfall to Best Buy is the prices. If they could be just a little more competive with online prices, they'd be my main spot for electronics, in stead of that,\"Oh crap, my keyboard just died\" place.
1 ||| Not really a friendly \"customer service\" oriented type of gym.  Not responsive to members requests.   Front desk is grumpy and doesn't bother to look up when you walk in.  Too busy doing their nails, homework, or talking.   Seems to be a control issue with the bike class passes too.   Not so sure I can recommend this gym to anyone.
4 ||| Went on a Saturday night.  Had reservations and was given the option of outside seating or indoor.  Very accommodating.  Recommends the cheese plate.  Great service and atmosphere.
2 ||| ::::::\n      ::::::\n            ::::::      \nWe looked at our entertainment book for pizza coupons and came across Domino's in some cruel twist of fate.  Since we hadn't had Domino's in easily 10 years and it was a pretty good coupon we decided in what later seemed a momentary lapse in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot.\n\nIt will likely be at least 10 years before we try them again.\n\nPizza that was on a par with those frozen ones from the grocery store and a free sandwich we shared that left us with tummy aches.\n\nDespite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food.
3 ||| This is a Charlotte classic.  Only order off the right side of the menu, as the left side is for those who are clearly lost... Burgers, Fries, Hot Dogs, and beer. \n\nEnjoy the fact that bankers can rub elbows with bikers here, watch the game on that one tiny television, and marvel at the excellent operation these guys run.\n\nI love the waitresses and the food.  Once monthly maximum, otherwise, I'd have to run there and back to maintain my health.
3 ||| The food was nothing more than mediocre for the price. Mediocre ribs (on the dry side), ginormous portions, and big prices to match. Tastes like a chain! And you pay for the theme.\n\nCan be decent for a gathering of the masses to watch a game, or a large party. Otherwise, I'd pass.
3 ||| Hems...\n\nWill always like this place because of so many great memories there.\n\nThey have pretty decent food and a good selection of beers for a college bar.  Prices are very good but can get extreamly crowded at night and on weekends.
0 ||| If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. \n\nLived here for two years. The first year was ok but the apartment and appliances need updating. AC doesn't work well and the door handles are terrible. Doors are thin and get holes easily. \n\nThis place is leased and some units are owned and rented. During the second year we noticed that the quality of people in the complex was declining. There was a lot of noise, drugs, and the place was filthy. No one cleaned up after there dogs, trash was everywhere, and I saw a lot of broken windows in the complex. \nBecause some units are owned and foreclosed, if the fire alarm batteries die and the alarm beeps, you can hear it all night. The office refuses to help. The alarm down stairs from us beeped for a week. It was awful....they said they couldn't do anything and when we asked to move they said we would have to pay. \n\nThe people in the office are rude and condescending. They don't want to help you and don't respond to issues. \n\nA police and swat team came up our stairs to \"question\" the guy living across from us. Lights were always out and I would have to walk from my car to the apartment in the dark with alll kinds of teenagers lurking around, smoking and drinking. \n\nI will say that the maintenance staff here was always great. Polite, respectful and fast. Loved them! \n\nOverall a terrible place to live. WOuld not recommend.
0 ||| Horrible, Horrible Horrible..\n\nIm from california, drove all the way out here to find out why my grandfather was rushed to emargency, and didnt find out until 2 hours after doctors and nurses passed by me.  \n\nThis place is the Martin Luther King hospital from L.A,\n\nIn l.a. we call it \"killa-King\" because not too many patients make it out
3 ||| Oh sh***#!! --It's Christmas Eve at 7:27pm and my brother and I still haven't decided where we're going out for dinner... We've been debating what kind of food, how fancy etc for 45 minutes. I'm picky and have diet restrictions. He loves meat which I don't so much. The kids are just flat out hungry! He's local and I'm not, so finally I just ask him to pick a good Mexican food restaurant. He calls Manuel's and they tell him they're only seating till 8pm. Let's go!\n\nWe arrive at 7:50 and the hostess immediately says \"we're not seating anymore.\" I reply that we just called and were told they seat till 8, and that's why we came. After she goes in back, our party of 5 was seated --5 minutes after we arrived. \n\nThe food was not bad, but it was a bit expensive for what we got. I had vegetable fajitas with shrimp added which put mine around $15. The fajitas were good and came with whole pintos which had great flavor but were a bit crunchy. The regular salsa was sweet, and the hot was all pepper. Wallace gets them three stars: he was professional and patient (\"up to a point\" as he told me). When we arrived every seat except ours was full. When we finished at 8:45, we were the only ones there. Before Wallace brought the check he even asked if I wanted another beer or if we wanted dessert! That's saying a lot on Christmas Eve. I'd definitely give them another try.
0 ||| PUBLIC alert!!!  Please read...\nWhen i crave for Chinese food i always go Cheng's.  I dont know how many time they changed management, i wanted to share with my horrible experience.  I ordered catering for my guests for a total of $200+, this was done over the phone.  Listen to this, Carol the owner took my order and asked for my full name, address, card number, expiration including the security code. April 29 my food was delivered. The delivery guy asked to see my debit card and ID. He did this manually by tracing my card so it will reflect  on the credit card form. He was very nice and gave him a tip of $20.  He has all my information. Next day i checked my bank statement online and there was these UNAUTHORIZED transactions totaling to $500+.  First thing that came into my mind is Cheng's involved, either that delivery kid or anyone from cheng's...they have all my card info, who else could it be.  As of today, im still debating that with my bank!\nPlease donot buy food here anymore if you are paying by card...food is not that good anymore!!!! Oh, thanks for the donuts, thats the only one that is good.
3 ||| I would consider Stool Pigeons a sports bar, with a large crowd cheering away on gameday (along with apparently being Ohio State's game viewing bar of choice). There are plenty of tvs throughout, along with a couple in need of replacement on the outside patio. The inside viewing is pretty easy from anywhere in the bar, but finding a seat can prove to be difficult. \n\nThe bar area lines one side of the place so there are plenty of spaces to work your way up to the bar to order. The beer selection on tap is extensive & they have a very good selection of higher end beers (Red Oak, Blue Moon, etc.) \n\nI've really only experienced the nightlife here, so I can't really critique the food other than saying the finger food I've snacked on is pretty tasty. The chicken quesadillas were good, but I'm anything probably would have tasted great at the time. Other than that, I haven't experienced much in the food department but the place is always packed with people eating away, so that has to be a good sign for the taste aspect.\n\nStool Pigeons is a good place to watch a game, with a loud crowd cheering away after every play, to the abundance of good viewing angles & tvs. The atmosphere is pretty live during the nightlife, & make sure you check out their unique fans along the bar, which I'd probably butcher trying to explain.
4 ||| This was delicious. I got the vegetarian enchiladas and tacos. It came with a side of fresh smashed potatoes (never had this as a Mexican place but i was craving it).\n\nThe water was delicious and fresh, the decor of the restaurant was phenomenal, and the service was good (not over the top, but nothing to complain about).\n\nPrices were very reasonable. I would visit again and take friends.
0 ||| I had The Mrs. Cleaver Pot Roast. And I must say if Ward, Wally and the Beav had to eat that shit every night the Cleaver's would have been the first divorced couple on TV.\n\nThe Pot Roast was smothered in gravy and tasted awful. This was a one bite episode then ask for the check and leave type of experience.
4 ||| Great place for a happy hour glass of wine.  Outside seating has a nice view of the lake.  The pizza shop next door will deliver to your table.
4 ||| I've been to many airports in my time and would have to say this is my home and favorite. It really embodies the beauty of Arizona. Plus all the new favorite local restaurants are plugged in here LoLo's, Jose Cuervo Restaurant (my fav) and  more. Thanks guys, I always look forward coming home. Cheers!
0 ||| STAY AWAY FROM ARCADIA COVE!! \nThey won't give the deposit back. Even though I have cleaned everything, they said simple reasons to keep the deposit with them. DO NOT STAY IN ARCADIA COVE, you will loose all your security deposit.
1 ||| I've tried this place 3 times and I give up.  \n\nMajor issues:  \n\n1.  Noise.  This is the loudest grooming facility I've ever seen.  I don't know how the employees put up with it.  Perhaps it is the narrow structure of the rented space itself.\n\n2.  Communication issues - my pet will be ready when?  I show up at the specified time, and not ready.  I'm told I will be called.  I wait, and wait, and wait.... and finally call back to find out that my pet has been ready for quite some time and they're wondering why I didn't pick him up sooner since I was so impatient.\n\n3.  Some staff don't have a full deck.  I should be cautious here, because maybe she has a disability, but the person who seems to always take my pet and money isn't \"with it\".  Someone spaced out isn't exactly the sort of person you want handling your pet.
3 ||| Love Rosati's pizza. You wouldn't know it, but apparently there are two almost identical Rosati's chains in the Valley. The story is that the cousins of the original Chicago owners licensed the name to franchisees a few years back (myrosatis.com). This location is part of the original chain brought to the Phoenix area more than 20 years ago (rosatispizza.com). But enough with the history. The pizza is outstanding for take out. The thin crust is, yes, wafer thin and the Italian sausage is in big chunks as opposed to the rabbit pellets of other national joints. The stuffed pizza is a cheese-drenched meal in one slice. Sweet, chunky sauce with a bit of tang to it. But, what impressed me most about this specific place was the customer service. When I arrived to pick up my phone-in order, I was told it wasn't ready yet. They had made a mistake and were baking me a new pie. The manager was very apologetic and handed me a few cans of soda for my trouble. Sure, it was a small gesture on his part but now I know where I'm going the next time I'm hungry for some 'za.
3 ||| First and Foremost, If you don't like oily foods, don't eat filipino food. cuz usually when you go to  Filipino restaurants, chances are, atleast one or two of their dishes are more than likely to clog your arteries. Im a fan, of pinoy pinay, because they get it right. It's authentic, its pretty much real filipino food. I just don't like the fact during the slow hours of 3-6pm, they leave the food sitting out, and it looks dry. I don't know maybe there trying to save money by cutting back on food costs. I also don't like the fact that they don't have Longanisa every day. but then again, its really unhealthy, so maybe that's why. my personal favorites, are pork bbq on a stick, pancit bihon, beef caldereta and once in while lechon kawali. the sinigang soup is pretty good also.
0 ||| I ordered the $11.99 Sashimi lunch today and was really disappointed with what I got. It's supposed to come with 12 pieces of sashimi, but the problem is that most of it was what I'd consider 1/2 size pieces, really tiny. It came with miso soup which was nice and hot, but no rice? I think this is the first time I've ordered a sashimi meal and didn't get rice to go with it. \n\nThe single piece of salmon was very lean (no fat) missing that lovely creamy taste that I enjoy so much. And I don't remember any yellow tail on there at all. \n\nMaybe the other lunch specials are better, but this deal was horrible. Left hungry and felt cheated by the small portion size.
0 ||| This is the worst Chipotle location I've ever been to. They don't hold up to the standards set by Chipotle at all.  \n\n-People here move at a snail's pace. Im not saying they need to rush, but the way everything is set up should make for a smooth and quick experience.\n\n- If you tell them what you want they can only remember one thing you said. Example: \"Pico and hot salsa.\" Then they just put Pico on and look at you. \"Sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.\" Puts spur cream on and just looks at you. \n\n- Ordered tacos to go, when I get home with them, 5 minutes later, I have a pile of sour cream all over my \"tacos\" which now resemble a casserole of some sort. I can't even figure out where one taco begins or ends. So appetizing for $8. \n\nIf I wanted crap I would go to Taco Bell. At least there a taco still looks like a taco and they keep the contents inside the tortilla.
4 ||| Cargo is ideal -- their staff is super friendly, their coffee is excellent, and the food is healthy and inexpensive. Its just down the street from my office, so I go there regularly, and have had nothing but good experiences with the service or the product.
0 ||| We've never eaten breakfast or lunch here, and given the multiple bad reviews regarding wedding cakes, I'd never order one here.  Thank goodness I'm not in the market for a wedding cake!  I was however, in the market for a custom birthday cake so I did end up ordering one from here.  The lady who took my order was kind of standoffish, so I really had to turn up the charm to warm her up.  Once we got past that awkwardness she was much less caustic, and we even ended up buying goodies from the case after ordering the cake.  \n\nFast forward one week when we came to pick up the cake, and they had it ready and waiting for us at the time we specified.  When a different lady brought the cake out, it was in a box, so we only saw the top of it, and we mistakenly took that at face value.  Our error was not checking the writing we had ordered that went on the side of the cake as opposed to the traditional top side.  When we got home we realized the birthday cake had the recipient's name spelled wrong.  Yikes!  \n\nWe jokingly played off the spelling error, because we just didn't have time to take it back and ask that it be fixed.  Though, I wonder what their response would have been. \n\nThe taste of the cake was average.  No one seemed incredibly amazed by it.  I'm not entirely sure I would get another one from here again.
4 ||| My friend fedex'd me two pizzas to Seattle.  I was amazed to find they tasted just as good as when they come right out of the oven at the pizza shop!
3 ||| i like the dirtiness and \"different\" staff (not to mention the proximity) of the fry's near me, but if i need something coming back from the dog park, i'll stop here. it's much cleaner and nicer than the fry's but this place always makes me feel inferior...maybe it's the hummers and beemers in the parking lot, maybe it's the over cologned/perfumed scottsdale type shopping in their designer workout clothing....maybe i just like going to a scottsdale store in the my pickup wearing the junkiest clothes i have, that stink, and are stained with paint and caulk....\nthey do have an awesome flower section though, so when i need to sweet talk my lady, i always get my flowers from here....
2 ||| With $1.00, I can either get 4 gum balls from the gum ball machine at the mall, or choose an item from the plethora found on Wendy's value menu.  I rarely choose the gum balls.  I give Wendy's 5 stars because in my opinion it is everything you could ask for in a fast food joint: Value, friendliness, and most importantly, speed.  I like to play a game called 'How many seconds from the time I finish placing my order until the time I have my order in hand and am driving away?'.  Today it was 24 seconds - now that's fast food!  They are so quick when taking the order, charging at the first window, and delivering your food to you at the second.  And that was around the time of the lunch hour rush.  My favorite game, however, is called 'Don't come to a complete stop when picking up my food'.  Since they usually have my order hanging out the window before I even get there, I can just roll right through, grab my food while still in motion, and be on my way (With a \"Thank you\" of course).  This location usually has hot girls working there too.  Did I mention that the girls at both windows said \"have a good day!\"?.  Well now I did.  In fact, the second one even asked me how I was doing, and while I know their bosses tell them to say those things, my friends at Wendy's almost always sound more genuine than at other places. Many times I get the mandarin chicken salad, which is amazing, but today I got a jr bacon cheeseburger, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a frosty.   I never expect gourmet from Wendy's, especially from the dollar menu, but it's good food and definitely worth it, especially the decadent frosty.  The only complaint I would have is that the first-window girl was not hot like the second-window girl.
0 ||| Can I give a Place no Stars , because that is what this place deserves, they suck NEVER NEVER NEVER go here. I got my A/C fixed and paid 1300 to replace my entire A/C components on my truck in july 2008. In less than a year later, It's broke again (April 2009). They said it was a valve that went out which they replaced. So, they replace that for free. Now, less than a year later again after April 2009 that it's broke in March 2010.  It does not work again. In less than 2 year period, my ac on my truck has broke twice since I got it all replaced. They want to charge me to get it fixed now that the 12 month warranty is over. To top it off they retro fitted my High pressure line with the wrong valve and told me they could not fix that and admitted to putting the wrong valve on it. So, I could not fill is up with Freon to see where it is leaking. I had to buy 60 dollars with of part at auto zone to fix it. It's ridiculous that I paid for my A/C on my truck to be replaced and it breaks every year.   This is about the Sun Devil Auto on Chandler Blvd, Cross Streets Chandler and McQueen but from what I have read on the internet they all SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3 ||| Employees are very friendly and my simple iced coffee order is always made to my liking.  I don't frequent this particular starbucks often though because I can never find an open parking space. They have some metered spots right out front but they are always taken when I'm needing my caffeine fix!  It is also a smaller store and there are not a lot of available outlets to plug in my laptop.  In fact, last time I went, I couldn't even find an outlet other than the one that was already being used.  The other down side is that it can get very busy during peak hours because all office buildings that are located nearby (and Johnson and Wales).\n\nAll in all, coffee is good but not my fav location due to parking, smaller venue, and lack of outlets for my little baby laptop!
3 ||| I have gone here only a few times, since I'm more of a fresh fruit smoothie with boba type of girl; but when I'm craving milk tea, this is the place to go. Everytime I'm here, I always get the honey milk green tea with boba. It's absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend it. Since I have never actually eaten here before, or even sat down (I always get my tea to go), I cannot vouch for their customer service. But I can say that they are definitely fast in getting my tea ready (then again, I always end up going when it's not busy). So I guess I could say that my rating for this place is really for the milk tea.
4 ||| I have been going to these places since 1994. It is a good place to get a stir fry that you select the ingredients. Very unique concept. Usually I end up with enough food for 3 meals. The staff will explain how to get the most food for the money.  Prices gave increased over the years but the quality remains the same.  Since they cook with water the calories are kept to a minimum.
4 ||| My wife and I come here all the time with our 6m old. The staff is fantastic and helpful. I highly recommend this place!
0 ||| Dump the new speakers- too much bass and very irratating.
3 ||| I'm always perplexed about coming to this restaurant. It's not like I don't know what the foods going to taste like, I know that I'll get unlimited soda [insert simulated gagging sounds here], I know the d\u00e9cor, and that mystical scent in the air. I suspect, that we always go back because of the service, really could there be any other reasons. OK, aside from the ribs, which I'm not sure if I've passed my phobia of touching my food. Yes, I said it, I said it on the Internet, I don't like touching my food. Anyhow, I suspect we always go back because of the service. The service? The service. For some reason, this restaurant gets it, from the front door to the kitchen and back again. It's strange and in all my years of observing these types of things, I would have never imagined it at Tony Roma's. Plus, we always have a good time laughing for some reason at the restaurant. Like the other night, where this overzealous waiter kept vacuuming the floor in the middle of dinner service using a busted battery powered vacuum. OK, so we asked him to stop twice, not once, twice. Are you kidding me? We made a joke about it when my friend ran out with one of the units pretending to vacuum, it was so funny and caused his brother to bolt from his chair ready to snag the unit from the person's hands not knowing it was his brother. Try Tony Roma's and you won't be disappointed, I really enjoy the soups and salads. Yes, I touch my food.
0 ||| Went in tonight for the Turkey dinner, and chicken fried steak. Chicken fried steak was \"soggy\", and tasted horrible. 2 Turkey dinners, and both dishes were served cold. The only thing somewhat edible, was the coleslaw, as it tastes fine when cold. To add to the experience, the Chicken Fired steak was served exactly how I asked it NOT to be, and the mashed potatoes for the 2 Turkey dinners never showed up. The waiter never refilled my Wife's drink, no checked to see if she needed a refill. I asked 3 different times for condiments for the sides, only to receive them after I asked the third time. The kitchen staff, and management are clearly over taxed on anything more than 10% occupancy. we couldn't count the number of people who were in line with complaints over their orders. I WILL NOT ever consider going to this place again.
0 ||| Fly another airline.  Best advise I can give!
3 ||| Omggg Pullano's, where do I even start? First of all, this place is crazy close to us, which is a huge bonus :) Ever since \"Daddy-O's\" (gag me) took over Casey Jones (such a sad day), we've been looking for a new cheap bar that has a good atmosphere.\n\nEnter: Pullano's! My boyfriend's brother told us about it and we finally went a couple of weeks ago... score!! We've been back twice since and, if we didn't keep ordering practically the entire menu and EATING IT ALL, we would go back more often...\n\nThe pizza? Awesome! Customize, order straight off the menu, whatever. Certain days they offer crazy specials on pizza (one special offers you a large pizza for free, if I recall correctly), so that's always worth looking into.\n\nGreat prices on pitchers of beer-- end of story. Get crunk (or watch your friends get crunk-- DDs are our friends!) on pitchers of beer from $9 (domestic) to $13.25 (seemingly everything else).\n\nThe servers are all young and very friendly, which is totally sweet. We've never had a mean or grumpy server-- huge plus. You may even get lucky and have one of the owners serve you, which is so cute, in my opinion.\n\nThursdays are the days to get wings (although I don't know if this changes...?? Call or check online). When we went (on a Thursday), wings were $.40 and, according to my boyfriend, really good.\n\nI'm personally a fan of the pizza (duh) and the happy hour prices for appetizers-- um, $4 for a GIANT plate of bruschetta? Yeah, sign me up!\n\nThe only \"downsides\", if you can call it that, is that the place is ALWAYS busy. We've gone on a Thursday night, a Saturday around 3 p.m, and a Friday around 8... not \"dead\" times but not exactly hopping... but Pullano's was BUSY. Be prepared to wait 5 min. more and have to maneuver around large parties (that inexplicably like to push their chairs into the aisle...)\n\nThe other thing is the menu--- holy crap. Be prepared to sit there for a solid 10 min. trying to understand it all if its your first time there. The menu is HUGE and the print is really tiny. I mean, I'm practically blind, so take that with a grain of salt, but still. It's tiny print. Just be warned.\n\nThat said-- don't go. This is my bar, y'all ;)
1 ||| I will start by saying great food and amazing salsa... However worst service and slowest wait staff I've ever encountered. It's not even busy in here. I ordered a beer literally 20 min ago and still haven't gotten it. Also the salsa is brought in a lil carafe and nothing to poor it in. Very odd and puts the patron in a difficult situation to figure out.
1 ||| Rip-off artists.\n\n I only used them cuz they were on my (cheaper) dental plan from Aetna. They make stuff up that's wrong that's kind of iffy, that any ethical dentist would say, no, you don't need a root canal, but if you needed anything, we would try to take out the filling and re-fill it first.  They try to sell you this stuff cuz the insurance makes no $ from the regular cleanings and they have to make some $ somehow, so they fabricate stuff that's not ready to be done yet on your teeth. AND, this dental assistant was very rude. indian woman. \n\nAlso, the other girl my son had--she was quite nice, but not too competent. she wrote the wrong info down about what work my son needed done! supposed to be teeth A & B, and ended up as 8 and 13 on their chart! so, when I went for a 2nd opinion back to our old dentist 45 min away, he said nothing wrong with 8 or 13! and when I called to let Southwest have it, the original dentist said it was mismarked on the chart and she said A & B.
0 ||| A big disappointment. Greens were aerated a few weeks ago and were in terrible shape. Had we been told about this, would have played elsewhere.  Course play management was non existent which slowed us down. Overall, a forgettable course. Much better places to play when in Las Vegas.
0 ||| Yaki Tacos were yucky! Skimpy on the teryaki and dry. The fries were hard and cold. Place is going down hill fast. I wont eat here again! WOOF!!
0 ||| Got some grapes here the other day and when I got home, I opened one container to discover that they were full of mold.  One of the packages was decent quality, but the other was inedible.   I think I'll make sure to open the package to check the freshness the next time I buy grapes from them.
3 ||| So this was a place that I actually wanted to visit and check out for the longest time but since you are in Vegas usually to party and there are so many other things to do, you don't normally have the time or ability to convince your party to go with you here. I got lucky since we needed shot glasses and cups for a room party that i convinced my friends to go here. First thing that I noticed was that there was two parts to this place with a General store on the right. There were security guards at the doors checking people out which gave it an unpleasant feeling. I was thinking who steals prank toys and souvenirs. I guess somebody does. They even had security walking around like it was art or something and people couldn't be trusted. The other problem I had with this place was that alot of it was the same exact stuff. T-shirts, shot glasses, pictures and so forth. The gags section was tiny too with maybe a small section for gags. I saw this place on Television on the travel channel talking about how it was suppose to be the biggest gift and gag store around and this was suppose to be the place to visit. Rarely have I had T.V lie to me but I believe they have. They had their famous robotic talking parrots but other than that everything was kinda of the same. You could definitely find more things inside of a Spencers store or online.
0 ||| Totally messed up my drink order after I waited for it forever.
3 ||| Love Vinnies on South Blvd and at the Lake! Both have great service and food. Especially enjoy the convenience of location on South Blvd
1 ||| I went in today to get a full set of gel nails, wanted them to look natural and simple with polish over the top. What I got was a really poorly done set that looks like it needs to be filled and it has only been 2 hours since I got them done. The gel and polish do not even cover the entire nail. I mention to the lady that it was gapping she kept saying no I wont notice or it will be okay. Also I kept saying I wanted them thin and natural, they look like really cheap acrylics. Very UNHAPPY! Need to find time to get these soaked off and find a place that can do a proper job.
3 ||| Such a great place, amazing inventory. Unfortunately, I've never bought anything because it's so expensive. But I do like to go and just look. :)
0 ||| Terrible service!!!!! My husband and I came in after he had just bought my wedding band about a week ago. I wanted it resized a size bigger so it would fit with my engagement ring. The woman helping us was extremely rude and told me the rings were the same size. Fine. But what I want is my wedding band a size bigger. I am the paying customer so I should receive what I'm asking for. She brought the ring over to the area where they fix rings and the man working that area was also extremely rude. They had terrible customer service. We will NEVER go back to Jared's! My husband also informed me the same lady brought him rings thousands of dollars over his budget when he was choosing the ring. Shows how extremely selfish these people are.
3 ||| I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.\n\nI give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.\n\nI think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.\n\nI'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here.
3 ||| People here are very helpful.  Usually not too busy to get right on a machine.  Classes here I hear are great but have yet to try one.  I go there to just workout and leave.  For this its great for me.  No pool here is my issue but there are other 24 hours that have this.... but this is close to my house.
4 ||| OK so this Christmas I decided to make things easy for myself in the cooking department, considering I just cooked a full on feast for Thanksgiving.\n\nI decided to have a Honeybaked ham for my Christmas dinner and I will make all of the delicious sides which would be simple!\n\nThe Ham was delicious, picked it up the day before Christmas, yes waited in a 40 minute line, I was expecting that so no shock, lol.\n\nIt was $38 bucks for a ham that fed 8 people a generous portion, I think it was a great deal for taste, price and convenience.\n\nYou don't even have to bake or heat it up, simply pull it out and let it rest for an hour and you are ready to go. That is key that you serve this ham at room temperature!\n\nI suggest making your own sides as they are costly and in my opinion their sides are not as good as what you can do on your own. They are called Honeybaked ham for a reason and that is what you should buy :)\n\nAll I had to do was my sides, green beans and bacon, brown sugar baked yams, and scalloped potatoes. It was an easy Holiday dinner and it left a lot more time for talking, snapping pics and laughing with family and friends!\n\nI will be doing a repeat of this next year for my Christmas dinner!!!\n\nI am a very happy customer!
2 ||| This place seems like an upscale Coco's.   Similar look, bake goods on display on the way in (muffins instead of pies), and a couple of items on menu same as Coco's (Sam Adams Beer Batter Fish n Chips).\n\nCompared with most Coco's in Phx area this place is cleaner, newer.   My problem was the food.   All four items we ordered were bad.  My kids got \"flatbread pizza\" and it was nasty, they could not eat it, slimy and falling apart.   My wife got some kinda pasta dish, they forgot the shrimp and brought out later, it was not good.  My french dip was pretty mediocre.
0 ||| Paid for some repair work here. After the problem continued I took it to another mechanic. I was informed that the spark plugs and air filter for the ac I paid to be replaced were never done. When I spoke with them regarding this issue they were very rude and aggressive.
0 ||| This place is just a dive...It is NOT a sports bar....Don't even bother going...It's awful..Let me also add, Saturday college football, and the 1 tv turned to golf...also, only 1 pool table..okay for a dive bar, understanding cheap drinks and all but, not a sports bar. Fun atmosphere for bikers and people that smoke weed. 2 girls smoking out back near the door...once again....not a sports bar....!!!
4 ||| I used to come here quite often and really enjoyed it. However, something happened and they really went down hill. I went there again about 3 weeks ago after not going there for years and it was really good. So we went there again this week. Again really good, the food has greatly improved!  Everything  once again was delicious and the service was fantastic.  I am so glad that they got it together again. They are only open for Breakfast and lunch. But, i love that they are right here in the neighborhood.
0 ||| If zero stars was an option this would be the place! Dirty floors, dirty counters, rude employees, broken equipment, slow service.  This McDonald's really sets the brand standard.  Just stay away unless you have a lot of time to wait and don't mind your food being touched without gloves right after they handle the money.
0 ||| Pei Wei is okay . I am not thrilled by Pei Wei much anymore. There food keeps me full , it's relatively healthy and everybody in the family can find something they like. But as far as earth shaking yummy..nope  ..not here. \nI like that I can get brown rice. I am pleased that I get veggies in my food. But the flavors are overdone and some seem sticky sweet. \n\nBTW , Pei Wei if you want customers to feel welcomed you might want to great them , and take their orders instead of sitting  and talking .  We waited for quite a bit while one hostess took phone orders and two other gals sat and talked .
4 ||| A family owned restaurant in the heart of Gilbert which gives back to the community through fundraisers and friendly service...  When you get to know the employees they become like family, two of the very best are Mike and Ben! \n\nThe food... Fantastic!  A great menu and really interesting specials.  Primarily this is a sandwich/pizza with in house freshly baked bread and wheat wraps however they take it a step further with bruschetta, mushroom Phylos and other good stuff!
0 ||| Your bakery department sucks big time. You charge ridiculous prices on your desserts that are made just not right. Well we tried almost every item, EASY ON A SUGAR GUYS, YOUR STUFF IS WAY TOOOOOO SWEET. \nWe love the rest of the store though, deli snd sushi are great. GL
1 ||| This place is inconsistent. Went there for a fish fry for the first time last weekend and it was excellent. The food was great and our waitress was so friendly too. It was so good we decided to go there again the next Friday. So we went back to eat there this last Friday and it was not good. We had a different waitress who clearly didn't want to be there and was not friendly.Our food was just ok. And the fish didn't seem very fresh, a lot of the meat was dark gray rather than white. It was kind of embarassing because brought guests the next time we went and had told them how great it was and clearly it wasn't good the next time we went. Unfortunately, I am not sure if we will return or not. Maybe we'll check out Quivey's Grove next time. I think consistency is really important in a restaurant.
0 ||| I have heard so many AMAZING things about this place and though I have tried this place over & over again. I cant seem to enjoy eating here at all.  \n\nEvery single time I have been brought here by friends who loved this restaurant, it has always been at least a 30-40minutes wait. Which I normally dont mind at all but waiting for something that I dont enjoy afterwards does not seem that it was worth waiting at all.\n\nI dont remember what I ate because I let my friends that has been here order for me but of all the plates I tasted nothing stood out and nothing blew me away. I, also finally tried the honey toast that A LOT of people rave about, but it highly disappointed me.  maybe is because i did not like the honey taste or the texture of the honey toast, but it didnt taste that great either. \n\nI guess Ichiza isnt for everyone.
1 ||| Shasta built my pool in 2006 with a raised spa.  The spa now leaks due to an internal Pipe leaking.  Contacted Shasta and they said it was not covered by their warranty, it only covers structural issues.  Shasta warranty is not that good, dont believe the hype about being a Shaster master pool.... all these pool builders use the same contractors and Shasta doesn't give any better support/warranty then the cheaper guys do.
1 ||| Based on the quick tip I posted: \"Check expiration dates :(\" You should be able to figure out why I don't love this store. \n\nIt used to be my regular grocery spot but they have really let things slide, lately. Recently, I was picking up some yogurt (the store brand bartlet pear is one of my favorite flavors!) and found most of what was on the shelf in the flavor I wanted to have expired. NOT GOOD. Especially since the nearby Fry's used to be scary but it's not any more. Not to mention there's a Fresh & Easy and an AJs across the street.\n\nCome on Safeway... don't relegate my business to watching for Coke products to be on sale!
0 ||| I told the employee I would like extra cheese 3 times and I ended up with double meat. I was the only customer in there and she seemed distracted. When I got home i took a bite and thr bread just crumbled into pieces. I will never return to this subway again.
3 ||| We have enjoyed mixteca on several occasions.  There is a bit of a line, but it is always worth the wait. Salsa bar and chips are awesome and I absolutely love their beef tacos.
3 ||| Me and my boyfriend traveled to Vegas for the first time last summer. Whatever city we are in we love to check out the local flavors (places the locals go, not the places deemed safe for tourist.)\n\n I can't quite remember how we found out about this spot bout we loved and and went there 3 times during the same vacation. \n\nThe catfish fingers are 2 snaps up in a circle!\nThe other patrons we met were cool.\nDrinks were a decent price.\nThere was live music (maybe not every night).\nAnd we still got to play our slots!
4 ||| Summary: Excellent food!!! The guacamole was made right there at the table. The service was wonderful. The Marriott cheese band was great. I would go again.\n\nMy family and I were traveling through North Carolina. We decided to stop and have dinner at a Mexican restaurant. This one popped up on yelp it looked like a good place to go so we tried it out.\n\nWe shared the tres alteca and a Texas fajitas. The food arrived hot and fast. It was way more than three people should eat, but we tried. It was excellent. For new people going I would definitely recommend the homemade guacamole and tres alteca.
0 ||| This place is just no bueno at all! No complimentary breakfast, no pool, wifi is $10 (free with rewards membership), pay for parking even as a guest. Waited over an hour for an \"engineer\" to bring me a pair of pliers to get my debit card out of their ATM. Save your money and go to a cheaper hotel that is more accommodating!!!
3 ||| Five stars simply because there are so few cool places in CLT! Nice little market where you can get knick knacks, some food, some drink. Little outdoor are between two buildings has a cozy, alley feel. You can crack open that beer out there, too. The writing all over the wall is kind of lame, but hey, these Charlotteans need all the outlets they can get in this buttoned up southern banking town.
1 ||| \"Food and ambience was great, but staff completely misinformed us about the price of the buffet; it was Way pricier than i thought...bad service\"
1 ||| Our family (7 people) stayed here in four rooms.  We loved our rooms and that they were located in small casitas and not a huge block hotel. The landscaping and grounds are absolutely beautiful.  We enjoyed just walking around the facilities.\n\nThe pool and hot tub was very relaxing, and when we were there it was very empty.  T. Cooks restaurant was extremely good and has been one of the best meals I've had in the Phoenix area. \n\nWe spent a day at the spa and enjoyed ourselves. The facilities are small and very pretty. We were asked to wait in the 'relaxation area' between treatments.  It was a lovely area with nice chairs, drinks etc... The very surprising thing was that it was basically the only place people could walk through, so it ended up being the least relaxing place. Every few minutes some one from the staff has to walk through the room to get from the treatment area to the front desk. Once someone even brought what looked like large laundry bags through.  It was a beautiful place and our treatments were great.  I just think the layout and timing of maintenance needs to be rethought.\n\nFrustrations: Check in and check out was slow.  The 'front desk' area is very quaint but too small when several people are needing attention at once.  Plan to wait a while if there is anyone else waiting.  The resort made several mistakes on our bill. They fixed it but only because we caught it. Also, when we came back to our room one afternoon our door was ajar.  We checked the room and nothing was missing.  We called resort security and they were able to trace back who last opened the door with their key card (a resort employee).  It was all ok, but we could have lost our jewelry or laptop if someone had decided to take advantage of the open door.\n\nI loved the food and beauty of the resort, but I don't think I'd stay here again because of the slow check in and out and the security problem.
2 ||| In a sea of pretty great restaurants, LaVecchias defines three stars for me. It's not a bad restaurant by any means, but it can sometimes pale in comparison to others in the area. If half stars were possible, I'd probably award LaVecchia's with 3.5/5.0. \n\nI've come here with a few different coupons, buy one get one (entree), free appetizer, special three course price, etc. Every time I show up with a coupon, the staff is more than accommodating - which is really refreshing. Hey, I appreciate that others understand I like to eat on the cheap-ish. \n\nOnto to the experience, while the staff has always been friendly and knowledgeable I abhor the setup and decorating. Sorry, but I do. The tables are really close together (especially the two-tops) and I can't stand the myriad of sea creatures floating on the walls. I know, I know, it has nothing to do with the food, but I think it looks chintzy. \n\nAs for the food, one particular meal I recall a very tasty and fresh salmon with a great glaze and delicious potatoes. An other time, however, I dove into a really salty shrimp dish that I could barely finish. So, we'll call it a net three. Will I come back? Sure, with a coupon in hand!
3 ||| I'm only giving this place three stars but I wish I could give it five. The food is amazing and very moderately priced...especially the honey hot bbq wings and pizzas (which we get everytime we come in). Last time we tried a cheesesteak and it was fantastic! Best I've had in a long time. The happy hour (5 dollars for a premium pitcher of blue moon or fat tire, or 4 dollar for domestic brews) cannot be beat anywhere in the valley. \n\nThe only thing about this place that is not up to our standards is the service.\n\nThe girls they hire here are inexperianced, slow and sometimes down right rude. Most of the servers we have experianced forget major parts of our order or forget about our table altogether. Once we were even told \"we better hurry up and finish because we are closing in 15 minutes.\" We had just gotten our food! My friend who was dining with us that night had frid zuchinni that she was in the process of eating and one of the servers literally grabbed it out of her hands and started boxing it up...while she was trying to eat! I've never experianced that level of ignorance and downright rudeness while dining out...ever. and I'm usually prety forgiving being in the restaurant industry myself. The girls just have no clue! \n\nThe food and great happy hour are sincerely the only things that keep us coming back again and again...although I wish it was an overall satisfaction.
2 ||| Went there Saturday November29, 2014. Entered establishment at 5:30 pm. PROS.....Very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it I've ever been served. Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit.
1 ||| Shopping at Desert Ridge and it was past lunchtime.   Despite there being only two or three tables occupied and several hours past standard lunch hours, it was a bit untidy.  A few littered tables, some bits on the floor, the salsa bar needed straightened. (Minus a point)  I was waited on at the counter by the manager, who greeted me with a big smile and was very pleasant and patient as I studied the menu.  As it was my first time, I decided to go for the Famous Fish Tacos plate.  They gave me my number, my pop cup, and I mosied over to the salsa bar and filled up some cups with different salsas to try before settling at a high-top by the window.  It wasn't long before another smiling counter-person brought out my order and checked to make sure I had everything I neeed.  Very nice level of service.\n\nThen things started going downhill.  The fish tacos---they  tasted very, very, VERY fishy.  In fact, I started to worry that maybe the fish had gone bad.  (Of course, I didn't think of that until I was halfway thru my second taco!  Eeeek!)  (Minus another point) Now the beans were very good---super tasty!---in fact, I should have gone with just a big plate of them!\n\nBut the killing blow---and so many eating establishments, both fast, casual and fine do this and I don't know why!!!!???---was as I started my meal, the manager started sweeping up around my table with a broom and dustpan as I ate.  As I said, the dining room was basically empty, she could have started anywhere else.  Better yet, she could have done something less dust-raising, like clean off the table tops or tidy the salsa bar or clean a bathroom or iron money or SOMETHING!  Do these people not realize what an absolute turn-off it is to be trying to eat and imagining dust from countless other diners wafting around your food?  Yuck!  So, MAJOR point reduction.\n\nWould I eat here again---maybe, maybe not.  There's quite a few quick eat places at Desert Ridge to try out and even though I didn't get sick, there was something not right about those fish tacos.  Or maybe that's just how they taste at Rubios---but I have had fish tacos before that have been delightful.  These were not.    And, like I said, it just irks me to be swept around when I am eating.  So, like I said, maybe...maybe not.
2 ||| I remember many years ago how much I loved going to Captain Bills. \nMy mom found this place and I loved the stickers and the subs were good. \nPlus i was cheap enough that my mom could afford it.\nI decided to bring my brother who lives out of town here even though i hadn't been in awhile, and I brought my three year old daughter. A mistake I will not make again. \nFirst off, there was no sourdough. Which there definitely used to be. \nMy sandwich was pretty bland, it tasted like bread and thats about it. Plain white bread. Yum! Glad I drove out of my way for it. \nThen, the most awesome part. My kid needed to use the bathroom, but oh wait....They don't have one that their customers can use. i was instructed to go ask the Mexican place across the street. Thats what I want to do! Pick up my three year old and drag her across the parking lot and pray that we make it in time. I won't be coming back. The once funny stickers it seems are only updated with political crap instead of general humor, the once great subs are bland, their service varies depending on which high school student you end up getting but most of the ones I've encountered during the times I've gone had attitudes that I chose to ignore because it was a fun, unique place that had good subs, and finally....to end this huge run on sentence there isn't even a bathroom to use. Just that, in itself is enough where I'd question going back but the whole experience including the food is just not worth making the trip there any longer. Stickers and history can only take you so far.
4 ||| Good cheap Chinese food. Close to home, so it's a winner with me. Always friendly, pretty consistent quality.
1 ||| I have come here twice, the first time I came here I got a blended coffee drink that wasn't terrible but wasn't memorable either... then the next time I came I got a sandwich that was pretty good but I could of made the same thing at home.... the staff is friendly though.. but I won't be going back....
0 ||| Foul tasting chicken. I don't know what else could make me so sad.
2 ||| If this is great Southern Food then I am a craw dad .  The Okra was not fresh and rather tasteless , the fish special wasn't fresh and was small and the cabbage was mushy.  I was married to a Mobile girl and this is not what I expected for Soul Food.. But it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent.
1 ||| went on June 8th with some girlfriends\nwe sat at end of bar due to 25 min wait for table.\nWaiter had a condescending way of saying \"you are going to eat here\"?  \nThen later everyone got food except me, he said I did not order and I know I ordered first. The girls were confused about what to order so I also helped them choose and he said he thought I was sharing with them. He asked if I wanted to order, first I said no and then decided I would.\nHere is what ticked me off ..he said\" I thought I would step back until you realized the stupid thing you said\" I couldn't believe he would say that and from then on his service was absent.\nfood was good but his behavior as a professional server was disappointing ....
3 ||| My mother-in-law was in town, so we decided to go get mani/ pedis. I found this place and thought the reviews were pretty decent and decided to give them a try. \n\nFirst, they were very friendly and gave us both great pedicures. We both got the deluxe (mid-range) one and they did a great job.  But that's where the fun ended. \n\nI got a regular manicure, which went fine until I got outside and realized how horrible the paint job was! She gave me 2 coats, but the second only covered about 60% of my nail and you can clearly see the layers. She also shredded my cuticles (it wasn't painful, just didn't clean them up after trimming them).  I had to fix them myself when I went home. \n\nSave yourself the money and paint your nails at home. But, if you're looking for a good pedicure, I would definitely recommend them!
3 ||| I was at this dealership on February 25th 2014 around 10:00am to buy a car at that same day. I asked the salesman who is an older white gentleman with a puffy mustache if I can see the car from the inside to get the feel of the car (2012 Dodge Charger SE) so if I like it I'll buy there and then, but when I asked does he mind if I test drive it he said \"Yes I do mind\" I asked why and this was his response \"My boss wants to make sure we have people who test drive cars who can actually afford them\" I just sent the dealership an email what happened and how they missed on a sale because after that I went to O'brien Autopark who have really good salesman who work with and don't ask questions, I purchased a 2013 Volkswagen CC Luxury for $26,995 while the Charger was around $20,000 so Shelby Motors missed on really good sale and and turns out I CAN AFFORD THE CAR! I recommend O'Brien Autopark  awesome salesman who don't judge on your age! I'm 19.
2 ||| I have to agree with Jeffrey C here. Great service, old-school barbecue atmosphere, but really really lousy barbecue. Low and slow is the way to go boys. Chicken tasted like petrified wood. barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with. Their cuts seem to be on the cheap and tough side. Even ribs that should've fallen off the bone were tough and harsh. Barbecue sauce way too heavy and vinegar and not enough heat. Presentation is a big cafeteria zero. The Brunswick stew was chopped up mishmash that looked really disgusting although it tasted reasonably decent. Hush puppies were the only thing that lived up to advertising. Local yelpers let me down here, or y'all just haven't had much good barbecue. Tickets one star for service and one star for atmosphere. If they could find someone who can cook in that great smoker, then it might be a really cool hip place.
3 ||| I was in town for business and to my surprise one evening as I was driving back to my hotel, I came across this place - a market center with a Chinese grocery store that *used* to be a 99 Ranch... which is now 2 years a Super L.  Okay on to the review of Lao Ching Hing... THIS IS NOT Shanghainese food!  Looking at the customer they seemed to be all native speaking Chinese... but I was disappointed.  I ordered the house special hot pot.  It had seafood (fish, imitation crab meat, greens, and carrots).  Now as far as hot pot goes, it's a failure.  The food itself was more like seafood soup.  The fish and veggies were still tasty, but as far as Chinese food goes, no.   Yes, the rice was re-heated.  \n\nMay be I was expecting too much.  I'll be in town again, and might give them another chance.
4 ||| I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years.  5 stars without a doubt.\n\nStandouts are the Italian beef with \"lots o hot\".  Their cheese fries are absolute perfection...  here's why.  Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE.\n\nWhen you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries.\n\nThen, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping.\n\nOh, I have to mention the cheese steak.  I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it \"Philly Style\" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to.\n\nYum yum yum.
4 ||| THE BEST Chinese in Charlotte.  Hands down.  Great service.  If you are thinking of going to PF Chang's...keep moving down the street to Sharon Corners.  Shopping center is difficult to get in and out of but it is worth it.
4 ||| Quick, polite, friendly, professional yet funny crew of employees they have here.  Their prices reflect that they understand what people need due to the economy.  I only wish they had more plugs for when one needs to work on their electronic device while waiting.  Mine started to die and I had to charge my laptop in an odd spot that left me in the way of employees and customers.  HOWEVER, I still highly recommend these guys.
1 ||| I don't think I get the Z Tejas paradigm.  I've gone here twice for work lunches on other people's dimes, and I can honestly say that the food doesn't make sense to me.  It's like they've taken great Mexican food dishes and then tried to yuppify them so they appear to be hip, trendy, and healthy.  They fail on all three counts and destroy the flavor in the process.\n\nThis particular restaurant completely forgot about one person's food and he had to eat awkwardly after everyone else was already done.  They comped his meal, but since he wasn't paying for it anyway, it was no consolation to him.\n\nNo me gusta!
1 ||| It was a decently filling sandwich, but nothing special about it. I had the cheese fries (it was pretty much molten cheese with bits of fries in it) and the cheese steak sandwich.  It was definitely great to try but I didn't enjoy the mess and the sandwich was a bit bland. Great location to people watch, but would I come here again? Probably not.
1 ||| Los Taquitos isn't really a place you go to eat eat side since there isn't really room to sit. The food is decently priced but the portions are pretty small compared to filibertos. The only reason I come back and pay more is because the quality is better. The tortillas are amazing as well as the beans. Filibs can't even compete in the area. The staff isn't really friendly but they also aren't rude. They are just in between. I will keep coming back for the flavor that you don't get at most other tiny fast food joints. Based on the many phone orders my friends and I have ordered over the years they usually mess it up in one way or another so be careful.
0 ||| The car was nice, the service was terrible. Can I give zero stars?
0 ||| Socks... that's about all I can rely on this store for.  And I usually don't buy them until I get that 30% off coupon in the mail.  I don't mean the 15% or 20% one.  I mean 30% LOL.  Kohl's ticket prices are so outrageous that even with a sale and your coupon you're MAYBE paying what the item is actually worth. \n\nI will say the best thing about this place (because it's obviously not the prices or the merchandise) is the customer service.  Long ago we bought a single cup coffee maker from Kohl's and we just don't have luck with them.  We've had a number of them that broke within the first couple of months and when we've brought them back the service has been excellent.  No hassle; very friendly; easy exchanges/returns for other items.  \n\nThe kohl's cash is the biggest racket out there.  So I spend 50 bucks and you give me $10 to use on a future shopping trip?  It's like a bad relationship.  Just let me go Kohl's!  Don't fall victim to the Kohl's cash!
1 ||| The good: Nice ambiance, friendly service. I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area... that's the golden standard). Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign. \n\nThe bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! \n\nIf you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). \n\nThe sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it? \n\nThe ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!\n\nWhat about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. \n\nAre we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.\n\nSo why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt. Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob; YMMV
1 ||| decided to check this place out after reading the reviews and its true 3 workers and only 1 was very helpful. didn't buy anything but nice selection of rc cars and a little bit of airplanes.
4 ||| Finally go to the Tip Top last night for dinner and had a great experience.  Great job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun.\n  Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices.  Food was way better than expected - huge portions, excellent quality, and nicely different than the usual Madtown fare.  \n\nWe had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles.  Huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well.   Then, thank God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance.  \n\nTwelve taps, good cocktails, great service and a friendly atmosphere.  Hope you do well Tip Top!
0 ||| The beef my husband had smelled B A D
4 ||| We love this restaurant!  The food is simply too wonderful to describe.  Our goal is to sample every item on the menu.  They all sound wonderful.  If you love seafood prepared with style and imagination, you should check out this place.
4 ||| Good pizza, nice people, great rock and roll. Coupons, too. What more can you ask?
1 ||| nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure.
2 ||| This is a DINER at a CAR DEALERSHIP.  It's not gonna be gourmet.  You have to know that going in.\n\nThat being said, I've eaten here a couple of times in a pinch.  I always get the soup.  My favorite was the buffalo chicken soup I tried (sounds weird but it's good)... however, it wasn't all that hot.  It was just kind of tepid.  Whatever.  It's food.  \n\nTheir iced coffees are goooooood.  They will add any syrups you want and they have sugar-free ones too.  The guy I usually see behind the counter really bends over backwards to make sure your drink tastes good.\n\nI mean, three stars might be a bit generous, but it is what it is.  It's a car dealership diner.  It does the job.
4 ||| Get the salt-baked fried octopus! This the the best dish there.\n\nAvoid the short ribs in black pepper sauce; 'twas quite rubbery and bland.
4 ||| Went in and the staff was excellent. Explained the flower arrangements and prices. Mother inlaw was so happy. Win..win..
4 ||| Tornado Room is one of my top spots in Madison.  Enjoy Perfectly Crafted Cocktails?  The BEST Lamb Chops in all of Madison?  Maybe something a little Different like Frog Legs?  This Place has great food.  Not to Mention Awesome Steaks.  Check it out!
1 ||| Sad to see it go. \n\nClosing Monday and being replaced by a parking garage
4 ||| this place was cheap, delicious and had some of the best cake I've ever had in my entire life.  service was pretty good even with me being a greengo and I Ieft fuller and happier than I've left a restaurant in a long time.  my new favorite mexican place.
4 ||| It has been over a year since we ate here but a groupon set it up.  I had remembered that we liked the food a lot and was happy to try again.  It was 6pm on a Sunday night and they were just about full!  Our waiter, an older gentleman, took good care of us, he was quite busy but he didn't overlook us.  The bread, which I had remembered to be very good, still was, hot, soft focacia served with a small plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It was already poured and it had more vinegar than we wanted.  We ordered ravioli di pollo e portobello (chicken and mushrooms) and linguini vongole, cozze, e calamari (mussels, clams and squid), both $17.  The ravioli were delicious, 6 of them in a creamy mushroom sauce, and the linguini were covered in jet black mussel shells, small white clam shells and squid rings in a tomato based broth.  I ordered the red rather than the white sauce.  They put on as much parmesan cheese as you wanted, even if excessive!  I am taking away a half star for the pre-poured oil and vinegar and for the pre-grated cheese.  Our waiter did everything you would want except smile and show a bit of personality.  This is not a complaint but an observation.  Arrivederci is a 4.5 star restaurant with moderate prices and a lovely ambiance.
2 ||| Stayed here on business since it was off-season and the rate ($109) was attractive. I usually like the Homewood with its free beer.\n\nBeautiful entrance and lobby. My room wasn't quite ready so they comped me for two drinks at one of the two bars on site. The site is fairly spread out so I agree with JD...if you don't like to walk a quarter mile to your room, park near one of the other entrances.\n\nRoom was clean and roomy, although for two nights, I was awoken .... awakened  ... woken up... aroused... by this loud creaking in the ceiling above me. Thought I was back at my Mom's house when my older brothers would try to sneak in after curfew. Brand new flat screen was recently installed.\n\nHousekeeping did a nice job.\n\nFitness center was fairly appointed but major gripe... it doesn't open until 6am.  For an East Coast guy here on business and in the office at 5am AZ time, this is unacceptable.
4 ||| This place is awesome! Was my first time trying it, thanks to my gf. The workers are definitely cool and very welcoming! I had the \"Acapulco gold\" sandwich, it was 10000000x better than what I thought.. This is definitely my new fav sandwich spot! Thanks!! You need to open one in the LA area, like Venice beach!!! It would make so much sense and money for sure!!!!
0 ||| only had the food here once - the gyro-like thing, which wasn't impressive but wasn't bad. had dessert here twice, first time was so good i couldn't stop thinking about it so i went back and got some black/white cake and it was terrible. UGH. i hate it when places do that - you need to keep it consistent! it wasn't even just that the cake tasted bad, but it wasn't moist at all and kept fell apart as if it were old and dry. sadness.
2 ||| Meh. Deals here are alright. You're not going to find a killer sale or an awesome Gucci purse for 40 bucks. Nordstrom Rack, like all stores has it's strengths and it's weaknesses. What I've found great about the Rack are it's selection of men's jeans. If you're going out to a party in a few hours and don't have the perfect pair of jeans, guaranteed you'll find a pair of True's or 7's for 50% off the original price. Shoes are good here too, as are sunglasses. Oh man, but if you're looking for any type of shirt GOOD LUCK. All the tops here are atrocious, it's like going to Ross. But yeah, you won't find amazing discounts here, but if you're looking to save a few bucks then go find yourself something nice.\n\nOh, and in agreement with Brian S, this place is packed with douchebags. They judge you with dirty looks and smirks, and rip their iPhones and flaunt them around. Give me a break. That's so typically North Scottsdale.
2 ||| No complaints... It is an average Chilies .
1 ||| Its suitable when you are dying for quick cheap pizza. \n\nI have lived within a block of them ever since they opened, I have eaten there three times in like 8 years. I try them again about once every two years to see if they have improved. Here is the problem: it just doesn't taste that good. Owner and employees are nice, but the product is average. They need to use better cheese, and tastier sauce. The crust is also average, way too chewy/doughy. \n\nIt's funny because if they just fixed their pizza they could really have a good thing - it's totally tucked away in this little corner by the fountain, outdoor seating is avail, in this tiny little strip mall with like zero competition for a two mile radius - local neighborhood people like me would totally get behind them, but the pizza is just not that good, sorry.
1 ||| To be honest, I only came here for the sheer novelty, but after seeing the prices at US Airways, I could understand why people would go here. \n\nAlso, as part of the novelty, I decided to have \"The Big Unit\".   It's exactly like what Tony Bourdain said, it tastes like a hot dog. Nothing remarkable, minus the fact you're eating a 22 inch hot dog. \n\nAs for flavor, it was salty, like it had been soaking in hot dog water, and it was a little cold at times. The cheese and chili was decent, but it really needed some onions and jalapeno.  The bun was delicious though. \n\nThe sides, fries and coleslaw, were also pretty tasty.\n\nBut the most important part is that I manned up, and took all of that dog. Next time, I'll try something else, but I'd definitely eat here over the inflated prices at the game.
4 ||| Wontons!!  I love the wontons here!  Must stop by for some every time I go to Vegas!
4 ||| They change their menu base on fresh food they get. It's the only real Italian restaurant in town. Good place for gathering and family.
0 ||| Stay away from \"Rip Off's 'r Us\"  I don't know how they stay in business. An Obtrusibe clerk estimated $59 to fix the ear on my frame and wouldn't guarantee how log they would last.  I( don't think I paid that much for those reading glasses total.  Then she estimated $419 for a new prescription with out even seeing my prescription or offering to show their very and obviously overpriced frames.\n\nThey should get rid of her.  I don't think I've paid more than $100 for reading glasees to for which she assumed were bi-focals.  \n\nAgain:  Rip Off, Rip Off and Stay away.  Go to Costco or Walmart.
1 ||| Sadly, I am forced to agree with Leslie M who wrote on 4/10. This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know \"you order it, you bought it\"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.
1 ||| I happened to be in Henderson for some training for my work.  One of the guys in my class went to Napoli's and got the two slice and soda lunch special for $5.99 yesterday.  I was intrigued so I went today.  I was there looking over the menu for a few minutes before anyone ever acknowledged I was there.  I guess the fact that the restaurant had very few patrons in it at 12:30 PM on a weekday should have been a sign to me this wasn't going to be a great experience.\n\nThe girls were on the phone and talking to each other in some European sounding language (maybe Russian).  Once I was finally asked what I wanted, I was rung up and asked if it was here or to go.  I told her \"to go\".  She then filled up my soda in a glass.  I reminded her it was \"to go\".  She asked \"are you sure?\"  I said \"yes\".  I even checked the receipt to see how she rung me up.  Good thing, too, because I paid her with a $20 and she only gave me change for a $10.  I pointed out that I had given her a $20.  She opened up the cash drawer to check and I guess she saw she had no $10's in the drawer because she then peeled out ten $1 bills and handed them to me.  She told me to drink the soda while I waited for my pizza to cook and she would give me a to go cup.\n\nWhile I was waiting, she came by and gave me my \"to go\" soda cup.  I thanked her.  When my order was ready, she asked me if I wanted more soda.  By this point, I was ready to leave so I told her \"no thanks\".  As I was leaving, she called me back and asked me if I had only ordered the two slice and soda meal.  I told her \"yes\".  I wasn't sure where this conversation was going at this point.  Maybe trying to make small talk since they seemed rather cold upon initial contact.  The girls were nice enough to look at, but their customer service skills were VERY lacking.\n\nThe slices were huge and the amount of toppings were sufficient, although I have had better pizza.  Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.  Still seeking that one magical pizza place in the Vegas valley that can keep my return business.
4 ||| stop by and say hi to mandy! i've been to the burgh a few times now and she is our favorite part of the north shore! best pub style bar by far in these parts
2 ||| The Kelly Strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed.  The facility has problems:  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips, the bathrooms don't really have the capacity for over 300 patrons, etc.\n\nBeyond the facility you get to the actual 'poorly executed' idea.  The staff is extremely un-knowledgeable about the subjects they are producing.  For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.  \n\nThe sad part about this is they REALLY try.  They throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity.  Don't expect great performances here, expect a talked up mediocre performance.  \n\nAudience follows content and they don't have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better.  Check back in in a couple of years.  This apple is too green to eat much less pay for.
1 ||| This place is misleading.  Wineburger is a great concept and name, but the place is nothing more than a strip mall burger joint.  Like other reviews, it's 95% bar, 5% restaurant with a cheers type atmosphere. \nWent on a Wednesday night and all the TVs were on a infomercial channel.  When I asked if they could put something else on, the middle aged Persian bartender told me that the cable was out and somehow we were stuck with a P90x drone .  Another flaw, the ventilation is so poor that you smell like you actually  fried the burgers on your stovetop. \nMany better places in Phoenix
0 ||| My experience here was 100% AWFUL. Was here for 2 hours to separate myself from a family plan. Nobody greeted us, it took at least 10 mins for someone to put us on the wait list. \n\nWhen I finally got to deal with the sales rep, I was very specific about what I wanted because I had already talked to someone at another location, but Zachary tried to upsell me too much. I sounded like a broken record repeating what I wanted to do. And each time I declined the extras he would reply with \"okaaay, whyyy\" and \"if you're going to buy this stuff somewhere else just tell me,\" NO! I don't want it!! I know he was doing his job, but Jesus. \n\nThis is THE worst verizon location, I will not be coming back and don't recommend you waste your time here.
2 ||| I had a flat tire and decided to go here. I had to left my bike as they said they can't do it right away. \n\nI came back and charged $20 for it!!
1 ||| Well let's make it simple, I love their Bakery especially the bread and they are very nice, but the only problem i see is the bad smell the moment I go inside.
3 ||| Wow, with the happy hour pricing we had a feast for under fifty bucks!\n\nI went with my boyfriend and our friend. The three of us ordered:\n\n- Sea bass and tofu hot/clay pot : Bubbling cauldron with pieces of fish coated in a breading and well-marinated tofu. This was highly recommended and while tasty, became soggy fast and the textures didn't do it for me. There were also random pieces of char siu that struck me as incongruous. \n- Salt and pepper pork : Kind of like pork nuggets. Juicy, crispy and easy to eat a whole piece in one bite, these disappeared but would've been more memorable with the right sauce. \n- Scrambled eggs with char siu : One of my favorites from the meal. The eggs were well cooked and had nice little bits of char siu- some of the pieces of pork were burnt, which ruined the creaminess from the eggs\n- Half roast duck : Lots of bony pieces, but the meat was juicy and the skin had a nice crackle to it. The dipping sauce was great!\n- Steamed dumplings : Just ok. \n\nOur whole meal, including a large bowl of free soup and a huge bowl of rice, came out to $46 or so. Awesome!\n\nOverall the food was better than the average americanized chinese, but I wasn't magically transported to Hong Kong or anything. It came out fast but we were the only people there.\n\nThere was a lone, sad looking geoduck in a tank near the door. Some of their other seafood looked nice but the prices aren't listed.
1 ||| Huge portions.  Not very tasty though.  Overpriced.  Decent atmosphere.  I don't know why it's so packed.  \n\nDisappointing beer selection.  They had Dogfish Head and I said \"60 minute\" or \"90 minute\"?  The waiter said \"Dogfish\".  I said \"which one?\"  He said \"Dogfish\"  So I said \"Who's on first, what's on second and I don't know's on third.\"  And then I ordered a lemonade because $1 went to finding a cure for cancer.  The lemonade was awful.  Just a cup of sugar including sugar drizzled on the rim of the glass.\n\nDesserts were good.  But they gave us a really long skinny fork that was more like chopsticks.  Ever tried to eat ice cream or cheesecake with chopsticks?  Uh, yeah.\n\nMy co-patrons ordered steaks and reviews were mixed.  I ordered some kind of encrusted salmon.  OK.  The fried spinach was good but too salty.\n\nBack to the huge portions.  Michelle Obama would not be a happy camper here.  They could change the name from Firebirds to Obesebirds.  It was too much.\n\nI'm still in a daze from going here.  Sorry, but there are so many better restaurants at a much better price.
2 ||| We purchased a table four chairs at tent sale recently. We noticed several chairs had splits in wood near screws so sales rep had us pick out four chair we wanted. She put our name on them. Not one of these four chairs were delivered to our home today. 3 had split wood at the screws and the fourth has an entire top corner of chair damaged and split. \n\nHow did these chairs (especially the fourth one) even leave the warehouse? We are having a barbecue this weekend, so our family and friends certainly will not be impressed with our new furniture. \n\nI called customer service, the gentleman seemed very unimpressed, very complacent that I was very disappointed and unhappy. I was told \"we have plenty in the warehouse we'll let you know when we can come back out your way\".  Again, does anyone actually inspect furniture before it goes out for delivery?
2 ||| Cool location but I found the pizza to be kinda average. The Italian hoagie was good. Parking was a nightmare.
0 ||| Ok I can only say this: WTF?  No wonder this chain is having financial problems.  I went in to find items that were in the Sunday sales circular and this location had NONE of them. Again WTF?  Nor did they have any staff that cared about helping anyone find anything.  I was in that store looking for things for about 30 minutes and the only person who spoke to me was the panhandler outside the store.  The paid staff was too busy somewhere else 'cause they sure weren't visible in the store.
0 ||| I consider just going to a different cox store. I know that their customer service on the phone is excellent. But whenever it comes time for me to pay the Cox bill, their bill paying machine is ALWAYS down. \n\nThe seriously need another location in the north valley, because I'm always waiting atleast 20m to pay a bill. I go to United Beauty Supply two doors down while I wait. \n\nThe staff can also be rude. I've had great experiences and horrible experiences. They're not really informative about anything. If you ask a question, they ask a counter question. Example: Yesterday I went to pay a bill, and I said, \"Can you put me on the list, there are atleast 25 people here, I'm just going to run next door for a second.\" \"Are you leaving?\" STOP. ANSWERING. QUESTIONS. WITH QUESTIONS! He didn't give me an estimate after that. And it was honestly a 20m wait. There were people lined up outside of the store, that's how crowded it was, no joke!
0 ||| This place has a hefty grey haired man with quite the crappy attitude.With his Horrible customer service skills, it's no wonder he's stuck working in this tiny gun shop crammed in the corner of the tiniest strip mall. Just went in on a whim, to ask a question about a particular rifle, and he acted like a complete DICK. I felt very uninvited in the store, and wouldn't spend a dime in this place nor 10 seconds of my time.
4 ||| Great pie...I could eat a whole large though...if you like a thin crust, you will love this
1 ||| Stale donuts after 4 pm. This is the third time we have gone to this location after 4 pm. Happy a new location south of this one has opened on Tatum and G'way. The least the owner can do is offer donuts at half price after a particular time. Last time for this customer.
0 ||| Maybe the experience would have been different if I dined in, but I won't waste my money to experiment.    I ordered the teriyaki chicken which came in a soup of oil, the salad was iceberg lettuce (yum) and the vegetables were obviously from a frozen medley bag bought at the grocery store.   \n\nThe spider roll was sloppy.  The only thing that was DECENT was the miso soup, but that's kind of hard to mess up if you think about it.   I really don't get the other ratings, but maybe it failed on its way here.
3 ||| Awesome gym. Great trainers and facilities. Would definitely recommend this place. More expensive than most gyms but you get what you pay for. If you can get past the lady at the front desk being rude, you're golden!!
2 ||| Best red chili in town. Others have beat me to it, and it's no wonder. Norteno has been serving simple Tex-Mex with local flair since 1981. It's not much to look at, for sure. After driving by for so many years, I finally gave it a whirl and ordered take-out for five to sample its many specialties.\n\nWhat overwhelms is that it is home made, right there in that little building. You have to wonder how they do it, but damn! Sorry, Sylvia's. You've been de-throned.\n\nMy tastes included the red chili beef chimichanga, then smothered with more of the delicious rich red sauce. Even fried, the flour tortilla was somehow still moist and the minced beef melted like butter in my mouth. I added rice and beans like any gringo should. Yeah, the cheese on the beans was not melted by the time I got home, but how could it be? And unfortunately the stock used in the rice was not fresh, possibly cubed or powdered because its taste was explosive in some bites, absent in others. Rice was overcooked, but it was freshly made, not served for days and days after the batch was made like other places... nice.\n\nThe salsa was not the usual \"picktwosyllables\"-berto's watery vinegar, but its ground chili was brilliant. Makes a great addition to any dish: douse heavily for best results.\n\nNorteno makes their own chorizo, and it does not disappoint. Difficult to get excited about toenails, snouts, lips and assholes, but it's Mexican Spam, and it's home made!\n\nThe only puzzle for me is that after almost 30 years they haven't got their act together for a proper dining area or a better location. Diners must take orders to go, or sit in the lean-to at tables and seating from Kyoto Bowl under bad florescent lighting. I think the owner's going over to My Florist to have a look at the space. A bit much glass for me, but it's close to her original location anyway.
2 ||| The oil-change side is fantastic. The manager believes in superior service. But AVOID the inspection side.  Apparently they are two seperate divisions. Most of the time the inspection guy is nowhere to be found. Poor customer service also. Slow & doesn't want to be there. So, oil service side - excellent. Inspection side - HORRIBLE.
0 ||| Service is so slow and terrible. Food is not that great as a matter of fact it's the worst Chinese food we ever had . Not recommended for dining and not worth it at all. My family and I always come here before but now, NEVER EVER! I'd rather eat in McDonald's! Worst food and service!
2 ||| I'm pretty baffled by the reviews on here.  A friend and I went to try this bar out and made sure it was on a Steelers game night.  I will admit that it was a Monday but based on what I read here, I thought it would be packed with Steelers fans, beer flowing and boisterous fans.  Well, there were about 12 fans and 4-5 other people in casual attire.  I was pretty shocked.  Nevertheless, we decided to sit at the bar and grab a few cold ones.  So here are the pros and cons...\n\nPros: \n1) Nice, large space with plenty of TV's\n2) Pool tables for some bar fun!\n3) Friendly bartenders\n\nCons:\n1) Parking lot is small and likely overflows on weekends\n2) Very small, \"townie\" crowd even on game nights (again, it was a Monday)\n3) Curb appeal of bar is slim to none.  It's in a strip mall.\n4) Women's bathrooms could use some TLC, although the important facilities were in working order :)\n5) Out of the way location - near the airport.\n\nI'm not saying I'd never go back to try this place on a weekend (game night) if given an incentive, but other than that, can't say I'll be back.  And, unfortunately, I must disagree with some of the current Yelp reviews.  We actually left at halftime to check out a different venue.
3 ||| beautiful, beautiful, BEAUTIFUL clothing!\n\ni had walked by this place numerous times while on state street and had seen so many pretty things in the windows, i had to stop in.\n\nand lo!  there are more amazing dresses and skirts inside!\n\nthe people that work there are pretty nice.  very accommodating -- grabbing all the hard-to-reach dresses off the wall.  the clothing is quality and just .. well.. beautiful.  it makes you feel like, for lack of a better term, a princess.\n\nit's a bit pricey for me (the dress i bought was about $40 -- although i don't spend a lot on clothes).. . but for a once in a while treat, i would definitely stop in here again!
3 ||| Very good old fashioned ice cream. It certainly is miles above national chains. The decor of the shop is something of a throw back to an earlier, simpler time, which I also appreciate.\n\nThe taste tends to be very creamy and a bit overly sweet to me. They do not offer a particularly wide selection of flavors, and those that they do offer tend to be the tried and true, a tad on the boring side.\n\nI do like Dave&Andy's, but it does not have a hold over me -- which is perhaps just as well, since my office is only a block away!
3 ||| Pbr on tap, best cheesesteak in scottsdale and the pizza is good too.  If you are nearby go there, drink a beer, eat a cheesesteak and some fried mushrooms your stomach will thank you. This place rules!
0 ||| I used their catering services for a corporate training we were holding in our office. It was supposed to be delivered at noon. At 11:55, I received a call letting me know they were running a \"few minutes\" behind. Fast forward 35 minutes later, I am sitting on hold with them for 10 minutes trying to find out where our food is. The gal on the phone was rude and acted like I was out of line by asking where it might be.\n\nI guess I just assumed a chain as large as CPK would have their act together when it comes to these things. Instead they didn't offer an apology or ANYTHING. We definitely won't be using them for corporate catering again, or anything else for that matter.
0 ||| This is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to.  Here is a list of problems:\n\n1.  Too expensive for a hole in the wall.  I ordered two entrees, fried rice, egg rolls and two beverages.  The bill was $32.30\n2.  The egg roll was not an egg roll, it looked like a giant size deep fried hot pocket.  \n3.  I asked the waitress if we could return the egg roll because it was not what I was expecting. I didn't even have a single bite.   She told me it was already served to me so she wouldn't remove it from the bill.  It was $3.50. It's not like I was asking for some special VIP treatment or asking for my meal to be comped.\n4.  To end my dinner, there was a cricket crawling on the wall behind me.  That killed my appetite.  Also the place looked like a dump.  The ceiling looked like it had water damage.  The whole place was trashy looking.  \n\nIn conclusion, the food wasn't good, customer service was horrible, and the place is a dump -both inside and out.\nEFF this place!!!!
1 ||| Good place for wine and beer. Otherwise, place is expensive. I rather go out of my way to Trader Joes or Target. Not complaining about the quality of their stuff (produce and bakery are usually pretty good), just pricey. Oh, and their front staff act like they really love their job (sarcasm)!
3 ||| Great place for breakfast. Not your typical bacon and eggs. They the borderline special. Dammm good.
3 ||| This was the first visit for my family and I.  What prompted the visit was a gift card that I had recently received.  My wife and two small kids visited mid-afternoon for lunch.  The service was excellent and very prompt.  I ordered the 12 oz. Aspen sirloin with a loaded russet baked potato.  My wife ordered the 7 oz. sirloin with the sweet potato waffle fries.  They had an excellent kids menu, my daughter ordered the small sirloin and my son the chicken fingers.  They had a great selection of sides for the kids.  \n\nMy wife and I thought our meals tasted incredible.  The flavor of the steak was excellent!  My wife and I both thought our meals were phenomenal!  \n\nOur server, Joey, was very attentive the whole time and took good care of us.\n\nWe will be coming to this restaurant again!
3 ||| OMG... This place is a real deal. My hubby from Chicago who knows \"real Greek\" was impressed. Must try... Hummus. You can have a small order for $.50 which will go perfect with your pita. Oh, make sure to ask for a fresh pita for $1 more. Their 10 inch pita is home made vs. 7 inch is store kind pita (still good though...) a few additional tips; they close early like 8 pm. Also they make their food fresh so you will have to wait a while for your food.
3 ||| This is my second time getting a hair cut here and both times they were good....\n\nGot lucky the first time that I only waited 5mins on a Friday....but I arrived in Vegas at 8am... So it wasn't like Friday afternoon when it makes sense to have an appt.\n\nOn Wednesday I gotta hair cut from Johonny... He did a good job with my fade \nHe did a good job lining up my sideburns that most barbers have a hard time\n\nEach time I need a haircut and I'm in Vegas I always come here...\n\nHaircut price $12
2 ||| One Liner: Delicious food after getting a tat\n\nFood: (scale of 0-4) 3.2\nApparently Phoenix isn't just about Mexican food. This thai place offers quite a few delicious soups and noodles. Even the fried rice was good. The restaurant is sandwiched between a tattoo parlor and a biker's bar. It may not be the most desirable area to be in, but the food is definitely rewarding. Be careful on the spicy or hotness scale. It can get pretty spicy.\n\nExtras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.5\n\nService 0.1:\n \nDecor 0.1: \n\nSpeed 0: Incredibly slow.....so think twice before doing lunch here if you have limited time \n\nDessert 0.1: \n\nPrices 0.2:  \n\nMy score for this experience is 3.7 stars.
4 ||| I must say that the performances I have seen were excellent. Both were musicals. However, I am giving it 3 stars because the theater itself needs renovation and repairs. The steps up to seats in the main theater are loose, and it's only a matter of time before someone will be seriously hurt and sue them, so I hope that they take notice. Also, the top row is too small, and an employee at the theater admitted that when they constructed the seats, they ran out of space for the top row. Yet they still SELL TICKETS for that row, even though it's impossible to get to your seat. We had to change our seats. FYI, every ticket I have bought through GOLDSTAR, will get you the WORST seat in any theater. I guess you get what you pay for.
3 ||| Hey all you blondies, want a place that won't mess up your blonde!!! I have never had good luck when getting my hair done, whether it was getting colored or cut until I came here!!! You know when you say just take an inch off the bottom and they take 5!!! excuse me, you're not the one that has to grow it back...right!!! I will be comming here as long as I have hair! Ask for Kim, she rocks!!!!
2 ||| Food is good, service started out slow, but got better.  The salmon  cakes are the BOMB, and it's real fish (Not can).  Nice portions of food... Nice outside sitting if it's a nice day.
3 ||| The view of downtown is great; the food? not so much -- very limited ingredients on the plate, we both ordered fish and neither dish was good enough to match the view. The fish was too tight and overcooked, and the source didn't work that well with the fish. Overall it's just fine
3 ||| Eh, it was okay.  Might have been better if we had eaten there instead of delivery.  Had a pizza, the spaghetti with sausage, side salads and garlic knots.\n\nPizza was eh, but again was warm at best.  Spaghetti sauce was eh as well, and not enough.  Sausage was spicy and good - the high light.  Garlic knots seemed a little lacking on the flavor.\n\nAgain, we did delivery and it may be much better when eaten hot out of the oven.
3 ||| This was one of those nights when we just didn't have time to make dinner so we opted for the lazy way out and hit the drive-thru. Given that it was just before midnight, we tried to remain optimistic about what might be left in stock. One of the two \"Famous Bowls\" seemed more like the washed up, haggard version of famous, given that the bowl was barely half full. The remainder of our order wasn't horrible, but it wasn't fabulous either. On the bright side, the employee at the window was very good! He was friendly and speedy!
3 ||| First time at Riazzi's tonight. Had a celebration for 20 people. Table was ready as promised. I was first to arrive but waiter greeted me quickly and offered to take my drink order. There were already 8-10 parties seated at 5:30 PM -good start. \n\nAs guests arrived, same good service was offered. \n\nLots of different dishes ordered but I'll stick with what my family ordered. My wife sampled the antipasto salad and steamed mussels as an entree. Our daughter ordered from the gluten free menu and had the shrimp scampi with GF penne pasta and salad. Her husband ordered chicken piccata which came with a side of pasta and salad. Our youngest daughter ordered the spinach lasagne and I had the house special tortellini Riazzi pesto with a salad. \n\nThe mussels were tender, tasty and hot. There were plenty of them (about 18) too. The GF dish - shrimp scampi and penne, came with gluten ingredients. I don't know if the waiter/cook got confused by taking 20 orders or not, but there was only one GF order for the party. She didn't get to eat anything. Our waiter was so busy keeping up with everything that he didn't even offer a redo until the table was nearly cleared. The spinach lasagne was huge, plenty of sauce and cheese. The piccata was done right, with lots of capers. The side pasta was rather boring tho. My tortellini was outstanding and I recommend it tremendously. Over a dozen big, tender pillows in a rich, creamy pesto sauce. \n\nI would have liked to give Riazzi's five stars but you can't mess with allergies. I would suggest he circle the GF order on the ticket, highlight it is something!
0 ||| I would not recommend this hospital unless it is life or death and it's the closest to you. I had a recent trip to the ER where I was released and could not walk and was vomiting in the wheelchair on the way out when my discharge paperwork said to return if dizziness and vomiting occur. I had a facial fracture and concussion and was not given pain medication until I had to request it 1hr in to the visit.
0 ||| Words could not even express how angry I was after I left this place.  My friend and I went there to get pedicures done a couple of weeks back. (I knew if I wrote this review right away, it would have been right down nasty)\n\nFirst off, we are told to sit in the chairs to soak our feet while waiting for a nail tech to assist us.  Jill got her lady first, and I am just sitting there....waiting....getting waterlogged.  Then I realize that this lady is going to do MY feet AFTER Jill's...even though there were other tech's available.  I look over at Jill while I am waiting and she is in pain.  She is not enjoying this one bit.\n\nNow...here we go about my feet.  Now...not to be disgusting, but my feet get dry.  The tech offers to remove the dead skin from my heels and said she will give me the sponge as a gift.  Ummm...thanks!  No word on charging me...but what should I expect?  My massage was very short...and she also hurt my feet while clipping and filing.  She had no TLC in her what's so ever.  When she was scrubbing my feet she yelled at me...\"Give me your hand...give me your hand...and feel!\"  Lady, I know what my feet feel like thank you very much.  No need to remind me on how my feet are.  I already know.\n\nSo when we are going up to pay....she said that mine was $10 more than my friends....I am like...whatever.  Where is my spongey thing you promised. \"I give!\"  No lady, you didn't give.  \"Oh, I will get it.\"  Yeah...thanks for it....from the effing garbage.\n\nI will go back to my normal place....where they treat me nice (to my face) and give me TLC on my feet.
0 ||| From reading other reviews and dining guides, it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. Either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking, or you don't. I fall into the later category: I didn't like it at all.\n\nI ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. For the pizza, the crust was salvageable after I pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). The salad was...nothing short of horrific. Overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese, getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.\n\nI don't get this place.
0 ||| Everytime I come to this particular Subway I remember why I avoid this one. Lets start with the food. If you order a kids meal, they use the leftover scraps of bread. Today, it was no longer than an inch and a half. One piece of ham folded over and it hung out the sides. Two pickles and a glob of mayonnaise the size of a dime in the middle. Lets go to their menu. Right now, 6\" cold cut or meatball subs are 2.00. They dont have that posted ANYWHERE. they tried to charge me full price and I had to show them my e-mail. With that said, good luck getting much veggies on your sandwich. While they make your sandwich you actually get the feeling you are inconveniencing them. They throw everything in very sloppy. Vinefar and oil they squirt in one spot. \nVery rude staff. I usually avoid this particular one. When I do come back to it, its always the same. Drive an extra couple miles to a different one.
0 ||| I don't know why I keep gravitating back to this HRC location because it's always been just blah at best. Last night's dinner was no different.\n\nWent with a party of 7 and we were smart to use their Please Excuse service found on the website so that we could cut to the front of the line before the Suns game. \n\nThe place was busy and our server appeared capable, but looks can be deceiving. As it turns out, service was what it usually is, slow. We had a mixture of sodas, water, beer, and mixed drinks at our table and unless we ASKED for a refill, it wasn't coming. We would have spent more on alcohol if the server seemed remotely interested in serving us.\n\nOur appetizers took FOREVER to come out. Meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table. The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla. It was tasty. Nothing special. The potato skins were particularly notable though as they were perfectly done and NOT greasy. Refills FINALLY came after we had to ask twice for them. \n\nDinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table. *sigh*\n\nMost of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers. I had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess. Someone had the bright idea of putting the guac on the burger before the cheese. The cheese is the glue and the guac goes on the bun. As soon as I attempted to pick it up to eat, everything slid all over and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were bland. And we waited again and again for refills.\n\nIt's conveniently located right across the street from the Suns arena and I think this is really the last time I\"m going to subject myself to this place. I've been to MANY HRC's across the globe and this one is the worst one. \n\nCan't SOMEONE put a decent place in downtown Phoenix? PLEASE!
4 ||| I've been known to hang out here lately on a few occasions.  I keep coming back, so that's always a tell tale sign that I'm digging on it.  I have to say, this is one of the best values for the area.\n\nI come here for two main reasons: 1. To get my fix of delicious steak at a price I can easily choke down, and 2. Fried pickles!  This makes for the perfect combo in my eyes.  Throw in a little margarita and we've got a full blown party going!\n\nOur service here has always been good.  I can't believe I haven't mentioned the free peanuts yet! \n\nOverall, great place to get the best bang for your buck.  It can easily be forgotten , tucked away amongst the billion restaurants by Concord Mills, but seek out and yee shall be rewarded.
0 ||| Dishonest dealers, stay away from this establishment like the plague. \nAlways comes up with a different story and not versed in customer service.\nGo to Scottsdale Gun Club for professional service and great selection.
1 ||| Due to my rating, I feel I must start off on a positive note. The employees here are stellar! They are very friendly and appreciate the fact that you have chosen their gym to work out in. I have belonged to two other gyms before and their customer service and friendliness does not compare by a long shot. So I must say, this location has the best employees ever!\n\nNow for the ugly. This gym is completely worn down. The equipment is very old and outdated and a lot of it is either out of service or not working up to par. One morning, I jumped to three different stationary bikes until I found one that operated properly. And a lot of their stationary bikes do not have water bottle holsters, which means I have to power through 15-20 minutes of cardio with my water on the floor next to the machine and not readily available to me when I need a quick refreshment through my burn.\n\nI was a member of this gym two years ago, and was with them for four years (five years total counting when I worked out at the one near Summerlin on W. Sahara) and thought it was ok. But, in comparison to the one I worked out at off of W. Sahara and being a member of LVAC for the past two years, this location has the absolute worse gym equipment I have come across. Sad day.\n\nI have to admit that I am going to test out Club Sport here sometime soon, solely based upon the fact that this location's equipment is just lackluster, outdated and poorly maintained. I hope the manager here and the 24 Hour Fitness brand reads these reviews and does something about this. As mentioned, love the employees and the people that work out here are super nice as well, but as a gym, it just doesn't cut it. At least not for me.
4 ||| The staff here make the experience. Since I am not a fan of buffets, I can only tell you about the meals here. DELICIOUS. I don't eat meat, my boyfriend almost only eats meat, we both found things we loved. it was the best! We liked to eat here once a week since it was so amazing.
2 ||| The most important thing about Boulder Station is if you don't have a car, don't get a room here.  The place is a long way from where almost every traveler wants to be.  The rooms are a reasonable size and newly redecorated and clean.  I like the casino because it offers better games to players.  The food at Boulder isn't as good as Sunset or the upscale station \"ranches\", and the clientele is a little lower on the socio-economic ladder than you will find at Sunset.  The price does reflects that.  I was content with my stay. It's more than 3 stars but less than 4.  So I'll give it 3, but it's really more of a 3 and a half.
2 ||| I know that others may disagree...but I was not impressed with the pizza at all.  A lot of the reviews are about the deal that they got...$5 for a pizza....and they would be correct.  That IS a great deal....but if you don't enjoy what you are eating....how good of a deal is it?  The crust was like cardboard (dry and tough) and there was not enough sauce on the pizza for our liking.  \nPersonally, I would prefer to pay a little more for a great pizza....but that is just me.
2 ||| I decided to give this place a try for a high school event about a year ago. This is now my go-to place whenever my friends and I are hungry and are looking for an all you can eat place. But during lunch, they don't serve all of the little side dishes that are usually served before the meat. No kimchi for lunch? Seriously? And gratuity is ridiculous. Besides those cons, the meat's pretty good and the service is good too.
1 ||| it is one of those Americanized Chinese food take-out place, so you know what to expect, I saw a lot of good review, so i gave a try, unfortunately,the food is not what real Chinese will like, probably it is because there are not many Chinese people living in henderson.
1 ||| Well....I got sucked in. I already dislike Domino's to begin with...But I have been seeing all those commercials where they are bagging on themselves and saying how the pizza is completely new and improved. \n\nWell that's a load of Horse $h!t. \n\nWe ordered a pizza last night because I am a bad wife and haven't gone grocery shopping. I say to the hubs, hey lets give it a shot. He moans in disgust. I say, well they say its completely new and improved, lets just try it out. \n\nWe ordered on line. That was really cool. You can follow your order in the shop while they are making it. We even knew our delivery drivers name before he got to our door because the update told us his name and that he just left. That's rad...I would give Domino's a 3 just on this alone! \n\nWe ordered their new pizza with the special crust and then new fancy sauce. Kept it simple and just got pepperoni on it. We also got an order of cheese bread sticks and some of there boneless chicken kicker things. \n\nThe chicken kickers were tasty. I really liked the dipping sauce. \n\nThe cheese bread was yummy as well! \n\nThe new fan-dangled pizza....HOLY GROSS!!! Same old Domino's people... \n\nDo not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial. \n\nThe commercial should go more like: \nHey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks. \nSo we changed it up and guess what PIZZA STILL SUCKS! \n\nOur cat that always begs for food didn't even come around asking for pizza. That's pretty bad, that cat will eat anything! In fact, from now on, any take out we get will have a Tuki (our cat) rating on it. \n\nTuki gives this zero stars, as he didn't even want it near him.
2 ||| Nice atmosphere. Cheeseburger was not all that.
4 ||| A friend referred me to Dr. Inga for a second opinion on a tooth another dentist told me I needed a root canal and a crown on. Dr. Inga was very friendly and taught me so much about my different options for my tooth. Come to find out, I didn't need a new crown after all, and Dr. Inga restored my tooth with a filling, and now it looks just like my natural teeth (shape AND color) and no pain. \n\nI've been to several dentists in town and no one has met my standards of care, judgment, and skills at a reasonable and affordable cost until now. My family and I come all the way from North Las Vegas to get the quality care from Dr. Inga and his staff--it is definitely worth the drive. If you want someone who really cares for your teeth and health as much or more than you do and someone who is updated in new techniques in dentistry, I highly recommend Dr. Inga.
0 ||| I could not recommend this business.  A recent install of a small piece of vinyl was poorly done and I had to clean up after the workers left.  Wax (from the bottom of the toilet) was in the bathtub and one of the workers had something on the bottom of his shoe that stained my carpet.  Can't believe the installers do not wear booties.  When I voiced my concerns the man in charge got very defensive. I did take pics in case this becomes a \"he said, she said\".  Not a good experience for the high price!
1 ||| Tried this food when in the in-laws wanted to pick up Chinese and come hang out. What a nightmare, food all tastes the same from Chx w/cashews, to beef lo mien, it literally tasted like everything was made in the same generic \"Chinese\" sauce meant to satisfy the masses. No thanks.....\n\nWill be looking elsewhere for Chinese in the Stallings, IT area
3 ||| Thank goodness this place was open past nine on a Thursday night.  I'll give four stars for that alone, but in all seriousness, our dining experience was very pleasant.  The waiter was excellent, knowing exactly what to say and do at all times, and the food was very good.  Sometimes I'm disappointed in pasta dishes at Italian restaurants; often they seem to taste better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld, but the Penne alla Norma was very tasty.  The wine was good, although I could not finish the large amount poured, but at least I felt I wasn't being ripped off.  \n\nNice atmosphere.  I look forward to trying this place out again, possibly for take-out lunch when the prices are a little lower.
0 ||| Dear Charlotte Airport:\nWhy don't you pay your restroom attendants enough money so that they don't have to beg for tips? After spending money for the flight, an extra $25 for checking a bag, $4.49 for a teeny bag of nuts, and $8.50 for a $5 salad, I just don't FEEL like tipping to use a[n admittedly clean] public restroom. Pay these people decent wages.\nAlso, why do people have to sit on the FLOOR to use the electrical outlets? You lose three stars for these things. You get one back for your superior recycling system.\nYour pal,\nAmanda\np.s. I think you may have fleas.
1 ||| Not bad place for Tea and food.  But the owner/guy behind the bar, needs to lighten up.  I go there 3-5 times a week when I am in town and he always makes you feel as if you are a burden.  With the dozens of other, equally exceptional Tea cafes popping up all around nearby them, they should work on their attitudes.
0 ||| Not exactly what I expected. All the ranting and raving I hear about this place, well it's on the lower end of places where I would eat steak. Asked for Medium steak and received closer to medium well. Don't think I'll be visiting any time soon. Creme brulee dessert was not better than the Keg.
0 ||| We ordered bridesmaids dresses, and they came 3 months late, and in the wrong color. We then set up appointments for alterations. When we went in for alterations, we were told that they didn't have time to do it, and to go to another store. We were then given a ton of attitude by the staff, and were denied a chance to speak with a manager. Since then, they've added us to some sort of call list, where their 800 number calls us 6 times a day, and hangs up. \n\nI wish I could give them 0 stars.
3 ||| We recently stayed two nights at the Holiday Inn and Suites Madison West.  We really enjoyed this hotel.  The pool and waterpark area make this hotel a little better then others in the area.  The waterpark is more for children under 8 years old, our near 4 year old really enjoyed the water slides here, but would be overwhelmed by slides at the dells.  I was very annoyed that there was zero soap and shampoo in our room on arrival.  I had to walk around the halls to find the maid to get some soap.\n\nThe next day our room was not cleaned when we returned at 2pm, but we called the front desk and it was cleaned quickly.  This time the maid only left 1 bottle of each shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and etc.  I have long hair and we had 3 people in our room, the maids need to leave more shampoos.  \n\nThis hotel needs to supply free breakfast coupons for the hotel restaurant.  We paid $315.90 for two nights, I've come to expect a free breakfast for that kind of money.  We were surprised that breakfast was not provide.  Yes, the kid's meal was free, but I feel like a free breakfast should be a given at this type of hotel.
4 ||| Love the food.  Very nicely prepared.  Love the atmosphere.  Very dependable.
3 ||| I had the \"Carson Palmer\" green chili buro it was awesome. The meat was tender and could've eaten with out teeth, flavor was robust and cheesy, yummy! The service was super friendly and loved the music that was playing. It was like they hacked my I-pod. The only reason for 4 stars is the place could use some updating otherwise it would've been 5.
4 ||| I was crushed when Portofino's in Mooresville closed down, because when I was working in the area, it was my definite go to spot for lunch.  I was out & about today in the South Park area & just had to get my cheesesteak fix...& at the lunch price, no less!\n\nI called my order in at 1:15 & was told it would be 15 minutes. I was at South Park Mall, when I called the order in, so I wasn't too far away. When I arrived at little before 1:30, my order was waiting for me. The restaurant was still a bit busy with the lunch crowd.  I headed on to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. It was neat to see a familiar face in one of the waiters. He had worked at the Mooresville location & of course remembered me as being a regular. :) \n\nThe man who rang my order up was very friendly.  And of course, again, I was happy about receiving a seven-inch cheesesteak & a bag of Lay's plain chips for less than $7. \n\nThe restaurant is a decent size & as Jeff S. pointed out, it's \"done up\" in Italian style, as you would expect.  They do have a separate bar area, that's set off from the main dining area.\n\nWhen I got back to the house about 20 minutes later, the sandwich was still hot, thanks to being wrapped in aluminum foil. As hungry as I was, it didn't take much time for me to devour it.  Ohhhhh, it tasted just as good as I remembered! Thin, chopped up steak, with melted cheesy yumminess, & nice sized mushrooms.\n\nI'll definitely be back...
3 ||| I really wish I could give five stars because for the most part, we had an amazing dinner. We had two appetizers but the onion tart was my favorite and definitely lived up to the hype. I had the chicken and instead of saving half for left overs, I ate it all. My friends had the filet and the salmon which were delicious too. Finished it all off with a tasty cappuccino and the lemon tart. Which was good until I got a mouthful of plastic. When we told one of the servers, she didn't seem too surprised, shrugged and said \"Oh no, that's too bad.\" And that was that. It wasn't taken away, replaced, or removed from our considerable bill. For what we paid, I would have at least liked an acknowledgement for the mistake. If I do go back, it won't be for a while.
1 ||| I'm super sad to report that Bark Ave is no longer my fav vet of all time :(\nI really miss Dr. Casper.  Dr. Oarr, while very nice doesn't have the same way w/ my animals. In fact my bullmastiff actually attacked her which he's never done to anybody before. There's something about her that he just didn't like.  Also she doesn't provide the confidence in her treatments that Dr. Casper did. She always seems unsure and since vet visits are so expensive it's not the best idea to go with a dr. that you feel is experimenting with treatments.  \n\nSo we've decided to move on to another vet office in hopes of finding a better match.\nBonus this new vet accepts my pet insurance which will save us a lot of money each year.
3 ||| Boy, we had fun here.  Food was slow coming, but obviously was made to order.  Best lentils I've ever had.  Plantains were amazing.  Beef was a bit dry, but very flavorful.  Eclectic menu, and I look forward to trying more items.  The owner? gentleman, server was very friendly and helpful.  Great choice for lunch or dinner.
1 ||| If you have extra time to stand in line while enjoying the view of employees having fun and NOT waiting on customers........ this is a great choice for you. I would love for the Chipotle Corporate Executives come and just watch how they are losing money. Then they could write a manual on how NOT to run a Chipotle. Oh, and the rice was under cooked also.
2 ||| The brew is ok I have had better, and the pizza is ok, nothing crazy good and the atmosphere is alright, I'd rather go somewhere else any day.
0 ||| I was very disappointed.  I went in for a basic manicure and pedicure and it was a waste of my money. The pedicure spa was very clean but the quality was very bad. The nail polish selection was very limited and low quality. I did not want gel polish but the owner keep pressuring me to get it. Gel polish is not for everyone.  I could have done a better job. The polish was very streaky,  old, and clumpy. As for the manicure it was rushed because she had an agitated customer. I will never go back there again.
2 ||| I went today, needing an egg fix and crispy hash browns. I was disappointed in both my Denver Omelet and the hash browns. The omelet ingredients were absolutely overwhelmed by the flavor of onions ..and so were the hash browns. I like a few onions but quite often ask for them to be left out and should have done that today. And while I could see the prices on the menu, I was still kind of taken aback that my bill came to $14.37 before any tip. Service was Okay, although as I've said, when you're alone at a restaurant, the waitresses don't spend much time on you since they know the tip is going to be less than a table of 4. If I want eggs and hashbrowns in the future, I'll go back to the New Day cafe over on Silverado Ranch.
2 ||| Baja Fresh is not Chipotle Mexican Grill, not even close. But, what they are is a interesting upscale casual Mexican fast food restaurant. They were owned by Wendy's for a time, and Baja Fresh executes on their menu items more often then most, Qdoba comes to mind. \n\nThe quality of the food is good, but only slightly above average. Their newer seafood items are very bland and clearly they were aiming at Rubio's (one of their misses).  Prices are fair, but their main unique entree is their Salsa Bar which is very fresh and also very good!\n\nThe problem for the chain is that their locations are sometimes across the street from a Chipotle, as this one is.  I like the chain, but if I'm in my car I might drive pass them and go to Chipotle instead.  Sorry!
4 ||| Just getting back into reading comics again and it has been an easy transition with this store in town. It's a very polished up comic book shop and I love it! \nHave yet to go into the store and not gotten into a good discussion about anything from NPR, the Walking Dead to Edward Abbey. So, yah I've never been ignored here. To boot they always are really cool with my niece's rolling into their store. Most comic books stores cringe at the idea of 4 yr olds coming in looking through the comics. \nIf you like fun, you'll like Heroes!
3 ||| The atmosphere...cozy, great for taking a woman out for some nice italian.  The service...attentive and classy...The price...a bit on the steep side but the food...just not my cup of tea...(carrabas, carinos, olive garden, etc)...is better sad to say, I ordered the lasagna with minestroni soup...typically a safe bet, and my dining partner got mozzarella caprse.\nThe soup was dull in flavor, salt and pepper couldn't even save this soup...the one at olive garden is better sadly.  The lasagna was flat and small portioned, the one at carinos is better sadly...My partner loved her salad abobnination, i tasted it and wanted to gag.  Fine italian dining is just not my thing...\nI have to admit I would give it a 1 star on food merit alone, but the atmosphere is nicer than the chains, the service is fantastic, and the beginner bread and butter is probably the best I have ever had at an italian place.  I would probably come back to just drink some fancy wine and sober up by eating the bread.
0 ||| Upon moving to Arizona I had been using Frist Credit Union to do my banking because they offer shared banking with my credit union in Nebraska.  The process was easy to just go in and deposit money into my Nebraska account.  After awhile I decided I should open an account here in Arizona.  I went in and opened my account and everything was good for a short time.  I would bring in my checks and be able to have my funds available right away.  One Friday I brought my paycheck in and they said they had to verify my employment in order to put the check in my account.  Weird since they did that the first day I opened my account and weird since they had already cashed a couple of my paychecks.  Also, the company I work for is a huge company and has been in business since 1974.  So they called my work, verified my employment, deposited the check and the funds were available.  Next payday I go in and the same thing happens, they say they have to verify my employment...I am a little over it at this point.  They call and do their thing and deposit the check.  Next payday, same thing.  At this point I am getting upset because there is no reason to keep having to verify my employment.  I have worked there for 7 years!  I ask about this and tell them I am getting upset by this and the acted as though they really didn't care.  I needed my money so she calls, verifys my employment and comes back tells me there will  be a 10 day hold on my check. Seriously???  They have been cashing my checks since day 1 with no problems.  I put up a fuss and she tells me she will cut it down to a 4 day hold.  What???  So she can just make her own rules???  I told her to forget it and deposit it in my shared account in Nebraska.  She got really rude with me and told me they would put a hold on it also.  I looked her in the eye and told her to do it and I assured her they would never put a hold on any deposit in my account.    She deposited the money and guess what??? The money was immediatly available.  I told her to close my account because I was so pissed off.  She then told me I would be charged $35 to close it!!!  What???  She said it was stated in the paperwork I got when I opened my account... I looked through it all and I have nothing that states this.  To sum this up, DO NOT GIVE THIS CREDIT UNION YOUR MONEY!  They seem to have forgotten that they need our money, we don't need them.  There are a lot of  banks out there that are happy to have your money.
0 ||| This place is a disgrace on the original panera or paradise cafe. I know airport food is insipid and service is bad but never knew it was rude too. I was boarding a late flight with only this place open. I went and saw their menu to be pretty similar to panera and she told me they have a partnership with panera. My mom wanted something fruity so she said the strawberry smoothie is good. After discussion that it is from a mix and not fresh strawberries, i still ordered to realize they didnt have enough to make one. Why promise if you cant deliver?\n\nNext i ordered a mac and cheese (i ordered full, she range me for half). Then later i stoof for 15 min waiting for it. Saw a man come in who's sandwich they had forgotten. I reminded them twice about my mac and cheese. She went to the freezer, got a packages bag, heated it and gave it to me in a small. I was skeptical if it was full but thats ok. On tasting it was sooooper cold. I went back to the cashier and she took it back and blamed me for not having the receipt to process a refund as they didnot have another mac and cheese. I said i ordered full when i came to know they DIDNO HAVE full and gave me half. Again, why promsie if you cant deliver?\n\nThe staff is pretty rude and comical. A disgrace on the otherwise ok restaurant.
2 ||| I went to this salon b/c it was closer to my house than the one I usually go to. There were two techs and the one that did my nails did a great job but the one who took care of my daughter was awful.  The very next day her nails had chips on the tips and they were gel nails,  supposed to last 3-4 weeks. I took her back in so they could have the opportunity to fix the horrible job but they just filed her nails down where they were chipping.  A week and a half later, they look like a 4 year old did them.  We get our nails done on a regular basis and this salon had the chance to win our business long term but they blew it. I even gave them a second chance.  My nail tech gets 4 stars, the one that handled my daughter gets a goose egg.
4 ||| Walking into this place feels like walking into my home. You might be wondering why it feels like my home, and that's because I used to live in a barn. No, really, I did. The best thing about coming here is the cookin'. If the wife could cook this good, she would probably get more kisses from me. The pancakes taste like pancakes. The bacon is very crunchy and thick. The hashbrown casserole is very hashbrown casseroley. It tastes the way food should taste! I would recommend this place!\n\nA++ WOULD BUY AGAIN!
0 ||| Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what's going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.
1 ||| This was our favorite neighborhood spot. \n\nWas. The last two times our service has been so terrible it is unbearable. Over thirty minutes to have our order taken. Longer for drinks to be delivered. And a very annoyed condescending server when we asked questions. \n\nThere are many places nearby that would be better. We will not be back. So sad to see this place slide into decline.
1 ||| I am so sorry to rate Mert's so poorly but after the treatment received today I must admit to extreme disappointment in one of my previously favorite Charlotte establishments.  After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing, I decided to go with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday with lunch at Mert's.  After the most interesting discussion (!) with manager (?) I discovered that I did not have the necessary \"proof\" to rate the birthday \"deal\" in spite of having a valid NC driver license clearly showing my date of birth.  In today's economy, I was stunned that any food establishment would take such a tack with a good paying customer!  No worries on seeing my dollars at Mert's ever again.  To many restaurants want my patronage.\n-cheers
2 ||| Went to Red Devil on Bell Rd. yesterday (07/10) for lunch.  \n\nA little background.  I meet my brother and friends once a week for lunch.  We go to a couple of different places, and about 2 months ago put Red Devil into the rotation.  My 9 year old son has been coming with us since school is out for the summer.\n\nThe first time I brought my son w/ me, he was given a customer appreciation card.  He got a free soda, and then every time we come in there, we get the card punched.  After 10 punches, he gets to pick out a fish for their aquarium.  Got his 10 yesterday and picked out a Black Tetra.  Staff has been very nice to him!\n\nSince we have been going there, service has been top notch.  Every server we have has been attentive, knowledgable, and willing to accommodate special requests.  This is a RARE find today.\n\nOn to yesterdays lunch...\n\nRed Devil has some great lunch specials under $10.00  They have several pastas to choose from and all the pasta dishes come w/ either a salad or soup.  They also have a couple of pizza's on the lunch menu for $5.99 (they call it a personal pizza, but it was about a 12\" pie).\n\nI have been getting the spaghetti and meat balls lately.  The pasta is thinner than a regular spaghetti and is cooked al dente.  The red sauce; while not as good a mine, is very tasty.  The red sauce is thick and not watery at all.  They give you 2 average size meatballs in the dish.  I have had meatballs at some restaurants that are so dry, you need a glass of water to choke them down.  Not the case here.  The meatballs at Red Devil are very moist and go great w/ the sauce.\n\nAs I stated earlier, the pasta entries on the lunch menu come w/ a side of salad or soup.  I have been getting the salad; it's the standard iceberg lettuce w/ croutons, cucumber, carrot and onion.  What makes it so good is the house made Italian dressing they have to go with it.  The dressing has a very good flavor and they are not skimpy w/ it.\n\nMy son had the personal pizza w/ pepperoni.  Nice sized pizza (no salad w/ this one).  Thin crust NY style and plenty big for lunch.  Every pizza I have had at Red Devil has been good.  This one was no exception.  Sauce was good and had a nice amount of pepperoni on it (about 3 pieces per slice).  The sauce and toppings extended out to within 1/4-1/2 inch of the edge.  \n\nLunches also come w/ house made rolls and real butter.\n\nI have been to Red Devil about 8x in the last 3 months.  The service and food have been good each time.  The lunch specials are a good value and the service has been great.  I hope they don't change a thing!
2 ||| Is the food here Thai or Chinese?? Where is the basil, an important ingredient in Thai cuisine, in their dishes?? And the fish sauce, another crucial ingredient that marks Thai flavors?? This could pass for Americanized Chinese food though but I'll pass on this place next time...
0 ||| We found a stray Chihuahua mix that was reasonably healthy. We ran him by my regular vet, North Kennilworth - who I love, to see if he had a microchip but he did not. They were getting ready to close at noon, this was on a Saturday. We brought him home and then noticed that his feet were really red, raw and irritated. We weren't sure if he had mange, ringworm or possibly a burn. So we called Alta Vista since Kennilworth and Central Animal Hospital were closed and made an appt for 6:30 that evening. \n\nWhen we got to Alta Vista we waited for quite a while, maybe 20 minutes, before we were put into an exam room. Then waited another 10 - 15 minutes. \n\nA vet tech came in and did not do any type of exam, stood about 4 feet away from the table and just looked at his feet and said he probably has ring-worm. He went on to say that we would now most likely contract ring-worm from the dog. He said they need to run some tests to find out what it is and would go work up an estimate. He was very rude and acted like he was disgusted with this poor little Chihuahua. I had even given him a bath and he was smelling good!\n\nThen the vet came in and stood about 3 feet away from the table, would not touch the dog, did no exam what-so-ever and said we'd have to run some tests to see what the issue is. So after another 15 minutes or so, the vet tech came back with the estimate to run some tests. $500. So I said there's no way. They wanted to put him under to take a few skin scrapings from his feet and then test for all kinds of stuff. I've had dogs all my life and this was a scam!! They were trying to get money from us because we were desperate and no other vet was open. \n\nWe left the exam room and starting walking out the door and the girl behind the counter said we had to still pay for the exam. I said \"What exam? They didn't even touch the dog.\" She said we still have to pay. I said \"Too bad, they did not conduct an exam, did not even touch the dog. They just gave us a $500 estimate for crap we don't need. We are not paying for an exam that we did not get.\"\n\nWe went to Wag'n Wash and got some spray that gets rid of fungus, ringworm, you name it, it cures it. Vetericyn spray!! By Sunday his feet were better. \n\nMonday took him to Central Animal Hospital and she said it looked like a chemical burn and put him on an antibiotic and gave him vaccines, did a thorough exam and it was only $75. Go figure. \n\nThe dog is doing great now. Very happy, very healthy...ready to be adopted!!\n\nSHAME on money hungry Alta Vista!!! I will NEVER go there again.
3 ||| If this place were a bar by itself on a street somewhere, I'd probably be considering it for 4 stars.  Unfortunately, like many things in Las Vegas, it is tucked away in the corner of an obscenely large casino.  The casino in question is WAY off the strip.  The pub is up on the second or third floor and way off in the corner.    Our search for this place felt like an episode of  Lord of the Rings:  Following signs, backtracking, splitting up and meeting again, etc.  We had a great advantage over the hobbits in that we had our cell phones to keep in touch.  Furthermore, we could stop and rest along the way with booze, food, and of course craps.  Those poor little hobbits...\n\nOur 8 person party was escorted to a table through a labyrinth of small rooms/anterooms and seated for dinner.  We drank like fish, ate lots of fish and chips, and enjoyed the band.  It was for the most part a great bar band, the kind you often see in Vegas if you're just walking around.  It was a little jarring to have to leave the nice dark wood and dim lighting of the pub to go out into the casino and find the restroom, but we all survived.  \nUnless you're already out in Green Valley for some reason, I can't imagine any great reason to hit this place.  However if you are already in the building, it's a decent place to drink.  They also show lots of Rugby, Premier League, and other European/International sporting events at the usual early morning time if you're so inclined.
2 ||| Closing down for several months to add a kfc to a taco bell that is doing a perfectly fine business and then revising your hours so that you are not open as late doesn't impress me.
3 ||| The food and rolls on the happy hour menu are terrible, and the drinks are just OK. You have to sit in the bar area to get the happy hour prices, and it's always difficult to find somewhere to sit. I keep coming back here though, if I figure out why I'll update my review.
2 ||| Preface: Our family typically stays at SpringHill Suites (which are mostyl updated, gorgeous, comfy, and have amazing full breakfast) wherever we go, but of the Marriott family of hotels, this hotel was located in the best spot in Scottsdale and had the most reasonable price.  \n\nWe stayed at this TownPlace Suites two separate times in the same week, over Spring Break, with a trip to the Grand Canyon mid-week.  Our first room (building 3) had a new fridge, 80's green and beige decor, but two bedrooms with comfy beds, and minimal \"flair\".  The walls were not quite level, because our doors kept opening or closing depending on the angle of the walls and hinges.\n\nOur second room was very much like the first, only the appliances were older, and the doors were level.  The laundry facilities were aged, with broken glass in many of the driers' doors, though they did have plenty of machines.  They also took twice as long as the signs on the wall said they would, requiring additional quarters.  The front desk was less like a hotel and more like a desk in a home office.  The check-in on our first night was a strange man, but every woman who helped us was wonderful, helpful, friendly.  We were given a bag of baseball information and a free baseball upon check-in as well.  \n\nBreakfast was- gaunt.  I'm sure it is typical TownPlace Suites fare, cereal, cereal bars, small pieces of fruit, a handful of yogurts, and toast.  We have been spoiled by the smorgasbord provided by the SpringHill Suites with our every stay.  Coffee was good, and kept fresh well after lunchtime in the lobby/shop/breakfast/check-in area.  A computer with printer and internet access was available in the hallway just off this main lobby, across from the laundry, which was great for printing off boarding passes.\n\nTip: Bring your own detergent, softener sheets, and quarters to save money and time.  Do laundry before you fly or drive home from any hotel stay, and your \"back to normal\" will come twice as fast!
3 ||| Great food and service
3 ||| The waffles are some of the best I've ever had. I'm not much of a fried chicken kinda guy so I can't tell you if thats any good. \n\nCustomer service could be friendlier. We saw our waitress when she took our order and when she brought our food. She never checked up on us to ask if we needed any refills or anything else.\n\nMaybe the one in Scottsdale has better service.
2 ||| I've been a successful graphic designer/computer animator for the past 7 years and it was because of my Art Institute degree that I was able to first get my foot in the door. \n\nThe Good:\n- there are some amazing teachers at the school that provided real-world experience and wonderful mentoring skills\n- being surrounded by like-minded students in a creative environment\n- involving (and sometimes very challenging) assignments that tested my artistic ability\n- some job-placement assistance\n\nThe Bad:\n- tuition is expensive\n- I had some really lousy teachers too\n- some classes were a waste of time and money... I did not need to take \"Film Study\", really\n\nGoing back to The Art Institute as an alumni (graduate summer 2000), a lot of things have changed for the better.  The school is equipped with the newest technology, there is a cafe that serves lunches and there are many more extracurricular clubs and functions to be involved in.  Oh, they have added a parking structure too.
0 ||| terrible service we came in with family and friends with our groupons i let the waitress know 2 times that we each had one she said both times it was totally fine. we ate and food was definitely something you can eat at home. anyways we give them our groupons and the waitress says no we can only take one. if we take both we will loose money. ... ? so we she argued with us gave us attitude and sent her manager over and he yelled at us too !! he threatened us and said we have no option but to pay the 27 dollar bill and i told him i want paying that because i specifically said we had 2 so the manger calls the owner (as they're laughing and mocking us) a cop shows up!!! we ended up paying the bill but be ware of this terrible place. never again will i come. i dont wish this service uppn my worst enemy's! . these.people are so dramatic and by the way there were only 2 people at the place including us. there's no wonder they don't have business. ps. i've had better service at mcdonald's...
0 ||| We Americans like the Chinese buffet.  We know its not authentic.  We know its not healthy.  But, it satisfies some sinful desire.  Pizza, burgers, Mexican food, Chinese buffet.  It is part of the American culinary fabric.  If this sounds like you then this is your place.  It is always busy, so you know the food has not been sitting around long.  The patrons appear to be lower income.  The location is great.  Parking in the front and side are usually pretty full, so expect to park around back.  The employees are friendly, but don't expect much English.  The lunch buffet is $7.99.  What a bargain!  FYI: Bus loads of Chinese tourists arrive often, so beware because they will clean that place out.  I'll admit, this place is one of my guilty pleasures, just don't expect quality from a $7.99 buffet.  And, don't tell my foodie friends that I eat here.       ; - )
1 ||| Stopped back in the other day to grab a few more cigars for my trip to Mexico.  While I still like this place...they are SUPER ANAL about not touching the cigars.  The owner stands in the humidor while you shop to make sure you only pick up product that you are buying.  Rather bizarre.
4 ||| You really need to try's this place. Great sandwiches, a hot dog/sausage cart, and friendly service!
3 ||| Princess is great if you're in the area and are looking for a quick, really cheap middle-eastern bite. It's a small grocery store with a small counter in the back where you can order snacks, pita sandwiches and cheese and olives. It's also a great place to go for spices, teas and other middle eastern cooking supplies.\nI come for the Al-Wazah tea, which my Saudi friend always used to make. Also, for lunch (it's not too far from my work) I like getting a mix of grape leaves, falafel and hummus. Their hummus is OK but the baba ganoush is actually pretty good. \nThey have a lunch buffet, too, but I haven't been adventurous enough to try it, especially since I'm a vegetarian and most of the food seems meaty... \nThe place is also stocked with hookahs and other things, like calling cards and Quran-alarm clocks.
2 ||| I went to the Old Hickory House on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  I was looking forward to sampling some good BBQ.  I left very disappointed.  The restaurant was not very busy.   There were about 4 or 5 booths and one table with a big party of about 10 or 12 people.  The decor has definitely not changed recently.  The interior is dark with wooden paneled walls.  It looked like no one had touched a thing since it opened in 1957 which is not a good thing.  There was some paint peeling from AC duct running across the dining room and some of the chairs were patched with duct tape.  Overall the place looked like it could use a good scrub down.  This is not a bad thing, but for me if a place is like this the food better be very good.  The waitress let me know I could sit anywhere.  After I sat down the waitress came over to take my drink order and I also placed my order for lunch.  I ordered the large beef & pork plate which comes with 2 sides.  For the sides I choose baked beans and hushpuppies.  I requested to have them put the BBQ sauce on the side because I wanted to taste the meat without any sauce.  I took a while to get my food.  The waitress came by after about 4 or 5 minutes and appoligized because I sat down after the big table.  I told her I understood and it wasn't too much longer before my food came out.  Everything looked pretty good.  The pork & beef were both chopped.  I forgot to tell the waitress I wanted my beef sliced, but oh well.  I tried the pork first.  It was tender and that was the only good thing about it.  It was lukewarm and very bland tasting.  There was no smoke flavor at all.  I tried adding some of the BBQ sauce.  The sauce was thin with chunks of onions I think in it.  I thought it would have a vinegary tang, but it was sweet and had a citrus or fruit flavor.  It did not compliment the meat at all.  The beef was also tender, but again it didn't have much flavor and was also lukewarm.  The beans looked good with a thick sauce which is how I like them.  Like the meat they were very bland.  The tasted like they had just come out of a can.  The only redeeming thing about the meal were the hushpuppies.  The were crispy and hot with an excellent flavor.  The meal also comes with Texas toast.  One piece was brown on one side, burnt on the other.  The other piece was not toasted at all.  This kind of sums up what I think is going on at the Old Hickory House.  It probably was a great BBQ place at one time, but now, at least for my visit, there was no attention to detail of the food coming out of the kitchen.  The just is no quality control in the kitchen.  The prices are in line with other BBQ places I have eaten at in Charlotte and the food was not bad.   I have to say the service was excellent.  My waitress did a great job.  But with all the other choices out there my recommendation is to go somewhere else.
1 ||| I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants.  I have an even harsher view when it comes to Italian chain restaurants.  All that said....I dig the Macaroni Grill!  Before they came to Charlotte, I used to drive 45 minutes out of my way to eat with them....in Greenville, SC no less!
3 ||| Last night we were going to try a new place, went in and sat for 15 min never getting a drink. So leaving was a easy choice decided to come here to the village pub. As we walked in we were greeted right away.  Chris,  the bartender got us 2 beer's.  Asked if we wanted to see the menu. He then struck up a conversation with us. Wow the concept someone walks into a bar,  you greet them, get them drinks and then actually take a min and ask \"how's your day\". Thanks Chris.  And we will be back.
1 ||| Sports bar with the usual rowdy crowd, fried food and such, and underskilled but attractive waitresses.  Prices seemed high compared to other offerings in the area, but I suppose this is par for the course when it comes to places like this.  You're paying for the scenery, whether it be the ladies or the TV's.  Outside on the front there's a front deck that is \"netted\" in, almost as if to remind people that a lot of animals drink here.  Sigh...
4 ||| Ray's Pizza is the best!!!!!
4 ||| Gosh, the prices in here are great!  How is it possible that Wal-Mart can keep their prices so much lower than everyone else?  \n\nNo, greeter lady.  I can't spare any change.  \n\nWow.  I'll be reporting HER to management.\n\nOh my God!  Sweatpants for $3.99!
0 ||| I can't stand shopping here. Seriously! The check out line is ridiculous (and with all the candy and beef jerky they force you to stand next to in hopes of an impulse buy, you'd THINK you'd be able to find grab and go items like jump drives... alas, not when I was there.) Almost as ridiculous as the exchange/return process. The staff we talked to seemed to lack product  knowledge. I will NOT be back.
2 ||| My girlfriend and I are visiting Pittsburgh and we went to Fat Heads for dinner (see my Fat Heads Review if you haven't been there).  Afterwards, we were looking for a bar where we could watch the Pitt-'Nova basketball game and then have a few beers.  We came into Mario's becuase both of us were full and didn't want to walk on a full stomach from Fat Heads.  When we walked in there weren't many people there so we were able to secure a good spot, which helped out later in the night.  There are two parts to this bar, im not sure what the other bar is called but it's a smoking bar while Mario's isn't.  I'm not a smoker so I really appreciated that it was a smoke-free zone.  We proped up on a ledge towards the back of the bar in direct sight of the bartender so he came over very frequently to check on us.  One of the owners was standing next to us and we were chatting with him for an hour or so and he's running a great establishment.  \n\nThere is a good amount of TV's positioned behind the bar so if you're going there to watch a game you won't be disappointed.  We didn't eat so I'm not sure if the food is good or not.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I could definitely make Mario's my home bar.
3 ||| Pino's Pizza you are my new friend downtown.  This place is a traditional mom and pop Italian Pizza Place.  The Pizza is New York Style and is greasy bready flavor explosion delicious.  What surprising to me was how many other items they have on the menu such as pastas, and salads.  They also have dessert and a small but good wine and beer selection.  The prices are just right.  The large pizza is huge! They make it fresh with fresh ingredients.  The service was outstanding and friendly.  One thing I noticed was the owner was there and he knew the names of all his customers.  They have a lot of repeat customers which is makes you feel at home in this place.  I love it and you will too.
1 ||| Not the best... or even average. I ordered take out from here, and just finished eating right now. I got the crab puffs which had been highly reviewed from a fellow yelper. I was very disappointed, yes they were large. but not filled with crab or anything tastey...just filled with cold cream cheese. \n\nmy entree much in the same. it was cheap chicken that was oversalted. i think that the chef must be a smoker because he obviously cannot taste the salt content in his food.\n\nThe place was pretty full, so i'm guessing some of their dishes must be alright or people wouldn't eat there. I dont think ill be going back anytime soon, or ever at all. \n\nNext time ill just go to Panda Express across the street. its alot cheaper.
3 ||| I went in, had an original wineburger with grilled onions, american cheese, and a fried egg.  The burger came out piping hot...I actually had to wait a minute to eat it.  That's a good sign.  The burger was very charcoal-y which I thought added to the flavor.  But if you like yours very rare, make sure you ask them to make it that way.  The buns are soft but don't crumble under your grasp...again, a good sign.  It's all-in-all a really good burger.\n\nI also had the onion scoops.  Spicy and good.\n\nBeer selection was o.k., sort of odd, but I had a couple of Deep Canyon Ambers which were good, in frosty schooners (maybe 16 oz?).\n\nUnique atmosphere, feels very \"local\".\n\nI'll be back, it's a nice place to meet up with a couple of people for some good burgers and beer.
0 ||| I haven't been to this Waffle House location in about a year, so as far as I know, things may have gotten better.  The reason I stopped going was that the last time that I went, the waitress was incredibly rude to me, so much so that other guests started looking over at my table probably because they were so disturbed at the treatment I was receiving as well.  The waitress wouldn't look me in the eye, spoke harshly to me, and I had to ask her multiple times to tell me what my choices for soft drinks were.  I am 90 percent sure that this was a racial issue.  I was the only white person in the establishment and I feel that this was almost an attempt to send the message that I wasn't welcome there.  Well, it worked.  I haven't gone back.  I think whoever runs this Waffle House needs to ask him or herself whether this is the kind of reputation he or she wants it to have though.
4 ||| So far this is my favorite BBQ place I have been in the valley.  I stayed away from the pulled pork as I read in many reviews this was a bad meal.  \n\nI ordered the ribs a half slab which had two sides the beer battered fries which were really good and the bbq beans which were the highlight of the meal.  They were full of flavor and I wanted more.  The ribs were really good I enjoyed the sauce.  \n\nIf you are looking for a good BBQ spot this is a great one to try out just for most it may be a journey of a drive luckily I work close.
3 ||| Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.  They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later!\n\nThe wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!\n\nDefinitely worth the money!
1 ||| Our first time eating here. Maybe our expectations were too high, but we expected much better service and setting. Everyone's patio table wobbled, and our server was not very attentive. It took 3 tries to get him over. I made the mistake of using the women's restroom on our way out. If one judges a restaurant by its bathroom, this place must have a very dirty kitchen. Pictures attached. Wished we would have just gone to Vintners Grill instead of trying something new.
1 ||| I took my teenage daughter's 1996 960 here late this last summer because it wouldn't pass emissions due to both oxygen sensors (allegedly) being dead.  So I turn to the Volvo specialists I've used lots of times before for my own Volvo with few issues...except perhaps for the uncomfortable, stony silence they give you when your budget is bottomed out and you politely decline one of their suggested, additional services while embarrassedly explaining that you'll have to wait to get it done until you have more money.  Very uncomfortable.\n\nSo I'm thinking, no problem, these guys know their stuff, right? Apparently it *was* a problem, because after I made an appointment and dropped off my daughter's car, it took them 3 weeks and over $600 and the car STILL doesn't run!  :/ \n\nAdding to this, my husband and I had to call every few days and ask for an update on the car because we weren't being updated on the progress of the repair at all.  Have you ever had to placate an impatient 17 year old girl who needs her car to get to and from school?  It's living hell.\n\nIn fact, during one of the calls I made about the car's status, I discovered that they had replaced both oxygen sensors but that wasn't the problem, but they thought they had sorted out what the new hold up was but that nobody had gotten around to calling us to let us know any of this yet, and when I authorized them over the phone to address the new issue the response to me was \"Well, we have all these other cars ahead of you now\".  Wait...what?  Am I not ALSO a paying customer that also had an appointment?  How did I suddenly lose my place in 'line' behind all these other customers?  Shouldn't you finish my car before starting work on a different car?  :/\n\nSo yeah, after 3 weeks and over $600 they finally declared that they just didn't know what else to do with it and we paid our bill and picked up the car.  Fast forward a few months and it still hasn't passed emissions and just sits in my driveway, covered in dust, because I gave Volvo Am I all the money we could scrape together to sink into it and now I'm nervous to spend another penny since they couldn't figure it out the first time.   \n\nI'm not sure if I'm more offended that they thought we could afford repairs approaching half of the value of the car, or that we didn't deserve any follow up communications on the repair status, or that when I called to find out what was going on I discovered that we'd been dropped to the back of the line for no discernible reason whatsoever.\n\nSo yeah, I'm no longer a happy customer.
0 ||| Second time I've been here and it's still the same. We ordered the \"vegas\" style all you can eat because we liked the Kalbi. Everything is tasty yet the service there is absolutely horrible. We didn't get any plates, water, and rice when all of our meat came out. Whenever we asked for more water or more for some help with our grill, we got an attitude and had to wait more. Took us about 3 hours to get done instead of an hour or two if we had good service. Won't come here again.
1 ||| Yet another sports bar that's on campus.  Don't get the  mushroom soup here even though it sounds awesome!
0 ||| Not much in the way of culinary excellence in Sun City West. This particular Applebee's not only had microwaved crappy food but made me sick. Stay away.
4 ||| 11/17/10\n\nAnd yet, another WBC update- this time it's regarding the \"Thanksgiving\" sandwich, which was basically oven-roasted turkey, sage stuffing, and cranberry jam on delicious whole-grain bread.  Had the opportunity to try bite-sized samples at a Yelp event a few days before this visit and enjoyed it so much, I had to have a full sandwich soon after!  Well, OK, so I shared the other half w/ a petite cousin of mine-- she absolutely loved it! \n\nWe swore that the next time, we'd get our own Thanksgiving sandwiches.  No sharing!\n\n12/23/10\n\nDoing last-minute Christmas shopping FOR MYSELF, I soon felt hunger pangs and WBC was calling my name!  (It's so nice to know that I can always count on WBC for a tasty meal for those times I don't feel like hauling across the valley in search for good eats!)  The aromas that permeated the air as I approached its warm and intimate setting told me that I made the right decision to eat here.  I quickly peruse the menu, thinking I'd have the Butternut squash ravioli that appeared in so many OYEs this year, but lo!  What do I see?  WBC's added a few new sandwiches, and one hot option jumped at me, and its name was \"Braised Beef,\" ($7.99).  I'll try that one, please!\n\nThe braised beef was TOPPED w/ rosemary-gorgonzola mashed potatoes, served on a grilled ciabatta roll, and accompanied w/ au jus and horseradish sauce, w/ a side of both regular and sweet potato chips.  Let me tell you, the beef and mashed potato combo was incredible!  I ate the whole sandwich!  (Well, all of the beef and potatoes and half of the ciabatta roll.  Gotta keep a svelte figure, y'know?  LOL.)  I'm going to have to order this again the next time I visit!
0 ||| Worse staff EVER. The wait was long and once I got in there after being in tons of pain. They sent me away because they did have my medical records on hand to do the surgery I needed. Then after wasting my time and days off work The check out took 30 mins .I should have just walked out they are so unorganized they would not have even known.Do not go here,
0 ||| I have a puppy- shorkie, this was her first cut...I was quoted $40 over the phone and charged $45 when I picked her up. I asked for a teddy bear cut... the cut is horrible! Her cut is all choppy and uneven, the top of her head looks like he gave her flat top. When I got her home I noticed I cut on the underside, in the joint area of her hind leg. I'm very upset. I will never go there again nor would I recommend this business to anyone
0 ||| Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!
0 ||| Wow, dirty bathrooms, dirty concession stand. Just eww.
0 ||| I am very upset.  I want my money back or at least a refund for the difference in shipping costs, from two day the ACTUALL time it took because of THEIR CLERKS ERROR!  \n\nI brought a package in and paid for two day air and it is not there!  Been 4 days now! Paid for two day air.  The man at the counter of this UPS store decided to rearrange the address I gave him. I told him at the time. This is not how it is supposed to be addressed, \"see here\" I said. It is going to a dormitory. The format the college requested is as follows... \n\nXXXX\nXXXX\nXXX\nXXXX\n\n\nI show him my phone with the address in LARGE letters. \n\nHe said \"No, its fine...look here is the address.\"  I said, \"Are you sure?\"  The College requested it to be in a different format.\"   He said \"Its fine, it is correct.\" \n\nWRONG!!   WRONG!!  WRONG!!\n\nI have shipped fine from other carriers, amazon etc. only THIS STORE had a problem!!!  \n\nI have called UPS tracking and they are going to try to correct the clerk's error!   They also said I have to get my money back from THEM.  So I am asking for my money back!  BUT they don't even have an answering machine!!
4 ||| After a bit of deliberation, I decided Zenith is fully deserving of five stars.\n\nThe key to this justification is to remember the restaurant title \"Vegetarian CAFE\".  I will explain later...\n\nUpon entering Zenith, and as is well documented by the pictures, one is greeted by the warehouse everyone's mother would love to have!  Antiquities all over the place and those are extremely fairly priced as my mother-in-law was so elated to find.\n\nAfter a short wait, we were ushered into our table for Sunday brunch.  As I said, Zenith only claims to be a Vegetarian Cafe and, as such, goes above and beyond that claim but may fall short of a full fledged restaurant.  The salad bar is superfluous, while possibly a bit monotone in ingredients (pasta, veg, beans, pasta, veg, beans) with 10-12 different pasta and green salads.  There were two flavors of bread and then a menu of 6 entrees for only $10/person.
2 ||| 75% of the time they mess up your order.  Out of the entire store there is only one friendly guy up front.  Everyone else acts bothered if you ask about anything.  \n\nThe pizza itself tastes good and you really can't beat the price for the pizza that's the only reason I go back, but if they could only make it the way you order?!
2 ||| I have liked trio since the mid nineties...\nI still do. Good food, fair prices, but the service needs to be addressed... My party was treated  with the bare minimum of service, even less if we actually needed something.  I would easily rate them higher if the service improved.  My friend refused to even order dessert or after dinner goodies just to get away from the service.
3 ||| Hi,\nEven my husband went for a hair cut last week.it was good.\nI would also be tryign this week.Hopefully they work good on ladies long hair too.
1 ||| so apparently this isn't the one it was anymore.  sad.  The place I went to has now since closed, and is now run by other people and the food is so different now. BOO!\n\nAlso - don't fake like you were the ones on Triple D.  That's just sad.
2 ||| As a hotel  2 stars, as a catered event 4 stars.\n\nWe celebrated my parents anniversary at this hotel-casino.  Since my mom is a frequent gambler there, the hotel gave us special rates on their Courtyard rooms - very cheap ($42 a night).  I should've taken the tower room where my brother was at $69, much newer and easier to get around.  \n\nWhen I walked into m courtyard room, it smelled like crap, really.  I think it was either the shower drain and/or the AC.  They didn't have an elevator for the 2nd floor where I was, either.  And for those older customers or with crutches like I was (sprained ankle), it was no fun. Also, guests were blatantly smoking right next to the \"No Smoking\" sign inside the rear lobby.  My bedsheet the first night had lipstick remnant in the edge.  What was housekeeping doing? Normally, I would have left and gone to the other section.  But with my ankle the way it was, and no elevator nearby, it was better to stay put.  \n\nFofrtunately, I slept in the other bed.  I happened to have a mini can of Lysol and sprayed the room with it.  I also had a small bottle of cologne that I sprayed.  It was more tolerable.  Housekeeping was informed and the room was cleaner and fresher the next day. The TV worked fine, but the outlet with the free high speed didn't work.  Fortunately, there was wi fi, and my laptop got a very good signal.  That was cool  But how dumb - to get to the electrical outlets to plug your computer, you have to move the dresser with the TV on top.  I did, but I'm guessing a lot of people could not slide 200 lbs. so easily in a carpeted room.\n\nThere was activity in the hallway all night Friday and Sat. You could hear the neighbors next door, obviously young drunk men telling each other NOT to sleep and keep drinking and partying.  You could hear some of them say, F**K I have a headache.\n\nThe anniversary banquet was very nice however, definitely 4 stars for the $40 per person event.  From the time we first called till the actual event, the catering managers kept in touch and made sure everythnig was going as scheduled.  We started out with the program including interactive game for the anniversary couple, and much of the family members entertained using the DJ's microphone and sound system.  \n\nThe food was good for a catered event,  They brought the salads out in unison.  Ten minutes later, they cleared off the salad plates, and all of the entrees (chicken or beef) were put on the tables. After a half hour, the servers then removed the plates and served the dessert and coffee.  They poured wine, white or red. The serviers were good except that perv that kept staring at my nieces and almost tripped a few times because he was distracted.Then there was a two hour dance with lots of hip hop. disco. and evem some ballroom music per quest request, and the DJ kept things moving\n\nThere were some glitches overall, and none of us will stay in the Courtyard again.  Otherwise, we would go back there again, as long as we knew OJ Simpson wasn't around anywhere.
2 ||| Call me a criminal, but I don't like Vegas.  The only reason why I travel there several times a year is because my sister and her family live there.  And the Pinball Hall of Fame is in Vegas.  I usually stay at Boulder Station now because it's close to my sister's house.  And they have bingo every odd hour.\n\nIt's a quiet hotel/casino.  Definitely more for the locals and the Laughlin crowd.  But that's fine by me.  I don't particularly care for the insanity of the Strip.  When I'm not in LA, I like to get away from traffic and people!  \n\nIt's affordable too.  \n\nThe rooms are comfortable, they offer room service, and there is security at the entrance to the hotel tower at night so no local crazies have access to kill you in your sleep.
3 ||| First off this place is a dive!  Once you get past that you can go in and let ur hair down and have some fun. There are many problems however ...\n\n1. It's the only real lesbian bar around and they know it so there is NO catering to customers.\n\n2.  If it gets busy it's nearly impossible to get a drink. I must have spent 1/3 of the night in line getting drinks ( I wouldn't ask my beautiful gf to stand there)\n\n3.  They play a lot of country music. So when the country music is playing the dance floor is essentially EMPTY!  When they finally play a few good dance songs the dance floor explodes and it's a blast (but quickly ends to the sound of country music) \n\n3.  The place looks and smells like a dive. There are usually a ton of chicks there ( a lot are trashy tho based on decor, no expectations and no dress code). If the owner was smart she would spend a dime on the place and pretty it up a bit. Then maybe you could attract a little more upscale crowd ( you know us who have money to spend)   And as for dress code I am not saying suit and tie but maybe we could limit the old stained up wife beaters, shorts that hang mostly off the ass and flip flops u have owned since high school.\n\nAll in all we always have a good time when we go.  We will keep going back but I would love to see the owner or staff rake pride in the place. Also realize only 2 out of the 300 people are dancing to that country crap.  If u don't want to give it up totally then sneak a country on in here and there but let us dance to that awesome dance music you occasionally tease us with.
0 ||| Carne Asada fries were disappointing.
3 ||| Yes!  My husband and I are huge Thai food fans, and have a plethora of awesome choices in San Diego, and were very happy to eat here while in Vegas visiting a Vegas local.\n\nAll the dishes were made well and to order, and the atmosphere was nice and cozy.  I really enjoyed their stipulation on page 1 of the menu that \"parents are fully responsible for their children's activities in the restaurant.\"  This coming ironically after a trip to another Thai restuarant in Vegas and 2 very specific and obnoxious children were running wild through the restaurant.  Uck.\n\nThe very pretty \"silver\" container that the side of rice comes in is a nice presentation, but the plastic (?) doesn't keep the rice warm at all :-(\n\nMint chili noodles had a great flavour, but no mint?\n\nSpice eggplant was great as always.\n\nService is quick, efficient and helpful.  And they stay open between lunch and dinner hours!!!  (Charge dinner prices).
2 ||| This place has adequate food but it is certainly not astounding nor worth the price. The house salad comes with beets that taste canned. It's just not all that great of a place in the food department.\n\nHowever, I found the staff kind and generally willing to work with you on replacement sides. The restaurant is also quite kid-friendly (though there is no explicit \"kids menu\").
2 ||| Just because a place has been there awhile does not mean you will have a good dining experience. Yes, the chips are free and warm, but they are very thin and if you are dipping, most will break in half. Fonda uses that dumb salsa in a jar style which still makes no sense (Give us a bowl of salsa). My main course was a watery, messy disaster and the owner who I will call \"mama\" could barely defend her chile relleno after I called her out on the nasty food. The coating on the tiny pepper fell off and somehow it looked like my plate got flooded with pepper juice or an unknown liquid, possibly from the watery beans (see pics). Mama did shoot back a comment, but never full stood at our table and chatted after she got a negative response from me over the standard \"How is everything\" question. Keep serving up that slop mama and believing your Mexican food is good, but the smart diners will go elsewhere for a better experience. If I wanted soup, I would have ordered it mama!
2 ||| I was on the hunt for Argan Oil (great for hair and skin) and I initially went to Trader Joe's next door. The woman there said to try Hi Health and so I did even though I never go here. I asked one of the female employees there if they had Argan Oil and she said they did not. She didn't even look around first or ask anyone...As I was about to walk away one of her male coworkers spoke up and said he did think they carried Argan Oil. After searching for a minute he found it for me!! I left a happy customer.
4 ||| If you like hummus, then this is the place for you.  Super casual, Pita Jungle has a good mix of young and old patrons. On any given day you'll see students, executives and seniors. The ambiance is uber casual with concrete floors, upbeat music, and an outdoor patio. The servers are young and some look like they just came in from the pool! That doesn't mean the service is bad, exactly opposite. I have had good service every time I've gone in there. The menu is varied including hummus with chicken, lentil soup, pizzas, pita sandwiches, Greek salads and on and on. They also have a thirst quenching Arnold Palmer (lemonade and iced tea.) They are generous with their portions and are always cool with giving you a \"to go\" cup drink. (Almost a necessity in Arizona summer 100 degree temps!) Don't forget to try the baklava and pistachio ice cream for dessert..Yum! if you are looking for good food in a casual environment then this place is for you.
4 ||| YUM.  I popped in here for a quick breakfast sandwich, and it was incredibly good & affordable.  Hoping to return to try some of the other food items, but that toasted cheese bagel with ham, cheese, and egg was delicious.
1 ||| I was in Pittsburgh for work and one of the local guys suggested we try the Church Brew.  I'm not very familiar with Pittsburgh, but this place was somewhat out of the way.  It didn't have many interesting things around it.  Basically it's a bar/brewery built into an old abandoned church.\n\nThe place has been restored and is truly beautiful inside, with gorgeous stained glass windows, church pews, alter, and of course dining tables.  \n\nWe sat down and I watched as 4 of the waitstaff walked by without acknowledging out existence.  It turns out one of the waitstaff that ignored us, was our waiter.  Eventually he stopped by and took our drink order.  I ordered the Mexican Mole Stout, which was pretty good.  As the name suggests, it is a stout with mole spices.  I like stouts and love spicy food, so this was a must try.  As I said, it was good, but far from refreshing, so I suggest a glass of water with it.  \n\nAfter some time, our waiter again decided he should stop by and take a food order.  We both ordered the Shinkasa Cheese Steak because I was after all in PA...not Philly, but PA nonetheless.  When it finally arrived the sandwich was very good, but overpriced at $11 for it's size.  The fries portion was also small, but they were not that great anyway.\n\nWe waited again for the bill after completing our meals.  I would have actually ordered another beer because I wanted to try another of their varieties, but our waiter never returned.  My review gets 3 stars mostly based on the very cool setting of a brewery being in a church and the Mexican Mole Stout being tasty.  However the food is overpriced and the service was poor.  Cool place to try once, but I wouldn't consider this a \"must see\".
0 ||| I'm laying down in pain with Wolfman pizza in my belly. My guess is it won't be there for long, if you know what I mean. You can find better pizza at a local middle school cafeteria, or Chinese buffet. You pay for the flat screen TV's. This place sucks.
0 ||| Terrible service for overpriced moderate quality sushi in a roach infested strip mall. Skip this and head down to New Zealand cafe for something much better.  See my photo of the roach in the biz photos.
4 ||| I go for the delicious tofu soup.  \n\nI've never had Korean bbq here.  I stick to the late night, soul warming, boiling tofu and dumpling soup.  \n\nIt is cheap and filling and comes with all the fun little side dishes; banchan.\n\nThe broth is  rapidly boiling, chile laden and filled with chunks of silky tofu and beef dumplings.  They crack an egg into the little cauldron and you stir it up and enjoy.  It is also served with a bowl of rice.  The portion is good for 1 1/2 meals. All for around $8.  Every time, I request it spicy, and every time, it is not.  \n\nThey are open late so it is a good joint for late night comfort soup.
4 ||| The Molinari Pizza, the Sicilian Pan Pizza, The Picnic Sandwich, and (even though i missed it this time) the unbelievable Salt River Bar.  If you like Pomo, Pizzeria Bianco, or the like you will love the wood fired pizzas at Liberty Market.  Great concept, great food, and a very savvy menu.  I have full intentions of visiting this place as often as I can.
3 ||| I wanted to like this place but there was just something about the meal I had that just was not right.  Maybe it was my fault to get the dish that had almost every ingredient in it.  I will certainly try them again and hope for the best.
2 ||| So giving Chocolate Shoppe a 3 star is extremely painful for me. \nI have loved this place for oh SUCH a long time. \n\nFirst, things first- the ice-cream is still AWESOME chocolate shoppe, and it is still yummy!!!! \n\nOther Notes: They have removed their funky murals and look more like a sterile corporate run place, rather than a local corner ice cream shop. Oh well!! \n\nTwo bad service experiences get them a three star- possibly deserve even lower- but since food is still good, if you can live with the service go here. \n\nSo my most recent experience on Memorial Day was pretty poor. When we went in there were like 4 people ahead of us. Two of them walked out, shortly after the first one placed an order to a young boy working behind the counter. There was a young girl behind the counter but she seemed to be writing something, and checking on ice cream. While she did this the line continued to grow. \nThe young man, only one serving customers at this point- was nice enough- but obviously new, and should not have been waiting on customer by himself. Okay he finally gets to us- 2 chocolate shakes, please!!! Now there are about 10 people behind me. \n\nWhen the  guy starts working on our shakes, the girl finally starts helping customers. She is faster than the boy but moves at a leisurely pace with no sense of urgency for this long line. The guy takes 12ish minutes to get our milkshake done.  It took us about 20-25 minutes total  to get two milkshakes, with only two people actually ahead of us in line.And the line behind us growing... That's not OKAY.
1 ||| 100% completely underwhelming. I didn't want to rate it 2 (Meh. I've experienced better) but I even more so didn't want to rate it 3 (A-OK.) I don't consider this place to be A-OK, more like completely average.\n\nThe atmosphere is much larger than I thought it would be and is all counter order. They get packed for lunch and have lots of Chicago shit on the walls. It's a good enough place.\n\nMy Gyro Feta came with stale pita bread, too many giant slices of red onions that overwhelmed everything, and pretty much just seemed like something I'd find in my cafeteria at work. The quality was crap and it was $6.45. I could go to Cyprus Pita Grill and get a really good gyros for the same money.
3 ||| Love their sushi here. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. There is on street parking, and also a parking garage across the street.
3 ||| Pro: byo, the owner is hands on and hustles, friendly servers.  \ndiverse menu and all in our group of 6 were pleased with apps/salads/entrees/desserts. \n\nCon: a little cramped in spots\n\nGood special date spot and 4-8 person celebration spot where you can bust out a great bottle from your own cellar.
0 ||| Slumlords.  That's the only word I have for these people.  We're stuck with them until October, but I highly doubt we'll renew.  This has been the absolute worst rental experience of my life, and I've only been here two months.\n\nLet's start with the application process.  The person at the front desk is the most rude and unprofessional person I've ever had the displeasure of working with in a customer service position.  For starters, giving me directions to the place, the directions are wrong, telling me to take exit 2B instead of 3B.  An honest mistake as she likely thought I was coming from the opposite direction, but when I informed her she got snippy and argumentative with me.  So I get the keys to go and look at the place and it was a mess (little did I know they hadn't cleaned it yet - I can respect that but I should have been told).  When I bring up my concerns, some black in the bathroom I wanted to be checked if it was mildew or mold, carpet stains, stuff like that, the front desk person told me, and I quote, \"If it's such a problem for you, you should consider renting with someone else.\"  What?!?  She is argumentative and I have no idea how a person like that even has a position like that.  A trained monkey is more polite than her!\n\nWe still ended up renting the place.  In retrospect, we sure should have seen the red flags.  When I put in my application, they came back and told me I had a felony theft on my record.  News to me!  The only time I was ever arrested was when I was a kid playing mailbox baseball 20 years ago and that was a misdemeanor!  Turns out, there was a guy with the same first and last name (a common combination by the way), and same birth day and month (9 months after Christmas anyone?).  However, the guy was a different race, 20 years older than me, and - the kicker - DEAD!  Not that it mattered when I told them this, they still would not reduce the extra $300 security deposit they required due to it.  They also claimed credit issues, but my last landlady was blown away when I mentioned that as my credit came back great for them.  Whatever, we go with it.  Then when I'm signing the lease, the incredibly rude lady is actually rushing me and saying under her breath, and I quote, \"Come on, I want to go to lunch.\"  I'm sorry my financial future is infringing on your overly loud tummy rumblings.  Let me just skim this lease instead.  Sadly, time was an issue for the move, so I couldn't back out now and continued on.  I'm sure this will bite me later.  I request that the place be sprayed for bugs before move in and get new carpets and they agree.  Moving on.\n\nWe move in, have all kinds of problems with utilities that we are still having because the place used to be one address and is now another.  Can't really blame that on Berryhill though.  What we can blame on them is the cockroaches we saw starting on day 2 and continuously from that point forward.  The place is infested.  It's wintertime now so they're not as active, but I'm going to have to pay out of my own pocket to have the place sprayed come springtime.  Remember when I said I requested the place be sprayed before move in?  Yeah, scratch that!\n\nThen we begin to have problems with the house.  First, the refridgerator starts leaking inside itself.  We contact Berryhill, and to their credit they get someone out there quickly.  His fix?  Put some wood under it to tilt it back so it'll drain better. I'm not kidding here.  Next on the docket?  We're getting a washer installed and the installer notes that the floor is soft in the area it's supposed to go.  We contact Berryhill and they come out and look at it.  The fix?  Put some wood under the washer machine!!!  I swear if the toilet was clogged I already know their answer.  Put some wood under it!  Broken window?  Put some wood over it!  Tree fell on the place and lightning is raining down into our living room like the wrath of God?  Put some wood over it!!\n\nAnd now the kicker.  We got our second electric bill.  I thought the first was pretty high, but since it got to us late due to the previously mentioned address problem and we were in a rush to pay it I didn't really look into it then.  This second one though is where I notice that we're supposedly using 1200 kwh/month.  Just me and my girlfriend.  With our gas heat.  The majority of the electricity being used coming from the refridgerator and our computers which I already used a meter on to see those together should be costing us under $10 per month.  I call in to request they get an electrician out there to check the wiring and I get little miss rudeface again.  She actually tried to sell me on the idea that the extra electricity was being caused by our thermostat.  When I pointed out that a thermostat that uses 600 kwh/month is extremely broken(since that's how much extra is on our bill from what we should be using), she argued with me and treated me like I'm an idiot.  Guess they couldn't fix that with a piece of wood!
4 ||| The Ultimate Burger; served with brie and horseradish. \nCooked to PERFECTION.\nI love burgers more then anyone I know, I eat them everywhere and anywhere, and this one of the most superior burgers I have ever had.\n\nThe atmosphere is really mellow, especially for a joint on the southside.\nThe menu is simple, and everything seems to be done with care.\n\nMy server was great, a bit cold,but fast and accurate. Just the way a server should be.
4 ||| After a large weight loss I no longer had any bras that fit correctly, or at all.  I decided to bite the bullet and get a professional fitting.  I was nervous about what this would really entail?  Did I have to undress in front of someone, would she be handling my, ahem, cleavage? After debating this for weeks, I finally gave in and just went.  BTW, their current hours are Mon-Sat 10-5.  The shop was decent enough, clean, a bit outdated, but lots and lots of bras.  Big ones!  That was a plus for me, as a big-boobed girl.  I have always ordered my bras online because of my difficulty finding bras in my size, but at this point, I had no idea what size I was anymore.  The fitting consisted of (fully-clothed) a tape measurement below and above the breasts, and then at the fullest point.  She did a little hands-on around the arm pit level area for a feel of how full you are (not on the nips or anything.)  She guesstimated what size I was (correctly I must add) and then gave me a bra to try on in a regular dressing room.  Perfect fit.  I tried on 6 bras or so, and walked out with 4 of them within 30 minutes.  Her prices are comparable to other online lingerie stores, but you get the bonus of knowing that your purchase actually fits.  She has a huge selection of cute, sexy and functional bras.  My cleavage is now perky again and my back and shoulders feel so much better.  Why did I wait so long?  Go now!
2 ||| I've been here two different times, Once for a haircut and shave, another time for a \"trim\". The first time the haircut was great, however after the straight shave my neck bled for days on end and looked like I had been mauled by a bear. You would have thought that was warning enough to stay away but after a few months I decided to go get a neck trim. Bad Idea. Apparently when you tell someone your growing your hair out and to leave the top and sides alone, In Russian it mean to cut EVERYTHING and leave it a little longer than normal. Then when you do ask for it to be fixed they talk crap about you in Russian. Bad Business. I should have spend the extra time and gas driving to my regular barber at 19th and greenway.
3 ||| The pork BBQ was good, no doubt. However, you MUST have acquired a taste for Eastern NC BBQ, which is HEAVY in a VINEGAR sauce. I personally love the traditional sweet-style Southern BBQ. Now this is good pork-flavored BBQ. But I could only eat just so much of the vinegar. The portions were surprisingly small, as the sides were good but smaller than most BBQ joints. Overall, not bad. But there is MUCH better out there. If you love Eastern NC BBQ, you'll probably like this place much more than I did.
1 ||| Thank you to Bonnie T. who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S. Aiken Ave.  I will leave my review there!  BTW that move also came with a name change - they are now S. Aiken Bar and Grille.\n\nI was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed.  When I read that they had moved - I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say 'Village Pizza'.
3 ||| 3 1/2 stars\n\nIt was different. I like the atmosphere and warmth this place gives, it was very inviting. The vibe was calm and I enjoyed it. At first I thought this place literally grilled macaroni and I had no idea it was based on Italian food.\n\nService is quick and our waiter was very informative, she told us what the specials were and what kind of foods were good like the calamari. She also informed us about what kind of wine they had.\n\nAt first I got water because I didn't really know what kind of drinks were available but later when I felt comfortable enough I went ahead and ordered a Mojito and it was alright, I enjoyed it though. As for my main entree, I ordered the Filet steak with mash potato w/lobster. It was good, the meat had a good sear and was juicy, not too juicy though since I got it medium well done. I loved the mash potatos, I just wish there was a little more lobster, it was something new to me and it was great experiencing it... mash potato's and lobster who'd knew?\n\nThis place emphasized extra virgin olive oil almost on everything especially with the bread which left me wondering if they wanted us to hurry up and leave or it was made to make us feel full and satisfied, I assume it's to make us feel full and satisfied and I appreciate the strategy. Over all I enjoyed my experience with Macaroni Grill. I'd like to come back and check out the pasta dishes next time.
2 ||| You know what I hate about this place?\n\nIt's that they ALWAYS forget to not put mayonaise on my sandwiches when I ask them not to, so I call the corporate office to try and get a giftcard since I have bought about 10 20\" sandwiches, all with mayo with on them, and the lady I get on the phone basically just laughs at me, makes fun of me for being upset, and low and behold no giftcard.\n\nNOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL CUSTOMER APPRECIATION!!!!!
0 ||| One star for the awesome outdoor seating and one star for the Guitar Hero nights. I stopped going here last week because \n*I finally had to accept that when you pay with a debit card, the waitress just gives herself whatever tip she wants, regardless of what you actually wrote on the receipt.\n* The beer tastes watered-down and the food is ridiculously bland and over-priced.
3 ||| I guess things are bigger in Texas! These were the smallest wings I have ever had, I felt overcharged. The only reason we went here was because we were hungover and needed something really greasy. \nThis did the trick, and the food tasted fine. I guess I am just used to the wings at my Dallas location.\nWaitress was fantastic!
4 ||| Great coffee, nice ambiance, ecclectic crowd, I went in planning to people watch state street while enjoying a caffeine boost and spent most of my time eavesdropping on the bizarre conversations going on around me...very entertaining.
3 ||| Nice people but they are so slow and will have you sitting in rooms for an hour and think it's perfectly reasonable!
3 ||| Location was excellent! Rooms were very basic. For the price I expected a lot more. The hotel is in need of an upgrade. \n\nI was here for a USF bowl game and this was the team hotel. The location was next to the EpiCenter which had plenty of entertainment and restaurant options.\n\nIf I got a good deal, I'd come back.
3 ||| They do a good job, just very very expensive!!!
3 ||| Me and my hubby love going to this location. Everyone knows our name, they even ask me if they want to start extra crispy fries {I have a problem} when we get there. They know what we like and always do their best.\n\nWord to the wise: Do NOT sit anywhere but the bar and beware of the creepy manager {you'll know who, trust me} because he'll {did I just drop the gender there?} try to 'save the table' when there was a mistake in the kitchen, instead of just comping the food like a NORMAL person.\n\nThey have gone through a few GMs but the most recent one seems to have his head on straight and the staff turn over isn't as bad as it was.
1 ||| Not as nice as other savers I've been too. Maybe I was just disappointed because I drove a half hour and didn't find anything.  Also, they don't have any 50% off colors on Fridays which was a bummer too.
0 ||| Sent my mom and wife to Mystique Boutique as part of my mom's birthday gift. They couldn't have been more disappointed! Got this as part of Livingsocial deal. What a joke! First it promised a glass of champagne. They got none. When they inquired they were told they didn't have any. The technician jabbered on their phone the entire time they were doing the service. The place was less than clean. VERY DISAPPOINTING and not worth it. Wouldn't suggest this at all!
1 ||| Take note of the string of bad reviews recently posted...and respond accordingly by not patronizing this horrible establishment. Bad service and worse food. Everything is way over priced and disgusting. On a bright note, my server cared about her appearance as she spent the entire time at our table staring into the mirror on the wall behind us...
3 ||| It really pains me to do this, because Andy himself is such a cool and friendly dude, but after eating at Penn Ave Fish Company for so long...I just can't bring myself to get his sushi anymore. It's... just... not that good.  \n\nIt all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he \"lives\" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.\n\nI know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.  Penn Ave IS right down the street...and I PROMISE you'll love their fresh and delicious sushi!
0 ||| Went into get my brows waxed and was dissatisfied. The lady who did them was very rushed, like I was bothering her and she needed to do something else. She didn't ask me how I wanted my brows, just proceeded to slap on some wax and yanking the hair away. I ended up with brows that I'm not fond of because they are too thin, and to top it off, their price went up from the last time I was there. \n\nNo more visits there for me.
0 ||| I'm sorry, what? This place was the worst! First of all, it's a major dive in a thoroughly sketchy area (shares parking lot with really gross strip club and there's another one across the street.) The food is horrible! Horrible! Thick, bland, raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found. $4.35 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder. Fries were soggy and bland. Clams were bland as well, I've had frozen that were better. Cocktail sauce was even bland. Seriously, if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere.
