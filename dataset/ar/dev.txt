3 ||| This book should be required reading for anyone seeking to understand and deal with allergies and allergens that often plague us.
1 ||| I found it very difficult to fallow along since you can't always see everything the leader is doing.
3 ||| I was interested in this book in part because I'd heard of Bryher in connection with the poet H.D., and in part because it was recommended by the author of Reading Lolita in Tehran, Azar Nafisi, who, I figured, gets a lot out of her reading. She's definitely right about Visa for Avalon. It's half suspense/half political allegory, about several friends who belatedly realize that their (unnamed) country has been taken over by a totalitarian movement while they were involved in their own lives. They decide to leave for another country called Avalon, which they don't know much about, and set about to get visas and to get out before the borders shut down. It is beautifully written -- lyrical, observant, and concise. It reminds me a bit of Coetzee.The novel apparently draws on Bryher's experience in helping Jews escape the Nazis -- she lived in Switzerland in the early part of the war and helped many people escape Germany. And the book clearly resonates in the politics of the world today.
4 ||| Duquette imparts knowledge to the seeker with a sense of humor and common sense. Not really an essential book at all, but entertaining and intriguing. I prefer his other books, the Illustrated Geotia and The Magick of Aleister Crowley. This is more for the intermediate student. I am more advanced and I didn't get much out of this book aside from a few nice laughs.
2 ||| My son is just 8 months so though he is not walking with this on his own, he does hold onto it and walks a few steps with me holding onto him. He loves the sounds it makes and getting the balls out of the chutes to knock together. He has fallen off once but can sit on it comfortably. Not sure yet if it will get any use with it as a walker though, it does seem very low to the ground and he is already 29", so he may outgrow it before he can use it for its main purpose.
1 ||| Got this for my 12 yr old son and he's been using it but i dont think he is feally impressed with it.
1 ||| Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. "Cafe," for example, should be "Coffee." Despite the fact that the image for "Cafe" shows a stone or very light gray color, "Cafe" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.
4 ||| It is unfortunate that HBO hasn't researched the market for the going rate of episodic television programs on DVD. While I love "Six Feet Under", and have anxiously been awaiting the DVD set, I will have to re-think whether or not I can afford to shell out [$$$] for 13 episodes.
2 ||| This book had a great setup and premise: Amanda, whose son was missing for the last seven years, suddenly finds he's been raised by Garth, who erronously thought Amanda's son was his own. Her son is sick, and Garth wants to hold back on revealing the startling news about his parentage until he gets better.For the goodwill of their son, Garth and Amanda marry. However, it is unclear if this marriage will last since they've married for the son's health reasons.Garth, a non-believer, refuses to receive Amanda's Christ, which is cause for a big conflict, and a rift in their relationship.I thought this book was fairly good, but it did tend to drag in a few places. However, I would definately consider reading other books by this author.
4 ||| just finished "Death du jour and all i can stay is move over Cornwall, Reichs is here. what a read. read her first book "Deja Dead, it was great but she is getting better. this is the kind of book to read on a hot day to cool down. can't wait to find out more aboutTempe and her cat, Birdie.
1 ||| If you'd like to learn the entire hierarchy of old native american and Latin american cultures than this is the book for you. Dispersed facts about each culture that could be interesting if tied together and actually filled the book make it worth perusing. However, the book is entirely too long and filled with drivel consistent with reading a list of kings for every country in Europe for the last 3,000 years. Information about each king would be written out and spoken as fact, though when the source behind the information is given you begin forming some serious doubts about the authenticity of it all.
4 ||| I have to say that I have read all of Ms. Garwood's books and by far this one is my favorite. I have read it over several times and still love it each and every time!
3 ||| After reading this short review, please read on. The other reviewers will tell you some info that might be useful to you.My review is short for two reasons: 1) Blade Runner is one great movie, despite the fact that this Director's Edition might not be your cup of tea. After all, the original - uncut - version is better because of (amongst other reasons or opinions) the consistency in the storyline. Nevertheless, this version is one for the people that have a weak spot for some movie titles and want a complete collection. 2) The great image quality, no doubt about that. It blasts any earlier version away and that makes it worth the price.I would have rated this new DVD version five stars if the same could be said of the sound quality, but unfortunately, it only has 2 channel sound.And yes, I will buy the other versions that will come up, too. Hopefully these will play on all speakers ... ;-)
2 ||| Bought two of this mouse almost a year ago for my wife and I. Wife who uses her mouse far more heavily for gaming and general use, has noticed the pointer is not responding or moving correctly when clicking the left button. Either doesn't respond to the click at all, or responds slowly and sticks, most noticeable when trying to highlight text and suddenly a whole paragraph gets highlighted and deleted. Been a nice mouse to have prior to this, but looking at its short lifespan, not worth the expense.
0 ||| This book was a great disappointment. The story line is completely rediculous. I only finished reading it, because I wanted to know if it would get any better, but alas it didn't. I use this book as an example for a bad book, if somebody asks me.plot - I guess Dirk is a superhero, he dodges every attack story line - can it get any more stereotyped?Never Clive for me again.
4 ||| Did anyone else notice that the idiot named "gnossie" didn't read the book? What a moron.
4 ||| I can watch this over and over again. I had to wait for it to come on tv until I finally bought it
1 ||| It is a beautiful castle after it is put together...but shame on Mattel for terrible, blurry, vague instructions! The canopy/footboard fall down everytime. The Kelly bed keeps breaking off! My 4 year old gets angry bc everything falls over! Mattel could have done much, much better! Not a great toy.
3 ||| Purchased this for my 15 year old son. He found this shoe online thru another website but it was not available in his size. He likes the color of the shoe and the way it fits.My son has very wide feet so shoes that fit well that he likes the style of are hard to find. His feet also tend to sweat so needs "breathable" shoes.We did have a problem with the shoe about 2 weeks after wearing the shoe one of the shoes the "tongue" separated completely from the other part of the shoe.The return period had just ended but the Amazon representative was very helpful. She sent out a new pair at no charge, we then shipped back the defective pair using a return label at no charge.Only problem we had was that we only found two retailers with this shoe and only one with this size, even in the reebok store online and at the store in person.
2 ||| The premise of this book is a fascinating one: How people are living after a world war that took place between the US and China.The stories of each character were explored very well. The gripping part was when the subs search around the Northern Hemispheres for survivors. When they found none, everyone accepted the inevitability that the world would end.It was interesting to read Shute's idea of how the general population would act when they all knew that they were going to die. I think the movie better portrayed the anarchy that was going on around the major cities of Australia.
1 ||| This recording is pretty mediocre. It's OK. If you are looking for recordings by the French band of the same name, look elsewhere. This is a different band.
2 ||| I have medium thick hair with natural body. I love how this worked, BUT I've been through 2 so far, shopping for a third. They overheat too easily. My first burnt out in the first use so I returned it to the store. The 2nd lasted about 2 years. The internal fuse would blow after almost every use,then come back on later and I never used it on HIGH. This time, I'm buyingConair Infiniti Pro Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Styler Straightener. It has 2 rows of ceramic teeth and looks a bit sturdier. We'll see.
3 ||| This book is great! Love the pictures as well as the message a beautiful book, great positive message; shown through the eyes of a young African American boy with his dad along side. Beautiful!
4 ||| I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. They wash and dry well and do exactly the job they should.....protecting pillows and mattresses.
1 ||| I started watching Twilight because of my gf, I thought they're "OK", but this one is horrible. The whole baby thing was weird.And I noticed in so many scenes where no one was talking! Just pure silence!! o.OI usually like this kind of movies, about Vampires and all that.. So I started watching Vampire Diaries, it's waaaay better! From Acting/Actors, to music, to quality! Anyway, this is a Twilight review, and here it is.
1 ||| These type of movies had little to do with Christmas other than making a quick buck.Not many people knew at the time that Bing Crosby was a child abuser. Three of his children would eventually commit suicide.
3 ||| A decent priced case for my first gun. Easily fit a 9mm Sig, along with a mag and 2x50 round boxes. Wasn't looking for anything fancy, and it delivered just what I was looking for.
4 ||| My daughter wanted this movie for Christmas and it made her xmas so much better. We both love this movie so much. Amazon has great stuff for a great price!
1 ||| The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book.
1 ||| Kevin Smith writes a "grown up" script that is almost Disney, Ben Affleck squanders his talents yet again (the guy has a brain, why does he only play stern or endearing? or loutish.) Affleck's character acts grown up (conservative, altruistic) at a moment in his real life when he was really struggling with growing up issues (ie settling down with jHo), which makes this film interesting only as an artifact of tabloid culture. The people who made this film are too happy to be interesting.
4 ||| Rooted in the soil of South africa and flowering under a japanese sun this book is like a collection of separate stories brought together in a unified theme of cultural misunderstanding. The childlike Hara, an archetypical japanese camp beast, his noble officer immovable as a rock, Celliers the unbreakable stiff upper lipped british officer and between them all, trying to make some kind of sense, the liberal figure of Lawerence. The stories of youth in South Africa and the growing appreciation of the tall athletic son for his grotesque brother who has hands that are the soul of Africa, who finds life where others see only death, a man who knows what Isac Denisen calls the Song of Africa. Magical stuff!
0 ||| There is no structure, logic or historical context to any of his material. It rambles all over the place skipping from one subject to another in the same paragraph. If you like reading an editorial version of history you will love this book. This book is incredibly shallow and my evaluation of this book is that it is absolute [junk].
1 ||| Normally 8 or 8.5 fits my feet. But the leather of this shoes is too rough. I first ordered 8.5 and I return it to replace by 9. Even the size 9 is like a blade in my feet. When walking I feel scratching my feet but it looks very good. Make sure you order one bigger that your size.
4 ||| This incredible book is a gem. Filled with black and white illustrations from the period in question, the fashion plates, drawings, caricatures, and portraits help create a strong sense of the 19th century. This book follows the gradual changes and shows the overall shape of each chunk of time in the form of silhouettes (The author prefaces each section with a gray on white figure outlining the nature of that time's costume). While this book may be out of print, it is well worth the search if your passion is costume history through primary resources, particularly that of the 19th century. The approach is purely pictorial, but if what you want to know is the look, this book is excellent.
1 ||| I loved Coldplay's other two albums, but I have never heard such crap! I am ashamed to say that it is not worth the money. He sings out of tune and can't harmonize for crap! Five stars come on people...rate the CD not the Band!
3 ||| I've looked at just about every poker chip set out there in regards to getting a cheap workable set that doesn't look like crap. If that is what you want these are them. The case is of little value but will hold your chips. The chips are a perfect weight and I found no printing issues. Throw the cards out and get Copaq ones.
1 ||| The quality of cotton used on this product is not good. It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles, despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press+wrinkle guard setting. I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product.
4 ||| I bought this series remembering it from the Toonami block, and because I couldn't find a legit set of Cowboy Bebop. Outlaw Star, however, is just about as good. It details the exploits of Gene Starwind and his motley crew while being chased by space pirates, trying to make a living, and trying to find the Galactic Leyline. Plenty of action and the chemistry between Gene and Jim is great. My only complaint was Aisha Clan-Clan. She was annoying.
4 ||| WOW. Great remastered sound. The 2nd CD has a great blend of remix (extended) songs and live versions. As always great music.
4 ||| This book was written in a great way. The author keeps you imprisined and you can't get away. I fell in love with the caractors right away.I don't know what it is, but Christopher Paolini had me reading this book all night from 7p.m. to 6a.m. just to find out how it ends. Because of that I was late for school and got a F- on my test because I all i did was write my name and then I fell asleep and I slept, from 9a.m.-12p.m., utill lunch. But I didn't care because I finished the best book ever.You may think this book was predictable, but it wasn't compared to other books. For example in The Lord of the Rings Frodo was obviously going to deystroy the ring, Aragon was going to become king, and eveyone would live happily ever after. And also, people say this book is just like the Lord of the Rings well most action fantasys are, but who cares as long as it's a good book. Superb work Christopher Paolini! I give you an A+! Keep it up!
4 ||| Celtic music like you have never heard it!One of the most creative and adventurous recordings I have heard (which also means: Purists Beware). This is Celtic music but is hybrid and transcendent.The first (and title) cut involves dueling electric guitar and bombard, voices samples or other "found" effects, heavy percussion, superb musicianship, and remarkable tunes; all of which should tell you what you need to know about this marvelous recording. And there is more to come as you listen ("Kerminy Breo" is guaranteed to be a tune you can not get out of your head). Most highly recommended. Youenn Le Berre and Robert Le Gall are brilliant.
3 ||| This is not my favorite book. I don't like the pictures and the flaps are flimsy. But this book has something my daughter loves. She picks it every time. She loves finding Stretch in every picture and is thoroughly entertained by the story. If only I didn't have to suffer through it! We bought it when she was one and she's now two and still wants it read to her.
3 ||| It is a good album, not an amazing surround effect but it does something, it has breathtaking high fidelity by the way, the bonus track of Candle in the Wind (Acoustic) makes this album worth every cent, the voice is So Clear, and the acoustic guitars Oh my...!, the rest of the disc is good, three or four songs are not exactly my kind of music but the slow songs are excellent to enjoy both, great music and great audio quality. This disc is not expensive, buy it and you won't regret.
3 ||| Certainly not a book for an ambitious manager in a hurry, but for guys who can lean back for a few hours and have time to contemplate: it's a very good read.Landes' focus is very big business. But standing back - the patterns he describes are applicable to all kinds of families and - presumably - concern most of us.Landes describes these family patterns extremely well, looks closely at religious aspects too. It's this comprehensive view which renders his book so interesting.
3 ||| I am falling in love with "Steeple Hill Cafe!!!" This is just one of the books by this publisher that I have enjoyed reading as a Christian SAHM.I applaud Meredith in her ability to portray different mothering styles. I laughed out loud at many of what these moms thought they were doing "right"! Many topics hit close to home, especially humility....yeah! gotta keep working on that one!I also admire Meredith for completing this work. I too am a homeschooling mom and adoptive mom, and don't know how she has done it....Thanks!!!
2 ||| I gotta say that I was a little bit dissapointed in this book. I really liked the descriptions of the places and how colorful and vivid it all seemed. The part that made me dissapointed was when they left the island. The woman was a basket case and was very rude to people for little to no reason and I don't see how the men would have ever truly tolerated that. Once the left the island and the resort it went down hill and I found myself wishing for the rest of the book that they would go back and I was waiting for that moment and it never came. It was good but certainly not great.
2 ||| It's an O.K. movie, but the effects look so fake! I've seen 20 year old movies with better animation than that seen on the Scorpion King scenes! It just goes on and on and makes you wonder when it's going to end.
0 ||| This is the first John Tesh cd for me to buy and it will probably be the last, stay tuned. On this cd John doesn't place himself in a position to really shine as a soloist. He uses guitar and some other electroinic sounds which keep his performanace at bay. I have grown accustomed to listing to soloist that can give command performances. This performance of Johns' is a bit shy of what I would call a command performance.My advise to John would be to cultivate his performing skills more to where he could possibly become a great soloist. I know it is a lot harder to performn as a soloist, but these performance are more than worth all that hard work.I Can Not Recommend This Cd
2 ||| Works fine but a bit expensive so I'm only giving it 3 stars. I got it because I had a just a few dollars left on a gift certificate and we needed a corer. Otherwise I would have gotten a much cheaper brand.
3 ||| My husband and I bought this CB for our son who is a professional trucker. He said that it is a very good radio and he's well pleased with it. It has good sound quality and suits his needs very well. He plans to have a radio shop boost the signal to reach out farther, but even at the range it has now it is a great radio.
4 ||| Good product at an unbeatable price. I couldn't find a decent USB cable anywhere for a decent and reasonable price. Those thieves at RadioShack charge $30 for one, Best Buy same. That's a joke. So, i was happy I found this at Amazon.
4 ||| Being particularly fond of lengthy series, Robert Jordan delivers the goods. I didn't find out about the series until the eighth volume, but when I did I couldn't put them down. Just when the story gets you focused on one character, the perspective changes in such a way that another character is the central figure. I especially enjoy when they interract. I am also looking forward to the illumination to the allusions of this world perhaps being a time in our own very distant future (light bulbs, airplanes, even the original names of their notable historical figures). I can't wait to see where it's all going and am looking forward to ride.
1 ||| Well, I personally think that the book is too broad. It tries to conver everything which should be left to separate books. I was expecting to get good details on tuning web servers / capacity planning etc but instead just re-read stuff that is in other books. The chapter on capacity planning is decent as well as the appendicies. However these should have been the core of the book. If you are a beginner to the Internet and want to know general performance stuff get it. If you are more of a veteren don't buy it.
2 ||| This chapter features Jason in a short role but a coroner,cop,and newsman are the killers taking over Jason.it starts when Jason is blown to pieces by the SWAT and FBI,so when a coroner eats Jason's heart,the coroner starts Jason's usual murders,then the coroner puts a worm of Jason in people.this one has some extreme deaths like cuts a woman in half is explicit in Unrated version,and a woman has her head squeezed explicit in Unrated version.AWESOME MOVIE.
3 ||| We picked this dvd up for my son (8) and my daughter (2)a couple weeks back.When we all set down to watch it I had my doubts, but must say I was most pleasantly surprised! The special effects were very good, acting really solid and the story was pretty neat to. All yeah the scare factor for a kid's movie is up there to. My 2 year old would watch it white knuckled then turn around and laugh and cheer when it was over demanding it be put on again. And no nightmares!Well if you have a child who likes SiFi don't hesitate to get them this movie.
4 ||| Im not gonna say much, but this album is great. Del Shannon had a wonderful voice. My favorite is Out of Time. Even though there all good. I think anyone would be pleased if they bought this album.
2 ||| Imagine making a movie with not a hint of suspense or tension, just a macabre storm at sea in which ultimately everyone dies. The end.Movies like this are probably made simply to showcase the possibilities of CGI, a bit like Mummy 2. At least they didn't just sacrifice the black guy, like they do in most of these types of movies. And there's no dog to root for either.I liked the fact that they have a plump woman who is the object of one man's sexual desire. The people (even the big stars) looked real. They were not just Hollywood ugly (e.g., beautiful people wearing glasses) or Hollywood grimy (e.g., leading man with an eyepatch). The characters looked pretty battered.So there is a good sense of reality, but the story goes only one way, and all the CGI trickery in the world can't help the film from its storm of tedium.
1 ||| It did nothing for me! I have just bleached my hair and was looking for something "intense" but this isn't it! It really didn't help with smoothing or detangling, I wouldn't buy this, I much prefer 'it's a 10'.
4 ||| Slinky Malinki, the star of the story, creeps out of the house at night to look for the other cats in the neighbourhood to play. But what happens when Scarface Claw appears?A very cute book, written in the form of poetry, children learn all about rhyming words and various characteristics of cats.Lovely illustrations, adults would love this book as much as the children.
4 ||| This film was asked for by our residents (Assisted Living and Nursing Home). It was a favorite past classic, that was shown on TV, but no longer seems to make the Christmas Movies. The discussion group that followed, was wonderful. It really triggered many memories for our viewers.
1 ||| I had purchase this book before but not from Amazon. This edition is not what I had expected. I was looking for a student edition. Also this book had been wrtitten inside the pages
4 ||| Many young pianists have the manual skills and dexterity to master these pieces but . . . the feeling and interpretation that Ms Bardin brings to us here in nothing less than marvelous. She puts you in another world.
3 ||| can't let another day go by without writing about Fat Jon. I discovered his sound by accident. Actually, while buying some vinyl records online, I read a review about his production and took a chance on it. This is the bomb right here! In a a hip hop world where originality has faded to black, Fat Jon's style stands out from the rest. It's smooth beats to say the least, a laid back, mellow vibe perfect for late night drives on the Autobahn. Check out "Mystery God" and "Beyond Love" which are (in my opinion) two standout tracks on an exceptional album. If you're longing for vocals, this may not be for you. Let me mention that Fat Jon did some production work with a "neo-soul" artist named Venus Malone. Although very hard to find, that collaboration is worth looking for. Beat connoisseurs will have a heyday with Lightweight Heavy. It's sure to please!DJ Come of Age
0 ||| I thought this book was a waste of my time. it may have emotion... but it is riddled with chapters that contain little relevance to the plot! Save yourself and don't bother.
4 ||| I am loving this video. It is a great introduction to letter sounds. My daughter started with this when she turned three. We have bought all the dvds in the series. We used these in conjunction with Hooked on Phonics, Bob Books and some Scholastic Readers. She is 4 now and was just evaluated and is reading at a first grade level. My two year old son who has a hard time talking loves this video. If you draw each letter he will tell you the sound that goes with each one. That blows me away and it is all thanks to this DVD.If you don't have it, get it. And don't worry about those reviewers who said it teaches incorrect sounds. It's just not a factor. This DVD works and my two kids are proof of it.
3 ||| This album is crazy. wanye and mannie fresh do it again. Could have been a five but juvie is nowhere on there. but still itz hot
0 ||| 8 out of 10 for technos; 3 out of 10 for drama; 1 out of 10 for history. Besson's Joan is a raving vengeful femme and bears no resemblance to the real Joan of Arc, so well documented by dozens of scholars. Don't for one minute be fooled by his revisionist Joan; the real woman was a real star and a saint. I was left with a feeling of anger, as if a fraud had been perpetrated, because Besson's Joan simply cannot have achieved the heroism that the real Joan so patently did. Her trial and life are among the most well-documented of any historical figure, and Besson's Joan disavows or ignores what the best scholarship has long established. A modernist gothic horror it might be, but it's cheap cinema (because this Joan is just not credible) and even cheaper fiction. Don't infect your children with this a-history.
0 ||| First of all, I am a huge Halloween fan, I have the entire collection (including this one).This was the worst movie in the history of horror movie! It's very unrealistic. People can't turn into bugs and snakes! At least in Halloween 1, 2,4,5,6 and H20 Michael Myers was a "real" person.The thought that there is a serial killer is real, but this one, just sucked!It doesn't deserve the 1 star I gave it!
1 ||| I bought this movie for my grandchildren and was disappointed. I'm not sure why,but they didn't care much for this movie. They lost interest in it after only a few minutes. This movie, in my opinion, will not become one of Disney's "classics".
3 ||| It is hard to enjoy an entire book of ridiculous ranting and hysteria. Reilly's outbursts grow tiresome and repetitive. He maintains the same one-note level of disgust and anger throughout the book, and any personal growth that he achieves tends to be physical rather than spiritual or philosophical. British readers may find Reilly a mixture of several comic characters from Viz magazine - Spoiled Brat, Mr Brain - but Toole's real skill is in creating the various plot threads and drawing them together and flinging them apart at will. I was truly delighted that Ignatius gets away at the end of the book to wreak further havoc. What a pity that the author didn't.
1 ||| This was a true BEGINNERS video of yoga. It was very low quality in it's making, and the instructions were almost to easy. I felt that for the price it wasn't worth it at all. And the tape I purchased only played for 10 minutes and then started skipping and I couldn't stop it. All in all I wouldn't recommend it. I much prefer Yoga for Every body.
0 ||| These strips are nothing more than scotch tape in the shape of eyebrow removers. They may take off one or two hairs, but they don't come close to doing what they are supposed to.
4 ||| I loved it and am really glad to add it my collection.I ordered another copy and will give it to myGreat grandaughter in college.
2 ||| This is a great resource for someone who is looking for a very general perspective on Tai Chi. I was looking for something a little more specific. The book goes over a set of Yang 64 that I've never heard of very well in a step by step format and even comes with a cd. Unfortunatly I think the book wastes to much time talking about how to choose a style of Tai CHi and a school but its all information I did not find helpful and seemed more like filler.
0 ||| I am surprised at the high marks that some others gave this film. I found it slow and unexciting. Phoebe Cates brilliant? I hardly thought so. It was simply not my kind of film. You will know within 15 minutes whether it is for you or not. If you don't like it, turn it off, because it does not get any better.
2 ||| Not all that familiar with this artist.Seems like decent dance,house,club...whatever some call this genre these days.The remix of "Amazon","Fire Fire" and the seven-minute "Galang",I thought was good.No,this isn't even close to my favorite sort of music,but I thought I'd give it a listen.If you're the type of person that hangs out in dance clubs until 2am,you should dig 'Arular'.Might appeal to fans of Beyonce,Ciara and Missy Elliott.
3 ||| I have read almost all of five of the books in the Ender series and by far this is the best of them all. Ender's Game was a very good book and when I partly read the next two books I was seriously disappointed. They just had no imagination! Orson Scott Card makes up for this in a big way in the story line of Ender's Shadow and especially Shadow of the Hegemon. They bring back the true spirit of the series. This most recent one has to be one of the best science-fiction books as well as an overall war story that is futuristic but very believeable. Its only low point is the fact that as I have found with the entire series, it is really slow going, but once it starts it doesn't stop till the last page. This book is great! The letter near the end written by a nun to Bean is one of the most personally realistic few pages ever written in a book. Read Ender's Game, skip the next three and read the Shadow books. The next two books should make it a complete series.
0 ||| I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a movie. This was historically inaccurate beyond belief. It almost seemed like it was making Joan out to be the villain. If you want to see a good movie on Joan Of Arc, see the "Joan Of Arc" movie that was on TV.
2 ||| I've got a 1 year old Am Staff Terrier that tore this product apart in about 15 minutes. The entire item is still fairly intact, but the flaps that keep the treats inside were lost and recycled within minutes of him getting his paws on it. I gave 3 stars because the flaps are a little flimsy for strong chewers. I wish they made this product in the black Extreme line.
3 ||| Now I know why this movie is getting so much attention.I loved this movie, and I do understand why it has garnered so much attention and love from the public. It is very well made, and it kept me 'glued to the screen' from beginning to end. Anthony Piano plays the Narrator very well, and this film takes us through every major event in H. G.' book.Now I plan to re-read the book that this film is based on.This is an innovative, great movie.
1 ||| I had this book as a kid and it scared the crap out of me! The book's about a poor little lion who halucinates due to this terrible red medicine his mother insists on giving him. He has these terrifying visions of monsters and I really don't think this book is suitable for small children. Too scary!
0 ||| Windows ME is not what I expected. I wouldn't even give this product a 1 star rating(no other choices). It has crashed my computer so many times since I got the software, I've lost count. It is not worth the money you pay for it. Microsoft should give it away for free. Even then I wouldn't touch it. I'm going to enjoy deleting it when I get Windows 2000.
2 ||| A solid collection of lesser known titles that are definitely worth the price if you are a true Hitchcock fan. Image quality and extras are lacking when compared with your typical Criterion Collection dvd but for this price you can't complain.
0 ||| This book is a great example for teaching children about the pilgrims and everything they believed in such as religious freedom (except if you weren't a god fearing christian) and settling new frontiers (AKA conquering territory and making already settled people miserable) Hats off to the author for this book glorifying an essentially moronic culture.
4 ||| I fell into this film quite by accident. How fortunate for me. Oh that I had a fraction of the insight, talent and brilliance Landreth has shown here. Buy it, watch it, think about it and then watch it again. You will be amazed at the art and animation, and you'll be equally moved by the novel ways in which Landreth depicts the scars of the human journey.
0 ||| It's easy, there're only a few possibilities why you like this album:1. You're a little gal in your early teens, and u think he's, well, cute.2. You know zilch about music. You're trying to be a victim of the mushrooming commercial music that I'm so sick of.Did u ever feel a rush of blood oozing to your heart. NO? Then his songs probably dun impress you much.
3 ||| Jean Goldkette should be mentioned along with Paul Whiteman when people talk about the great white jazz bands of the 1920s. Besides his exciting arrangements, he was an innovator. When other bands used a tuba, Goldkette use a bass. And while other bands used a banjo, Goldkette had a guitar player. Another reason Goldkette's arrangement are recognizable: jazz violin solos. Many bands simply had the violinist in the background playing the main melody. Goldkette had Joe Venuti fiddling away. The only drawback to this recording is the haphazard use of noise reduction. Sometimes it's not there, other times it's in full force, and that causes a distraction from the great music.
1 ||| Predictable plot, sketchy locale, good dialogue, sterotypical characters individuated by anachronistic twentieth century quips in an otherwise medieval mileau. The author has written this book several times under different titles with re-named characters in various locales. Reminiscent of Heinlein's "Glory Road" without fully realized characters. If you haven't already read one of Lawrence Watt-Evan's books it's definitely worth the price, worth reading for enjoyment, not worth re-reading. If you have read one of his books you know what your getting. Buy it, if you want more of the same. I borrowed my copy.
0 ||| In my anxiousness to see this classic transformed into yet an even more special experience utilizing Blu-Ray technology, I foolishly purchased this disc. I am dissappointed to report that it was not worth spending the money. The technology is just not visible. It really is deceptive marketing and unnecessary. I suppose it is just not feasible to expect a movie made in the 30s to be greatly approved upon. Save your dinero and play your anniversary edition instead. Shame on MGM, shame on marketing execs and even shame on Amazon for misleading your faithful client base.
1 ||| "If it weren't for Sgt. Pepper, progressive rock would never have existed"?. I doubt it.This is an OK album with a few good tracks like A Day in the Life that can be had on the various greatest hits compilations without having to deal with songs like Within You Without You. 2-stars.
2 ||| Kids loved the movie, I did not enjoy buying a movie and waiting for buffering during viewing. So, I am hesitant to purchase rights to watch other on-line movies. It may have been an unusual occurance.
4 ||| I read almost all of these books many, many years ago and found them so interesting - am loving The Clan again, and will probably order the entire set in time. So nice not to have the usual voilence, although the primitives were sometimes pretty rough, but in a more natural way! Just lovely night-time reading whilst the hubby snores!!! So good to have something to read in the dark.
4 ||| This and, Tey's Brat Farrar, are two of the very best from the decades around WWII when British mystery writing was so good. Unlike many of the books by Dorothy Sayers, Marjorie Allingham or Ngaio Marsh, classics in their day, these two by Tey stand up well to the passage of time. The story of The Franchise Affair is timeless and the characters and local so beautifully written that the book is not dated at all. The modern reader can appreciate the difference in lifestyle in the post War time without feeling that it is too period or quaint. A fine story that is suspenseful even though the reader knows from the beginning how the tale will end.
4 ||| Beautiful movie. Very inspiring. Couldn't have imagined better actors for it, they were perfect! Healing is possible and things look up eventually, it's just a matter of perspective ;)
2 ||| Compared to a lot of other George Clinton endeavors (Maggot Brain by Funkadelic, Mothership Connection by Parliament), Computer Games is reasonably mediocre. There are some pretty good cuts, and of course, the hit song Atomic Dog, but it lacks any connecting element or storyline. You may groove a little in your chair listening to this cd, but it's nothing to get up and funk about.
1 ||| Once I opened the package, there was a terrible smell resembling decay/rotting fish that came from these. I tried to "air' them out to see if the smell would go away, only to have my next door neighbor tell me about a "dead animal smell" that she could smell all the way up from her 2nd floor apartment 300 feet away. Sure enough, I brought her over to where these were "aerating" and it was the culprit. (I guess the wind was blowing just right that day). I have purchased other products from this brand previously with no issues. But whatever this was, the smell was too awful to give to the dog.
1 ||| This was a very interesting movie about a British woman helping the Allies in occupied France during WWII. Fascinating story - unfortunately the tape kept pausing in our VCR and we missed quite a bit of the dialogue toward the end. I think the tape had been on the shelf too long. What a shame!
2 ||| The sound is fantastic. I just received these yesterday and am wearing them for the first time today. My job is in a quiet office so I'll be wearing headphones for the better part of the day and then on the bus home. Great sound and at first they fit great. I'm a small person (not as in dwarf, but petite) and the phones fit snugly on my ear. The cushion is comfy and I love how this item packs away. Its a must for my public transit riding life. But now its a couple of hours in and both my ears are getting pinched--the right moreso than the left for whatever reason. I'm hoping they will loosen up w/time. But yea, the sound is great! Fantastic bass and high end!
2 ||| If the 4th of July was every day, day in and day out, I think we would all get pretty dang sick of fireworks. That pretty much describes how I feel about Marquez and this book; it is a parade that lasts hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages, and an endless display of literary aesthetic achievements.If, however, you can remember back to the days of the "Where's the Beef?" ads, you might understand my irritation at a flawlessly written novel that lacks a cohesive idea - even a thread of one - to unify all the beauty contained therein. Is this book a masterpiece? Undoubtedly, for its perfection of style and flavor. Could it have been more? Could Marquez have added substance to his style? Much more?Sadly, yes.
2 ||| Personally, I was disappointed with these books. They scared me a little, but that was mostly the pictures. I also was not super impressed with the writing. It dragged a lot and made me fall asleep during our Sustained Silent Reading periods (SSR). I really do think that the movie is better because I think it isn't as scary and is funnier. I did think that these books would have been good for their time period, but I just don't think that they appeal to kids now.
1 ||| The DVD is completely in Spanish... that is a plus. "Vamos a Cantar" which means "Let's sing" and that it is what the DVD is all about. The DVD is song after song after song. To me most of the songs are not even catchy to kids. If your kids want a Plaza Sesamo music video DVD this is what you are looking for.
1 ||| I guess I was looking for a movie to pass the time... What I ended up doing was reading a magazine while half-watching/listening to this movie. The plot is rather unbelieveable even for sci-fi... Not consistent sci-fi. The acting is terrible... I was very dissappointed with Jason Stratham's performance after seeing him in Snatch. Jet Li should stick to martial arts, and not acting... I'm not a fan of Jet Li per se, but I do like good action. Some of the special effect fight scenes were great, and makes me recommend this for a rental... Or if you're really into Jet Li movies. Otherwise keep this ONE off your list. Seemed like it was too much of a "promotion" movie... Promote Jet Li since he's at a high point, Promote "the next matrix" style effects, and to promote "Disturbed's" new album. Just my two cents.
0 ||| Dana and Mantey know little about Greek grammar. This is one of the worst grammars available, no matter how easy it is to read it is bad grammar.
2 ||| Well I was very excited about this book when I first ordered it and I was really looking forward to reading it. Well It was a good book but I didn't think it lived up to the recommendations it has had. It was a bit slow throughout the book. I liked the fact that the Heor Malcolm MacFane aka the Black Wolf is not super strong but has had major injuries to overcome. I actually liked him and his friend Gavin much better than the heroine in the book, Ariella. At first I thought she would be a wonderful heroine, strong and willful but loyal and caring to her clam and to the injured Black Wolf whom she was to have been married to. Even though she helps ease his physical pain she doesn't seem to interested in helping him heal his emotional pain. She seems very cold to me. The other characters in the book make it very funny at times. The training scenes and the two old men are very humorous. All in all I would say its a good read but it could have been so much better.
4 ||| I bought two of these for kids #2 and #3 for Christmas.They were off and running on these right out of the box. Of course, they use these in PE at school, so they are not novices.They are using these on the neighborhood concrete driveways and sidewalks. I do not see where there will be a wheel wear issue on this type of surface, but I could see how wheels would get worn down quickly on any rough stuff.If you are an old geezer, like me, with decent balance and athletic ability, you will enjoy using the wave board too. It took me about 20 minutes of practice to be able to get the hang of it and not look like a complete dork.As always, Amazon came through and shipped quickly with no hassles.
3 ||| Am I alone in the onion patch? Why isn't one of Mr Godfrey's most evocative tunes present on this - or any - available CD collection. Please, somebody in the business get your act together - gives us I'm A Lonely Petunia In An Onion Patch (fee-yew!).
3 ||| My parents have used this program literally my entire life. My mom used this book to loose the baby weight from carrying me. As kids we ate the dinner menus everyday, so much so that I still find myself making BBQ chicken with green beans on Thursdays. I gave this book 4 stars because it is slightly dated. However, I love the program as a whole because if I want to lose a pound a day, I know I can always use "Scars" as my family and I lovingly refer to it. Everyone in my immediate family has this book, we love it!
4 ||| This icemaker churns out a full bucket of ice in less than 24 hours. Very easy to install, my only comment is that it doesn't mention anything about the copper pipe in the initial required materials and isn't mentioned until the appendix.
0 ||| I have to agree with the masses. This movie is a total bore. The repetitive spoofs back to back to back are oh so annoying. My attention drifted away from this garbage and I startd surfing the net.Not only were the jokes bad but they were gross and unpleasant and demeaning. Even Allsion Harrigan as a thin person was not too pleasing to view on the screen. And the scene where the couple roll a drunk like its the thing to do is so mean spirited.Avoid at all costs. The people have properly spoken.
4 ||| In comparison to Trojan, Durex, and other major condom brands, these win hands down. They're the thinnest I've had, and the most dependable.
3 ||| A young religious scholar takes time out to visit a friend. While he is in town, he meets a very seductive woman with one thrill -- to secure a soul.
0 ||| Seller claimed to be selling the complete season of Six Feet Under. I received the 4th disc of the first season. DVD was in bad shape. Not satisfied.
0 ||| Whenever you see a bunch of good reviews and then a 1 star critical review, pay particular attention to the 1-star review.This book is 40 pages of "ok" material and 10 pages of advertisement and table of contents.How about pricing it at 10 cents a page for a total of $4.00 because that is all that it is worth.I recommend buying a copy, spending 10 minutes to xerox it (the fact that all the pages are 8 1/2 x 11 and the book isn't hardcover should facilitate this), and then returning the sucker.Sorry, I know that there is this egregious greed mentality in selling "trading books" by gouging consumers, but this one crosses the line.
1 ||| This album is a huge disappointment.The first album was a classic, but this one just seems hastily thrown together and half-hearted. And G-Love has gone all sugary pop on "Dreamin" & "Rodeo Clowns". What's goin' on ? Next thing we'll hear he'll be dueting with Britney Spears ! They are a great live band though, but their fat live sound isn't captured on here at all. The best advice - don't buy this album, just wait to see the band live - you'll get better value for money !
1 ||| I gave this two stars because it was not well put together. Seeing the trailer, it looks like great movie but after I saw it, I was bitterly disappointed because the movie was all over the place, poor character development, no chemistry, random scenes. It's supposed to be a love story right? Or at least I expected it to be, but the relationship between Ronnie and Will is not any different from everyday life that you see with teenagers. Everything felt forced. What is good about this movie?--The movie trailor, the movie cover, the music video, beautiful people, and the scenery. It would have been alot better if she sang a song in the movie or something. There wasn't anything special about this movie. ...
0 ||| Man, what was I thinking when I saw this movie?! I mean, from the previews and such, I thought that "The Pledge" was going to be a really good movie. But now, when I saw it on DVD, I began to question myself as to why Jack Nicholson even bothered to make this movie. I haven't seen Nicholson ever since "As Good As It Gets" and really, I just have to say, "Why, Jack?!" I've seen better Jack Nicholson movies than this, such as "As Good As It Gets", "Batman", "Wolf", and "The Crossing Guard". But "The Pledge" has to be among the worst ones. And I really don't know what to say about Sean Penn's directing in this film right now. In conclusion, this movie may be great for renting, but it is not great to own, whether it's on video or DVD! And by the way, "The Pledge"? Looks more like "The Plunge" if you ask me.
1 ||| In 1988, British gay novelist Alan Hollinghurst made a striking debut with "The Swimming Pool Library." Set in the Darwinian landscape of pre-AIDS homo London, the writing was beautiful and urgent, flaring at times to real poetry, while the characters exerted the pull of infatuation. I reached the end of that book resenting the forced separation and wanting to hang out with the whole lot for a lot longer.Since then, each subsequent Hollinghurst novel has been more disappointing than the last. In the latest, "The Line of Beauty," his literary go-cart has come nearly to a halt. The writing is still elegant, studded with memorable turns, but the story is utterly without consequence, ditto the characters. Is Hollinghurst writing or doing his nails? Verdict: don't bother.
1 ||| This system is horrid. Not only have I had problems with it skipping, pausing, and completely freezing, but so has a friend of mine with the same system. I dont recomend this product to anyone unless you dont mind a great movie skipping, pausing out for a second or so, or completely freezing up on you. I personally find it very frustrating. The sound is decent for the little money, but this skipping, pausing, and freezing is enough to make you want to throw your new machine in the trash.
0 ||| I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!
3 ||| This is the best gangster game I have ever seen! The only reason it is not a five star is the fact that it is hard to get started with. But once you get the hang of it is easy! With scenerios and long game it ranks the best game i have! For additional help get the Prima Strategy Guide.
4 ||| The Outsider is a very good movie.. action, romance, and Tim Daly is extremly hot in this movie!
4 ||| I'm not 7th Day Adventist, but loved this book anyway. God instituted a day of rest at creation. If He rested I guess we should too. Since He did create us He would know what was best for us.
1 ||| The idea and the book was a great. I found her gutter language was totally unnecessary. There are so many beautiful words in the English language. Too bad she does not use them.
1 ||| I am genuinely baffled by the degree of devotion this book still inspires based on the reviews at this site. I remember trying this book as a girl and disliking it; I gave it another try now on vacation, at the age of 47. I still dislike it. The characters are caricatures and speak in stilted dialogue unlike that of any real people--much less interesting people. Don't misunderstand--I like good nineteenth century novels. In fact, I love Dickens, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, etc. This book is a pale imitation of those--a mere period piece.
0 ||| Let's face it if this show hadn't starred Python alumnus John Cleese this show would be as famous as Mind your Language.
0 ||| Perhaps her cause was just in writing this book, but her short-sighted ignorance of the repercussions was inexcusable. Because of the ban on DDT which largely resulted from Silent Spring, the WHO has estimated that around 20 MILLION children have died of malaria.DDT was, & still is, one of the very best insecticides to control mosquitoes, the sole transporter of this deadly disease. Best of all, DDT is very NON-toxic to humans.The need for DDT is so urgent that even the Sierra Club is justifying it's use inside houses in malaria stricken locations of Africa, South America, & Asia.Way to go Rachel. Save the Birds, Kill the Children...Wake Up People!!
1 ||| Seems when they ship these, they all have melted, the 'cookie' part has sank down to one side of the bar, and you wonder if they know that you can't store these in a 130 degree warehouse.Overall you buy these for something to eat when you want protein/carbs due to training. You can get that from these, but don't expect great taste. If the whole bar was covered like it was supposed to be, then these would be great. Otherwise 1/5th of the bar is good, the rest is dry and chalky.Eat them if you have too, but otherwise look for something else.
0 ||| No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period.
4 ||| Other brands just don't cut it, Dunlop double dot is the only ball I play with.
3 ||| Ok, here's the thing (and it's a trend I've noticed among all Dorris's reviews, you need to have faith that the read will be worth the time spent. It took me a couple months of looking at it in my bookshelf before I got around to reading, and even then I found the language easy and the plot somewhat entertaining. The thing you will notice is that its quite a long read and the book, broke into 3 sections, will most likely scare you away when you find tedium in some of the passages. I stuck with it (out of respect for Erdrich's choice of husband) and found that the last two sections really sold my interest into the story, as all the loopholes are backfilled and twists in plot are revealed. My first cynical impressions at the beginning were all destroyed and I found the characters more sympathetic and relatable. Give the book a chance, it was a wonderful finish, and it was nice to read fiction that taught me something valuable.
4 ||| This is not an ordinary SF story. It is social philosophy with depth, new thinking about old ideas and fascinating portraits of persons involved. The science is not bad either. I was riveted to my Kindle every day when commuting until finished. Highly recommended.
3 ||| One of the most underated singers in pop or rock.Curt has a lot of talent ,a lot of people think that Roland was Tears For Fears alone, granted he is a great songwriter and guitarist but he missed something when Curt left hopefully the last album from a few years ago won't be there last.as for this album it is a pretty good album and a shame that it's out of print as you see it going for $50 as an import.the best songs are Calling Out which was a single great song,Soul On Board,and Beautiful To Me which sounds like a Peter Gabriel song great vocals by Curt,Words also could of been a hit good song, the worst song is the last one Come The Revolution which has some annoying raps on it.not a classic album but worth having just for the few songs I mentioned.the record Curt made with a rock band Mayfield was a better album also hard to find but good to add to your Tears For Fears collection.
3 ||| This has been a great addition to my kitchen- we like to reuse all of our ziplocs and covermates (shower cap for leftovers) and drying them was always tricky. Not anymore. This stand is great, hardly takes up any room. The only problem- as others have mentioned- is that it is very lightweight so it will topple over easily. One friend just drilled it into a heavy peice of wood for a base while we chose to glue it to an old, heavy ceramic coaster to give it some balance. If they fixed that, they would have a perfect product. Having said that, I am ordering one as a christmas present right now!
1 ||| Dodgball has the formula to be a classic. What can be funnier than seeing a bunch of people get pelted with red rubber balls? But somewhere during execution, the film lost whatever magic it may have had. Ben Stiller's character is like a lame version of Zoolander, that tries to be funny, but fails horribly. Vince Vaughn is also not funny and not a likeable character along with his crew of strange outcasts of life. When they got Ben and Vince against each other, I could care less who won.Simple movie goers may like this film, but people looking for a comedy that's more than just stupid one liners (that aren't even good.) Dodgeball does not deliver. When I went to see this movie I expected nothing from it, and I got less. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of a few cheap laughs it had that actualy were successful, other than that, it was a complete failure. One of the worst movies of 2004.
4 ||| This workout is execllent for toning. If a person is trying to lose weight, I would recommend to combine it with aerobics and weight training exercises. One important thing to keep in mind is that this dvd is not for beginners or people who are new to yoga. Sarah Ivanhoe is one of my favorite instructer, and her cueing is perfect. After sometime you don't need to look at the tv screen..
1 ||| Since Outside, Bowie became the new techno-jungle king, a vanguardist that push up the system with rupturists sounds. Earthling was his best album in the whole 90s, without a doubt. Hours was supposed to be the continuation of that new born man Bowie has made of himself, that one with orange hair and sensual voice, dressed in an England-flag suit, doing videos with Trent Reznor and all that stuff. But Hours is no more than a man revisiting his decadent past in the 80s, with boring and extremely long and dull songs. His voice dosent soud the same anymore; this time it is still and fakely high-toned. The new age aura of Thrursday Child doesent help very much (and the awful video neither). The only good song here is the not very original Whats really happening and Your pretty things are going to hell. The rest soud like Sting or something worse.-
0 ||| I am in the process of changing all of my movies from VCR Casettes to DVD becausse my player for the cassettes broke and cannot be replaced. I had the VCR version of this already. Don't know who made the mistake
3 ||| No fluff, but if you want something that holds up it does the job. It will carry a fair amount and allows for easy access to your files.
1 ||| I bought a brand new Roadtrek Motorhome that came equipped with this unit. It was hooked up to a TV antenna and a DVD player and Dolby Surround Sound, but had room for several more component and HD connections.It worked nicely with the integrated system in the Motorhome... for about 10 minutes. It died, no power whatsoever. I tried outside power, etc., no help.I tried the Samsung website to register it, but it was a Canadian model (where the Motorhome was built), and I couldn't register it on the US site, nor could I register it on the Canadian site since it only allows you to enter Provinces, not States.However, I did call Samsung the next day, they asked for the Serial Number, and that was all it took for them to send a replacement to a local UPS store. Alas, my trip is already planned, so I won't get it till I return, but I am very pleased with the Customer Service and only hope the next unit (re manufactured) works.
0 ||| After a few months use the batteries quit charging. Good concept but lousy product. A waste of your money.
1 ||| Oxo Good Grips Uplift Teakettle, Brushed Stainless SteelI bought the green enamel Oxo Good Grips Uplift Tea Kettle 2 Qt. capacity less than 6 months back. I use it daily to boil water for cooking. I take good care of it- keep it clean and dry when not in use. Unfortunately, it has began rusting inside where the spout meets the kettle. This is definitely not worth the money.2 stars for the good looks and the comfy handle.
0 ||| Type this author's name in the amazon search and see what comes up: nothing but books about how writers can get published. I.E. if you want to make a living as writer, then write books that gullible people will buy. If this person is unable to get their work, other than books about getting published, published then it's self evident that one should not take the advice in his books seriously, there is no evidence that it works for anything but books about how to get published (or, it may be seen, he has, technically, published two books about how to make it through college as a student, something that is minimally useful and, also, seems to have gone out of print quite rapidly, i.e. did not sell well).Unless, of course, your only desire is to write books about how to get published, then you should take his advice, in such a particular case as that he seems to know what he's talking about.
1 ||| It's ok for a few hours, after that, use cheat codes to open up the better cars and tracks, play for a few more hours,But after all that I thought it was a average game with some control problems with the cars, it actually mimics R/C cars to well, and the AI was alot faster than most players can keep up with so expect to win only a few tracks. A few bugs, but not serious ones.
3 ||| This book got me hooked on David Thompson, I would have rated it with a 5 except it like all his books in this series are too short. They are like chapters not a real book. You just git into it and the book ends. I have bought 6 of his books or chapters and will not buy any more and there are about 64 in this series. I really like his writing but he needs to write a book not a series of chapters. The world is changing he, the author needs to keep up, every one is going to Ebooks, these are not available for ebooks.
1 ||| This is my first Magic School Bus tape and I am disappointed. It is not about sports but about friction,how the body system works together etc.If you are looking for an educational tape about sports this is not it.Also the teacher and students talk real fast in the tape making it hard for very young learners.I ordered the one on the human body and space adventures I hope they are what they say they are.
0 ||| I made the mistake of purchasing a large quantity of these on sale instead of trying a few to see if we liked them first. Now, I'm stuck with 97 condoms that are all but useless. Maybe we'll have a balloon party.First of all, the packages can be difficult to gain access to. I wasn't intoxicated while using these, but they are more difficult to open than our usual durex and sometimes magnums.The fit on these is tight, specifically the girth. While the material is very thin, I can feel the restriction and it is distracting. The length is average and adequate.Worst of all, these lost all lubrications in 5-10 minutes. Twice I had to apply extra lubrication (think baby powder dry) and the most recent time I just gave up and called it a night.Shipping was fairly prompt from the seller, but the questionable packaging, small fit (must have done their product testing in Asia) and extreme lack of lubrication make these the worst condom I have ever used.
0 ||| I have filed a claim for a refund. The book was never received and the seller did not respond to my 3 emails.
0 ||| Shipping was fast, packaging wasn't damaged when received. The DVD player out of the box just doesn't work. Sometimes it won't even register that there's a DVD in the drive, sometimes it'll load it up and then just lose the DVD, stopping all playing. Only one in every ten DVDs will be successful in playing and it's a cross-your-fingers situation with it finishing the entire movie. This has happened since the first disc was put into the system and a few of the DVDs I've tested have been brand new. Perhaps this is just my luck, but from my experience I'm saying: Do not purchase this product.
3 ||| This book started out in a way that I could not put it down. It was a very interesting and well written beginning. Unfortunately, the narrative broke down a bit towards the end. I was able to predict what was happening about 100 pages before everything was explained. To me this lessens the quality of the book.However, much of the information on psychology given in the book was absolutely fascinating since I do not have any sort of background in it.
3 ||| Shakespeare's play King Henry includes comedy, history, and passion. You may find yourself to side with the rebels and cheer on Lord Percy. The only downside to reading Henry IV part one, is that you might have to do your homework to understand what is going on in this era. After reading this play, go see it in the theater if you can!
0 ||| Definitely the worst I've seen in the Exam Cram series. It looks like it was rushed to meet a dateline and I cannot believe that there was any technical review. Don't take my word for it just go through 10-20 questions of any of the exams at your local bookstore and you probably agree with my assessment. Ironically though that process might help you learn. Personally I would NOT recommend this book as I don't want to encourage such sloppiness.
3 ||| these are the nighttime go-to diapers. very seldom is there a leak. they fit well and do the job very well.
1 ||| We purchased this unit about 3 weeks ago and noticed the very first day how incredibly hot this unit gets! We have only watched about 4 movies on it so far, but every time we do it gets very hot in the base near the AC/DC adapter, and the last time we used it, very hot in the upper left corner above the screen. It works fine so far, although the volume could be louder on the speakers. I cannot believe that it is good for the unit to operate at these temperatures, and with all of the bad reviews, I plan on trying to return mine to Wal-Mart.
2 ||| I listened to the title track repeated on my car CD for 2 hours straight, and it's a gem, but the rest of the CD isn't as consistently good as the Lucinda Williams CD (with Crescent City). Her edge though makes me buy everything she does though because no one else has her groove.
1 ||| The wording was a bit too antique for my liking. The storyline was good but I was disappointed in this book.
1 ||| What was Oprah thinking recommending this. The story is just as depressing as the picture of the author on the cover. I did not enjoy this at all.
4 ||| This Bible is great when for carrying around. It looks cool and even has red-lettering for a pocket Bible. It's a great Bible and I recommend it to anyone.
3 ||| The acting is cringe-inducing, but my 3yo requests to see ALL the time. So, on the basis of my son's frequent requests, I give it four stars. Your toddler(s) will probably love it, the adults will just have to suffer through.
0 ||| I am a Vietnam Special Forces Veteran, I served my Country from 1965- 1967 in Vietnam..... I have witnessed various horrors during those teribble times Therefore I consider myself a fair judge of Vietnam motion pictures... I can tell you that I watched various films about the Vietnam War, Platoon, Full metal Jacket, and what I believe came closest to the way it wasWas, We were Soldiers..........I have just seen Apocalypse......WHAT A BUNCH OF BULL......... Vietnam was nothing like this!!!!!!!!!Ask any Vietnam Veteran......This contribed story should be packaged with some of the Disney Classics......it just a silly fantasy or a bad LSD Trip.....it just does not tell the truth of what the Vietnam Experience was like, If you are truly Interested in seeing what it was like, please watch one of the other fore menchioned movies..their far more accurate ........
1 ||| I usually read a book this size in two days max. It's been three weeks now, and I still have a way to go. I keep stalling because the plot keeps repeating: sexy spyman lusts after girl and is determined to have her, girl develops hots for sexy spyman and wonders if... Repeat cycle ad nauseum. Add lazy writing (he "went painfully hard" over and over again), nothing inspiring at all in the words, flat stereotype characters, and, well, boring.
1 ||| Like a few others here have reported, the OXO broke right below the hinge. I would call it an average press with a better hand grip. The plastic hole clearer tended to stay lined up and worked ok. It broke while being used in normal service.
4 ||| My older son picked up a copy of this graphic novel at a library book sale. It's been languishing around the house for a few years. A week ago, it turned up on the kitchen table. On a lark, I picked it up and started reading it. I was immediately sucked in.While I'm not much on graphic novels, this one is well done. It's well drawn, the dialogue (and monologue) is first-rate, and the wit is, well, dripping.I'm happy I read it -- I had a blast. Now I need another cup of coffee, I think. While I find the pot, you go find this book and read it.
3 ||| For a young adult title, this book was quite intriguing. It is a dystopian novel in which a child is chosen to be the person that will carry on all the knowledge that society keeps from the general public. He starts questioning society and has to decide what he should do. Very quick read.
3 ||| This is the funniest thing which I've read in a long time!!Everyone has thoughts about how to best tackle relationships, but I'd have to say that this is the most unique approach which I have ever read!!
2 ||| It was definitely not like the new one. It had very little special effects but was a lot more realistic. Made me jump once, so I'm impressed. It is old and shows it in the somewhat plotkilling soundtrack. Acting is good, and the plot is easy to follow along to. Same basic story as the new one, except toned down a whole lot, but is not missing anything. Watch if you're more into a mystery/thriller.
3 ||| Book arrived in great shape and was exactly what I expected it to be. Great service and prompt shipping. Nothing was a surprise and no compaints.
4 ||| This is a marvelous opus into which you can really sink your teeth! Of course, I had seen the famous James Dean film version, but had no previous idea of what an expansive, sweeping epic it had been based on--- the book far surpasses the wonderful film. The incredible gift Steinbeck has for storytelling, the classic yet complex characters and the dramatic, original storylines will sweep you up page after page after page.It's especially satisfying to find a juicy read that lasts so long (this edition @ 600 pages) to bring you a fulfilling reading experience you can savor. The author's many pearls of wisdom and insightful spin on the Cain & Abel story will stay with you long after you finish. It's also a fascinating look at the foibles and fortunes of early 20th Century Americans. It's a book to enjoy and to share.I can't believe it took me so long to discover this literary treasure, which quickly leapt to the Top 10 List of my all-time favorites.
3 ||| I think that this book was one of Steinbeck's better books. But I think that Lennie's character is too childish and stupid. Also, I think that George is pretty cool, but sometimes too over demanding and bossy, to Lennie. For the most part though, I thought it was a good book. I would recommend it to someone who has a special younger or older friend in their life. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 8.5. This book is not recommended for those that are overly sensitive people (see ending). Hope you enjoy the book; try chekcing out some of Steinbeck's other works. Enjoy, and happy reading!
2 ||| Loving the movie, the book gives you a little bit more info but is not as romantic.But if you are a fan I recomended.Awesome story
1 ||| I've been a huge Shawnna fan since I heard her on all of DTP's songs. She's kills it on songs like R.P.M. and N.S.E.W. (and some others) where she just goes nuts. She didnt have very good beats to work with and I expected more fast songs besides Block Reincarnated and R.P.M., and Posted which had all alredy been released.I feel guilty doing this but dont buy this CD. Just "acquire" these songs:-Weight A Minute- The Violin makes for a HOTTTTTT Beat. All my friends who didnt even know who Shawnna was like this song.)-Let's Go- Pretty fast song-R.P.M.- Not a new song but its one of my favorites ever.Other hot songs with Shawnna:-Posted (Golden Grain)-Break Somethin (Golden Grain)-N.S.E.W (Golden Grain)-Pimp Council (Golden Grain)-Slum (2 Fast 2 Furious Soundtrack)-Get The **** Back (Word of Mouf)
2 ||| While many extol the supposed virtues of this novella as either a great gothic story, or insightful social commentary, I found neither. Rather, it is a tale of Dr Jekyll, a man who invents a potion that allows him to transform himself into a more assertive, albeit fiendish being (Mr. Hyde) for a small period of time where his original personality is suppressed. These periods grow longer as Jekyll loses control etc. etc. It's not a bad concept but I found it not to be much more deep than that - it seemed kind of on the same level as spin-off versions of the concept, like the film "The Mask".This had the potential to be a much more punchy, psychological story but psychology is not Stevenon's special trademark. The result is simply a good (not great) and not particularly memorable novella - at least it wasn't memorable for me.
4 ||| I can't believe it's been 13 years since I first heard this CD. Funny thing is I listened for 3 or 4 years before I actually listened to the lyrics too.Another KOD reviewer on Amazon had problem with some of the gay-themed lyrics. If you can't get over that, then frankly you don't deserve to hear it. The guitar effects will put you in a trance, and the songs flow together seamlessly. One of the reasons KOD didn't have mainstream success is their songs are some heavy duty songs about LOVE, both gutwrentching, and glorious.One of the top 10 CD's that changed my life.Just buy it.
4 ||| This is one of the great musicals of all time. The Blu-ray technology captures the beautiful mood colorings of certain of the backgrounds. I would recommend this to anyone who loves films from the greatest musical team of the 20th century.
4 ||| What are the essential relationships among work, money, property, services? Find out with certainty with this book that will give you a great grounding in the arena of economics and allow you to know why capitalism works and communism doesn't.
3 ||| I saw this one Friday night and soon after bought the dvd. The other reviews give you a plot breakdown, but I will mention a few things I really like. Filmed in Germany(West Berlin) maybe, and lots of outdoor city locations. I have only viewed the sub-titled version, and it works great. A couple dialogue- heavy scenes which require some reading, but not too taxing. I do have a thing for most things German, so I like hearing the language. Also a fine soundtrack in this film! Techno and pulsing, watch this on a home theatre or with a high quality audio system. It really adds to the experience imho. Plus I enjoyed the little "snapshot" stills that Twyker throws in along the way. Very cool.Some negative reviewers say they didn't get the film and it was repetitive. Just go along for the ride and enjoy the sights and sound. In my opinion this is a real good way to spend an hour and a half. Try it out! Thanks for reading my sort of disjointed review.
3 ||| For some reason alot of people hate this movie. I knowthat the first version didn't make much sense, but the thespecial edition does.Still a good movie though.
3 ||| This is an excellent book for the history of style, proportions, and ergonomics. It is especially useful for the cabinetmaker who is custom designing furniture. The golden section (golden rectangle) is covered in the most precise detail I have ever seen. The tables and charts are extremely helpful in the design stage of any project. If you design furniture, you'll definitely want this book in your library.
3 ||| This is an excellent current selection for beginning Adorno students. The contents are much more generally useful than the title implies; this is not just a Holocaust-theory reader but a general Adorno selection of some worth. Since there's no other existing Adorno reader (that I know of) with such a broad, accessible, and interesting selection, this might be the one to pick for students not yet acquainted with his work. To me it looks like, for certain fields at least, this could end up being a counterpart to the well-respected "Marx-Engels Reader" as a broad introductory selection.
0 ||| I think this product should be recalled, specifically because it's packaging looks too much like Skinny & Sweet. I mean there's a big radilogical symbol on the side, but I thought that jut meant it tasted really good. I put some in my bosses coffee, and well... he's dead now. luckily I only confided this fact with my friends in the women's room.After checking the stalls first.I mean, I'm not an idiot. I don';t want word of this getting around or anything,Anyway, recall the stuff, make new packaging and I won't have to go stealing bodies from the morgue.Not that... I... stole a body or anything like that.
1 ||| Shoes were great but needed different size. Return was lost for sometime but finally found. Big hassle!
2 ||| This is a decent tool for lower-intermediate Arabic students. It's basically just a series of vocab lists, sorted by theme. You can scroll through the lists in English, Arabic, or transliteration, and there are good audio recordings of the pronunciation of every piece of vocab. Also, there are notes on some of the words that provide a deeper understanding of their meaning and usage, e.g. proverbs or common phrases that contain the words.The frustrating thing is that there's not really a way to tag the words you know and pare the lists down to the ones you don't know, and there are no drills or quizzes built into the software. You also can't build your own lists, of either additional vocab or of selected tough words from the existing lists. So an application like RapidRote with built-in quiz functionality and with the ability to create your own lists is a little bit better.I would love to see these folks add some more features and flexibility to the next version.
1 ||| Works fine for kids who are more reserved. It was fun for them to hide in and play. But it does not withstand being moved often and kids who ruff house. The poles will push through the corner holders by being moves frequently. I reinforced them to prolong use. But when my daughter fell on the tent one of the poles snapped and it was game over. It lasted 2 months.
0 ||| Having just finished this book I'm kind of sorry I did. Not completely sorry, as I liked the interactions between people and think Updike has a great eye for what makes people tick. But, about 100 pages into the book I was tired of reading all the net and snare metaphors ridden to exhaustion and decided to skip most of the overwrought description and focus on the interactions between people. The one thing that kept me going was a mild interest in seeing how Rabbit would devolve or evolve, but honestly, unlike most of the other characters, he's the same jackass at the end of the book that he is at the beginning. In the real world people who refuse to learn from experience are oddly fascinating, at first, but in books they stale quickly. Maybe the Rabbit series gets better, I hope so, but, I don't think I'll ever find out.
2 ||| "The Giver" deals with a very strange world where people have to follow a lot of rules to build a painless society! I can't decide if this novel is mainly written for children or adults. I suppose, it's very interesting to compare our today's world with the Givers's society but the story is a little bit boring. I think, the philosophical aspects (e.g. talking about love) are mainly adults' topics while the story is written in such a simple style that even young children may understand and that doesn't really satisfy me. Coming to conclusion, "The Giver" has a lot of interesting aspects of social and philosophical topics but the story is too simple to be exciting.
2 ||| May be its a Cologne, that's why its not long lasting but I expected it to be long lasting expecting its more than average price compare to other cologne.I just love smell but I wish if it stays more than 2 hours on my cloths
3 ||| This book was great, the author obviously had amazing courage and a real zest for life along with an exceptionally positive attitude.If you want to know something about the life and times of pioneers to the west than this is a real window. I had to keep checking it wasn't a novel at first, quite an adventure. Enjoy.
2 ||| My husband loves these old movies. Especially when they have cool cars in them. He has seen this many times and never gets tired of it.
3 ||| Most people have heard of mahalia jackson but do not listen to her try this cd you will like it.
4 ||| My husband loved this movie and especially the extra sceens. He's a big high school basketball fan, and this was a great story.
4 ||| The popularity of the romances of Georgette Heyer, who defined the "regency romance" genre, continues after her demise. "An Infamous Army," details the events prior to and following the Battle of Waterloo with a realism that is acute. Ms. Heyer uses characters from previous books, "The Devil's Cub," "Regency Buck," and refers to characters from "These Old Shades" to build this enthralling romance that has no happy ending.Reading the four (her only series) is a visit with old friends, when you need a fix for good writing, strong characters, good dialogue, and a firm sense of a historical period.Nash Black, author of "Taxes, Stumbling Blocks and Pitfalls for Authors 2007" and "Qualifying Laps."
3 ||| Overall very good. Sounds like old Who (Tommy era). The whole CD came out on 10/31/06. Very Good CD. If you are a true Who fan you will like it.
4 ||| I love it. Play it in my car. It's the only one I play besides Joe Moss & Nick Moss's c d's.
0 ||| Having been forced to read "Looking Backward" by Edward Bellamy, for a American History class, I can safely say that there are some parts that are interesting, but most of the novel is about as mind numbing as watching paint dry!
0 ||| I bought this for my daughter-in-law to help her find God's purpose in her life as she goes through this difficult time. What this book does is teach New Age theology and is not Biblical, and the author names her "god" Universe. I returned the book.
3 ||| A wonderful conclusion to one of sci-fi's cosmic chapters. Less sweeping than "2001," but classic Clarke
2 ||| I had to read this book for my English class. The book would be much better if we lived in the time that it was supposed to satirize, the 1950's. Arthur Miller depicts the McCarthy era by using the Salem witch trails which is a very effective way of showing the the insaness of McCarthy's ways. The Salem "Witches" portray McCarthy's "communists." It is a good book, but at times it is a little slow and you must trudge on through the book. Overall pretty decent book.
4 ||| it was what i needed because i am learning how. the book has many easy steps to help me. i am glad i choose this book.
0 ||| I enjoy the movie or else I wouldn't have ordered it. However the quality of the film was very poor. It was grainy and the sound was not good quality. I was disappointed.
2 ||| I must confess that I have enjoyed the four previous releases from the Black Crowes. I know, I know, the last two were not supposed to have been up to par - but, honestly, I liked them all. When I heard that By Your Side was coming - well, I couldn't wait. Honestly, I am a bit let down in that I really enjoyed the direction the band was taking. This CD is fine; not really a bad song on it; but, something is missing that I always found on the other four. Can't quite put my finger on it. I know this one is being compared to the early Stones, the Faces, etc. I hear it, but I really think they left something of themselves out this time. At any rate, I've listened through it several times and will continue to play it. If you like the Black Crowes, if you like good southern rock - give it a try. I doubt you will regret buying it. If you are like me, though, I think you will eventually find yourself playing their earlier stuff more.
1 ||| The launch tower does not stay connected to the launch pad but for a minute or two. I am glad that I bought this at discount and feel bad for the folks who paid full price. My little guy has been begging for this toy for months and he is frustrated with it. I will most likely return this and purchase the t-tower which is a bit less expensive.
4 ||| How one magazine review stated that this was the worst album of 2000 astounds me. It is not their best effort, but compared to 99% of the bands out there it is amazing. Great hooks, great song structures, and great singing. Please listen to this album for what it is, and I promise you will love it.
1 ||| ... but there's WAY, WAY too much political preaching. First I must state that after spending almost 13 years in the military, there's nothing more that I like than a good military techno-thriller. Patrick Robinson's novels were high on my list of such authors --- until this one.Arnold Morgan was a strong believable character in Robinson's first two novels, but becomes crazed, growling and too unbelievable in this one. If Robinson would just leave his political rants out of his books, I would've rated this one much higher -- but I just got turned off by the many unavoidable preaching and degrating comments and references about our past (and present) U.S. leaders and policy makers.
0 ||| Amazon offered 1984 for its Kindle E-book reader, but then the electronic version's publisher decided it didn't want to make the book available that way. So Amazon deleted the book from the Kindles of customers who had already purchased it and credited their accounts. A small problem: what about annotations people had made on the book for their term papers? A big problem: what if I buy a book by a liberal and Amazon decides they only like books by conservatives, so they delete the book from my player? This is a despicable action, and I will be boycotting Amazon until they publicly change their policy. There are plenty of places to buy books online.
4 ||| these are much better then huggies , first off huggies run smaller, they dont hold as much for as long eaither, the design seems nice but the over all quality is good just isnt as good in my option for the price dif. ,
4 ||| I bought this talking compass for my grandfather who is blind. He has enjoyed taking it on his walk to the mailbox in order to make sure he does not get turned around.
1 ||| A little scary. I'm sure it's a fluke,but the one I bought the inside of one tent had an inseam not sewn around the metal frame of tent, therefore a portion of metal frame was available to toddler. Possibility of breaking and small metal pieces was all I could invision.Therefore I sent product back. The other 2 tents were in perfect condition, as was the 3 tunnels, so as I said,I'm sure it's a fluke, but didn't want to take a chance for my 2yr old.
2 ||| I was ridiculously eager for this book to be published. And then, somewhat disappointed. To my mind, this is the weakest of the series so far.This being said, it is still a ripping good tale. Jordan should be commended for being able to (more or less) successfully sustain such a mammoth story over so many volumes and such a period of time.Although not the strongest effort, again (as with all previous volumes), the plot takes some interesting twists and turns, introducing new characters and new tensions.My fear, though, is that Jordan really does not know how, when, or where the series is going to end. There are an increasingly large number of loose ends which will need to be tied together or the ending of the series will be a disappointment of major proportions.
0 ||| Should not be used with Thunderbolt! Probably any capacitative touch screen. Destroys calibration for touch. Had to do factory reset! A call to HTC confirmed that. Wish phone had come.win a warning.
1 ||| This book started out as very interesting, but I became bored with it in the last half. I wouldn't recommend it to others.
1 ||| This video has good production value, yet is restricted only to basic Pilates movements; it does not demonstrate how you can progress in the Pilates method. Another limitation of this video is that it does NOT include the importance of flowing movement, rhythm, dynamics, and energetic tempos, all of which Joseph Pilates believed are essential to his method of body conditioning. I would recommend Classical Pilates technique videos because they demonstrate Joseph Pilates original method. It is very important to see the ENTIRE RANGE of exercises to develop and appreciation for Joseph Pilates' brilliant method, and to inspire you to higher levels of accomplishment and energizing fun!
0 ||| Stain marks on new cutains, water stains! Plus a large white spot with no color. I washed them according to directions, and the stains still remained as did the large white spot. To me they look like a "return" and they "resold them as is" to me. It's sad. Won't purchase again.
0 ||| I'v read some boring books before but this one takes the cake. I couldn'g even finish it. It jumped around from one time period and civilization to another. I love history, but I couldn't even remember any significant event that stood out in the book.
2 ||| I loved loved loved the reviews, and had high hopes. The nozzle is nicely made, solid, and looks like it is of very high quality. If you fiddle with the shaping screw you can perhaps achieve a good spray. I haven't found it yet :)
2 ||| I'm a Stephen King fan so this is not easy for me to say but... Carrie is not one of his better books. It was the first book he published and you can tell. King himself admits in his book "On Writing" that Carrie is not one of his best books.
1 ||| Between the constant whining and ramblings of the main characters to the cheap filler in the pages....this book has trully brought what was a great series...to its knees. I hope Mr. Jordan can turn it around and do the last books like the first books....or this series will end with a "whimper" and not with a "Bang" as it should. Get the story moving again Robert! And lets get on with the show!!! I only hope great authors like George R. R. Martin and others' works don't begin to take a TOO much of a toll on the fall from grace Jordan is taking.
0 ||| The cover has Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day on it. Naturally one would expect them to be in in. WRONG! DECEIVED!!! Do NOT buy this version!!!!
3 ||| Some of the other reviewers of this product were less than happy with the quality of the product, or the sound of phonograph records or other media formats. Well, yeah, it doesn't sound all that great compared with other systems...but the buyer should already have something better for listening. As a recording device, it was pretty good, and that's why I bought the Crosley...to transfer old cassettes and records to the CD format for preservation purposes. It worked fine. I thought the design of the front panel was a overly complex and hard to read, but I got used to it. Crosley might have added a VU meter and adjustment to the recorder, but that would have jacked up the cost. All in all, and for the recording purpose, it's a pretty good tool. The object CD-Rs sound just like the original cassettes and records.
2 ||| I enjoy the Anita Blake series because they are entertaining and a fast read. :) Plus, hello, vampires? YES! :)
3 ||| Smaller than I expected. But cute. Had a heck of a time snapping the mounting strap around the extinguisher. The strap was too small. Extinguisher too fat. I hope it works if I ever needed it..lol
3 ||| a charming book to wander about in. but for one item, a 14th century ballad of the meanings of the stones ,each months birth stone and the reason for it. Worth the price for any one who loves the history of gemstones for these two pages alone.
1 ||| You might think that this is a bad rating but come on! Don't you think a 5-year-old getting super brain powers is a little cliché? Anyway, I would recommend this book for anyone who likes Roald Dahl books. It's a story of a girl named Matilda who has parents that treat her like dirt and a headmistress who, well lets just say if life were like Star Wars than she would be Darth Vader. From hats glued to somebody's haed too a parrot up a chimny this is a must read book for any Roald Dahl fan!
1 ||| If I remember correctly, Starkey's book started off as a doctoral thesis. It reads like one, despite her attempt to inject drama into a period of history that needs no such injection. Her modern enquiry is rather dated now, as she used the technique of Freudian analysis to explain away the hysteria surrounding the trials and to explain how something like this could have happened. The psychoanalysis may hit on a grain of truth, but a lot of what she stated was merely conjecture. I would have been more interested to know about the link between the real dangers the Puritans faced (dangers over which they had very little control in their new, hostile, strange environment) and their belief system, which left them ripe to believe in imagined ones.
3 ||| Maeve Binchy never disappointed. I enjoyed the story of the characters who sought to achieve the dream of an education, the teacher who inspired and, of course, the clash of classes in the time it was written. (It probably still exists!) Ms. Binchy can make you laugh, cry, and care. You want them all to succeed. Not all do,but the reader will enjoy discovering which ones rise above class prejudice and the resentment and disappointment of those who do not.
2 ||| The PDR-M60 is a more economical choice. 2 megapixels is all you need for 8X10 prints.The M70 is just the M60 with: a) 3.3 megapixels instead of 2.3 b) a movie movie (how useful is a 2 minute movie? it just takes up valuable space), c) an extra 32MB of memory (24 onboard and a 16MB card instead of 4mb card included),Other than that the optics, flash, and various shooting features are identical....the movie mode is cute but not something I'll use more than once or twice.All that being said, if you absolutely have to have 3+ megapixels, the PDRM70 is a good choice.Either way, using rechargable AA batteries is the way to go. Being able to buy a couple of Alkaline batteries in a pinch beats missing out on pictures. My Sony's propriatery rechargable batteries were...unreliable.
2 ||| This book kept me reading, but had its boring spots. Good book but don't read the next powerplays.
1 ||| This book is very, very superficial. Only a small part of the configuration of Tomcat is covered. Plus, it is certainly outdated today.
4 ||| Marilyn Manson is the rockstar we all wish we could be. He does and says whatever he wants...whenever he wants. This album is loaded with fantastic and confrontational lyrics and hard hitting industrial beats all put nicely to a pseudo "rap" cyberpunk approach. A fun and outrageous endeavor....awesome album indeed MR. Manson.
2 ||| I got this game a couple of days ago. Basically each civilization gets about 20 similar units. You have to chop trees to harvest carbon and mining for ores and crystals. Those are your basic requirements. I finished the training missions and didn't get very far (only on level 3 of the Trade Federation). I am playing on the hard level of difficulty. I can say it takes forever to finish. The units move kind of slowly and clumsily and the game drags on forever. Very often the CPI units are behind laser turrets which are in turn under the cover of a shield generator. Penetrating that was difficult. The ranged units are pretty much useless against structures. Have to rely upon melee attack. I don't know whether I will ever finish this game. Got to get a life as well.......
1 ||| albeit with an attitude. She's stuck in a way too predictible formula comedy. All that is left is the particulars. A novelist, Alex is under fire, literally to produce a novel quickly to get the money to pay off loan sharks who want to kill him. He hires steno, Emma & she moves almost literally into his life as he begins to crank out a novel; with her critical comments along the way. It is soon obvious that the novel is paralleling their going relationship. Yes, of course, they are falling in love.The movie flashes between the present day & the 1920's Gatsby-like setting of the novel. The problem is they are all too aware that this is happening. That they know that this is causes the movie to lose much of the charm it could have had if the two stories proceeded with Emma & Alex blithely ignorant of what was happening. Art imitates life. Or is it life imitates art? I could squeeze 21/2 stars.
2 ||| You will get three different sizes, which is a waste when only one size fits you. Otherwise it is a durable product. I've had others that disintegrate after a few weeks use, but this product lasts.
3 ||| Hi everybody!I like this dvd in first place because you can find most of theKeystone stuff wich are hard to find.I know the quality is not good but if you're interested in Chaplin earliest films i doubtyou can find it with a better quality nowadays.I also like this dvd because you can choose if you want to hear the original soundtrack or the sound of the old reelers.The presentation is cool too.Recomended for those who want to find the Chaplin Keystone reels.
1 ||| I realy loved every "Jack Ryan" book that Clancy wrote until this one. This one is one too much. "Jack Ryan" was consumed to its poor end. Enough. He should start thinking of a new hero, no Jack Ryan, no John Clark, but a new one, a fresh one.The book was boring from page 1 until about 200 pages from the end. These last 200pages were more interesting, but still, as a unit, this book is boring.As a Clancy fan, I hope that he will return to himself next time.
2 ||| I was hoping that the title meant: "Advanced grammar and its more arcane forms"What it truly meant was: "Normal grammar text with a supercilious and pompous title"My father was always strict about grammar as I grew up, and rather growing a dislike for it, I fell in love with words and word play. I became the type of person who would argue the merits of the Oxford Comma and wonder about bound root morphemes with friends. I fantasize about owning my own copy of the OED. I wanted a book to review the more difficult and erudite aspects of English grammar. The title intrigued me, but failed to live up to my expectations. This is a fairly rudimentary treatment of grammar. I've seen better, and I've seen worse. Not a purchase I regret, but do not expect anything beyond the standard grammar text that attempts to be interesting.
4 ||| This album packs a punch, with mega hits like The Thunder Rolls and Friends in Low Places. Representitive of his older style, this is an album that is sure to please even the most timid country music fans. If you like Garth, you'll love this album! You can sing along with most of the songs and it has a little of everything in it.
2 ||| Pros: large size, heating element, air jetCons: water spill, airjet too strong, no temperature control.I received it as a gift. It has a nice large size and should be large enough for average or slight large feet. It is good to get a heated foot spa. But whenever you turn it on, the airjet started running, either low of high speed. But even the low is still strong and often time water would run all the way over the splashguard and spill outside the spa. So you'll have to use your feet to block the airjet. The heater works, but you'll have to turn it on and off and there is no constant temperature control.What I really want to see if a foot bath that has a constant temperature control and have more gentle setting on the air jet. Or make the front end of the splashguard larger to block the jetted water.I'll give it an average rating.
1 ||| I have watched the first series that came out on television. The first Christy was amazing to watch and share in the lives with the characters on screen or in the book. But after they found a new Christy to play the part in the continuing stories on dvd it all went down hill. It does not have a clear picture and the people that play in it are not relaxed or do well in their parts.
4 ||| Highly recommend this DVD version of Forbidden Planet. The quality of the transfer is clean and crisp. The extras on the second DVD is worth watching. If you are a fan of 1950's science fiction movies, this is a must have for your collection.
4 ||| We saw the advertisement of this group on a few Barney tapes. Every time we saw it my son would get up and dance. I loved the idea of a video that would keep him busy for a while but that he didn't just sit on the couch and watch. Every time he watches it he gets a work out. I love this video and it makes me feel good to let him watch it(even sometimes twice in a row). My daughter who is 15 months is also dancing (or wiggling) to the video.
3 ||| Currently I am enroled in a Children's Literature class reviewing poetry. I selected this poetry collection because I am focusing on Elementary School children and the development of poems in their curriculum. This collection is creative and magnified in language and the illustrations are delightful, delicate paintings done by Pamela Paparone. Each illustration addds wry humor and gives the reader a better understanding of the Two-legged, Four-legged, No-legged Friends that we have.
2 ||| In my eyes, Manson will never make a bad album... so I can only compare this with his other better works. I like it, and I would bye it. But there's just a few things about it that don't step up to his previous albums. First off, Mobscene's cheerleading chants are a total rip off of Faith No More's "Be Aggressive". Also I just don't feel the passion like his previous albums... I guess it happens to the best. They start off pissed off at the world, then they get rich and famous, and aren't so pissed off anymore... still if your a Manson fan, you should know that you can enjoy any of his works, he'll never make a "bad" album.
2 ||| I thought this was so-so, but I was really disappointed by Bill. He is usually my fave of all of them, but he just seemed so uppity. Seriously making fun of minimum wage workers? Not funny. Jeff was great as usual and it is hard for me to watch Larry without thinking he really doesn't talk like that so I am always trying to catch him slipping. It was ok, but not as good as the last one.
1 ||| Let's face it: this is a children's novel. It's designed for children to read and think they're reading an adult novel without realizing that that's what they're supposed to think.The problem is, the language and the way they talk may make it hard for children to get through. Basically, Treasure Island has lost its target audience.However, it is still a cute adventure romp that has inspired many of its kind (with or without Johnny Depp). Read it as a classic, not anything else.
4 ||| This movie really captures a world, or perhaps I should say a universe, and makes it come to life unlike any movie I've seen since the Matrix. It is complete with never before seen characters, planets, and civilizations. Ultimately, it is a tale of dark conformity and religious tyranny and the one man, Riddick, who resists it. The film actually probes deeper issues--and rather symbolically at that--and this makes it more powerful. The best aspect of the film is that its tension keeps building up to the final crescendo. The ending is most unexpected and awe-inspiring.
2 ||| Enemy at the Gates opens with an impressive battle sequence that unleashes the horrors of war and displays just how furious and devastating the battle of Stalingrad was. After that harrowing set piece, the movie settles down to a cat-and-mouse game between two legendary snipers (Jude Law vs. Ed Harris). Such moments are tense, but too much of the film is ineffective, such as the romance between Law and Rachel Weisz, the incredibly derivative musical score (the usually great James Horner, ripping off his own work such as The Perfect Storm and Braveheart, as well as from Schindler's List), the predictable plot, and rushed pacing and editing. Still recommended for war film fans.
3 ||| We had to buy "The Last Unicorn" DVD because our VHS tape was worn out through years of use. This movie is one that my wife has always liked and wanted our children to enjoy as well. We watch it together at least twice a year now that the kids are older, but it is still one that either kid might watch on their own more often.The story is great, the animation is OK, and the DVD transfer is barely acceptable. That being said, this is a very worthwhile movie.Recommended!
4 ||| This would have to rank as one of my all-time favorite books, and certainly one of Atwood's best. This story of a society dominated and controlled by an unfettered right-wing Christian government is absolutely terrifying. The movie does not do justice to the book, but it was a nice effort.
1 ||| these are hard to handle and keep coming off the can. I wouldn't buy them again
1 ||| I have a hard time understanding why there are so many positive reviews here. This book is nothing but fluff. If you are anything more than a newbie, it's got nothing and if you're a complete newbie there's just enough information to be dangerous. She promises periodically that more information will be given about actually growing certain plants, but that information is never forthcoming.It's full of personal anectdotes that have little to do with the topic at hand, the tone is condescending and she encourages the use of poisons. She anthropomorphizes plants in an embarrassing way, telling a story about a poisonous plant she accidentally purchased as if it had a personal vendetta against her and her family. Her attitude toward plants goes beyond respect into something slightly off-kilter.The book is good for a giggle. If you must read it, make sure you have a firm grasp of both gardening and herbal magic first. Otherwise you could well follow this lady into lala land.
3 ||| This is a good movie. Tons of action. Classic in every way. Of course the story is cheese and this should only be picked up if you enjoy brain dead action flicks.
3 ||| I bought this to answer questions and settle arguments about Greek and Roman mythology in various word-based game forums. It is a classic and a standard reference. It does little with any mythology of non-mediterranean people.
2 ||| This is by far my favorite Chuck Norris movie--- he's a Hitman and one mean dude.Too bad it's full-frame only, it was originally a widescreen release and as I remember, it uses the full frame.And dvdtown.com calls the video "fuzzy".How could Warner do this ? Somebody over there knows better because they put out a lot of great stuff, like the Noir collections.Why put out a sub-standard dvd ?
4 ||| This film may have had a more widely accepted following, had it not been a "Halloween" film--but still a wonderful horror film! This film centers on the evil plot of Conal Cochran to distribute his "custom" Halloween masks to millions of children. Dr. Challis, along with the help of Ellie Grimbrage, seek to uncover Cochran's evil plan and stop "the big giveaway at nine." Worthy of a sequel, Halloween III delivers all the gore and suspense that one could expect from a Carpenter/Hill horror production. Although Myers doesn't make an appearence, Halloween III still stands as ONE of the best horrors of the eighties! Watch this film as an independant film and not a Halloween sequel and perhaps the rivalry amongst Halloween fans towards this film may end.Halloween III delivers!!!
4 ||| i ordered this and i keep hearing review that the quality is so bad and then sound is too well i just got it and it isnt realy that bad its great for only 8$ because you get the movie (i have to admit the quality is like a vhs but who cares)the original one not some 30th anniversary that ruined its good name and though the features arent hat good there pretty fun to play around with (the trivia game)so ifyou really extremely love this movie i get this dvd but if your upsest with it get the millenium edition for 20$ but this version is good for people who like it but not really too crazy about it
4 ||| Just recieved my grocery bags and I am very very pleased. They have lots of room and are really well made. I no longer have to use plastic that rips and you have to recycle,(for ever). I like the fact too that the bottoms are flat so nothing falls over. They are more then worth the price.
1 ||| This movie was a disappointment. If you aren't a science-fiction fan (and maybe if you are) you don't want to see I, ROBOT. It is one of those movies that is slow to get the least bit interesting and truly escalates at the conclusion of the movie. While Isaac Asimov was a great science-fiction writer, I, Robot in its movie version just doesn't cut it. Not even Will Smith can lighten this bland movie, with the exception of the ending. It just lacks in being a truly exciting movie. It seems like for a while it is a mix of drama and science fiction, and then here comes comedy relief from Will Smith. It is way overhyped and could've definitely been better. 2 stars.
2 ||| i have to say while the show is still funny its definetly not as good as it was originally. im tired of the constant stewie is gay jokes and want him back to trying to take over the world and so forth. the show is now more or less just running pop culture jokes. over all its worth buying for a quick laugh but not much else.
3 ||| Since I never traveled by train before I was looking for someone who could describe the ups and downs of train travel as well as the expense. This book does that perfectly as this man spent years doing just that on Amtrak. I am hoping some day to make a trip and want to know what to expect.
2 ||| I purchased this record via iTunes on May 5th of 2007. I went for one of my lengthy bike rides and brought the iPod along to listen to this record on the same day. I didn't find anything offensive about it upon the initial listen. I will give Messrs. Weinrib, Zivojinovich and Peart credit for being able to bring a certain degree of rock at their age. BUT...........................there is a triteness to the lyrics. Witness "No one gets to heaven without a fight"..."...spirit...strong...flesh is too weak"......yeah, Neil. yadda yadda yadda. We all know that crap.Basically my reaction to and evaluation of this record is "So wart?"
2 ||| As an aspiring travel writer myself who just returned from 14 months around the world, I skimmed this book to get a sense of Greenwald's style, where he's been, and how he views the world. I found the writing to be really good when he wasn't so busy sharing all the great things he's done and how much he likes himself. There's an air of self-aggrandizement that gets in the way of the stories. If he could just take a more humble approach, I'd be more intrigued and inspired. To be perfectly honest, a part of me is jealous of Greenwald for having visited many of these places in the '90s before they became so overtouristed. Overall I think he does a great job of offering pertinent historical facts and great backgrounds that make the experience so much more real and interesting. He just needs to get off his high horse.
0 ||| Quite simply, there is absolutely nothing of substance in this book. I wouldn't even recommend it to a novice. A complete waste of my time and money!
0 ||| This book is horrible, when I read it I cried at the obserdity of it. It starts out with the main charactor driving in a car, she stops at a bus stop and suddenly recieves a small native american child for no reason. The child's name is Turtle, she's at least three but because of sexual abuse looks like an infant. Again ridiculous. Unfortunately this book doesn't stop there, for about ten chapters she just complains and complains about how hard it is to find a man and raise a kid, tear. In the end the novel simplely implodes with no real conclusion. [...]
2 ||| This is a great book it just isn't for the faint at heart. I would recommend this book if you have a real rating of 1500 or higher or an online rating of 1800. I am rated 1700 on chessmaster and have drawn simulated grandmasters my online rating is 1500 but this book was definately beyond my scope.
3 ||| This is officially compatible with DYMO's:- LabelManager 350, 450, PCII- LabelPoint 350- LabelWriter DUOBut it works just fine with the DYMO LabelManager 360D which is not on the list.On this cassette, the tape needed a little bit of 'priming' - had to manually pull about one inch out before anything could come out but all was flawless after that. The output is the expected ultra-crisp black on white and, according to the maker, the nylon base should make the labels stick perfectly to curved surfaces. In 'real life' the labels stickiness do meet my standards but I'll have to live with at least some air bubbles when applying them on curved objects.Overall... nice labels.Made in Belgium.
0 ||| i will admit the zombies were pretty good but the storyline was just horrible i was about to leave the cinema before it ended take my word for it waste of valuable Time!!!!! the only scary and horrible thing about this movie was...... the movie itself
4 ||| It works great and the price was cheaper here at Amazon than what TIVO sells it for on their website.
0 ||| I bought this product in January of 2007...... When I first got it I started having issues with it. I sent it in to get repaired it took about 2 months before I got one back..... The way that they work is when you send your brand new one in they send you an old repaired one back...... When I got the 1st used repaired one, I was having issues with that one as well.... I send that one back in and just recived the 3rd one... well guess what! This one doesn't work either..... I asked for a refund and they told me that it was past the refund time limit.Everytime I talked with customer service via on line chat they just say send it back, but I was told that I have up until January of 08 that they will fix them for free...... Even though I have not gotten a working one! This MP3 player is defective after my experience of getting 3.... I DON'T recommend this one.....
1 ||| I was super sad when this book arrived :( The print was sooooo small that no one wanted to read it. When purchasing the book on Amazon there was no "preview" of the pages or inside of the book. I guess that I learned my lesson. I ended up purchasing a different Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass book so that we could read a book that had larger print. I was not happy with this book, and would not recommend it to anyone if you enjoy "normal" size print. This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory.
2 ||| This book contained lots of helpful hints for the new sailor in a humorous way. Easy and fun to read!
2 ||| This device works well, but the filters need to be replaced often because they have shallow pleats and no prefilter. If you can find an air purifier with a washable filter, buy it. The replacements filters for this one can run up to $20 apiece. They probably cost the company $0.25 each to manufacture and ship. And good luck getting a replacement filter from the hardware store- I've looked, and while they have about 100 types of 3M filters, none of the local or chain stores I visited had them.I bought this device new from Woot.com two years ago for $20, and at the time there was a $20 rebate. I can't believe the same machine costs more than $100 here. It's a fan enclosed by plastic.3M - why are you so greedy?
1 ||| This re-make fails to evoke true terror, trading for easier shocks thanks to easily distinguished CGI effects. Might have worked as an original idea, but being a re-make of a classic movie, itself based on a classic novel, necessitates living up to the original, which this movie did not.
4 ||| Fluid, snap happy, toe-tapping delightful. Fresh and fun. Great house-cleaning music.
4 ||| I purchased my machine from Costco more than a year ago and has been using it every morning. I find many of the one star comments curious and unsettling. My experience with this machine has been 5 stars. No complaint whatsoever. So, either I got real lucky and purchased a super machine, or these people are idiots who do not know how to operate this simple machine. I am planning to buy another one for my vacation home because I am happy with the one I have.Later, I bought another one because I was so happy with the first one. Then I reazlie alot of the problem and complants may have been caused by hard water in many parts of the country. I think if everyone follow the instructions and use only purified or filtered water, then the machine should work without a glitch.
3 ||| The product photo shows one black and one red dampener, but TennisExpress shipped to me two white dampeners. I was actually hoping for the red and black ones, just to match my racquet, but I do know that is only cosmetic. The dampeners function just fine.
0 ||| This is the worst cover of one of the best pop songs of 1990's, buy the original version by the La's.
4 ||| King's characters stick with you. His attention to detail and the real life human traits he gives his 'fictional' characters make it hard to believe they're not walking off the page. It's more than the horror and suspense, there's a special quality that he gives to a novel that forces it to linger.I'll admit that I never start a Stephen King novel unless I have hours of free time to read it, or can pull a late nighter, because I'm not going to put it down for long. Whenever he features a book dealing with aliens and the state of Maine, I have to chuckle. How many of you readers, besides myself, have friends living in Maine who swear Alien visitations are real?Chrissy K. McVayAuthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'
3 ||| Hello, I received this product in good conditions! It is certainly an original article and category. I highly recommend the essence and aroma of the perfume does not equal another.
1 ||| It broke the first time it was played with, I returned it and got a bigger one because I was not satisfied with this one.
4 ||| In one word: Coolness. Anthony Burgess has won my devotion with this one. Almost the most disturbing thing I've ever read, this book is satisfying all the way. There is no bad part. It never gets boring. And it is so creative in it's language concepts that... well it's creative! Read this book, or you are doing an injustice to yourself. Oh, and watch the movie too.
4 ||| If you like Tarantino movies, I think you would enjoy this one. Of course, the obligatory violence....but also the great dialogue. There is a memorable scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken.....Awesome! Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are very credible, and perform their roles beautifully. Give it a go!
3 ||| I found this book to be very interesting, despite the fact that it seems to be mostly the sayings of his disciples. Some of the translations are pretty rough, making little sense. But hey, its free.
2 ||| If you don't mind [pause...] waiting for the data [pause...] to download [pause...] while playing [pause...], then this is the game for you [pause...]. The game also crashes often. If you decide to play, make sure you SAVE A LOT. Overall, I like the idea of having my favorite game on the PSP but I think that it needs improvement.
0 ||| If you want to hear the real Charlie Parker, don't buy this Cd because the strings are too overwhelming, believe me. I bought it and took it back the same day. And got another one of his cd's instead. Only 1 star for this CD but it's not because of Charlie. I don't even think that Charlie Parker would've sincerely enjoyed this.
4 ||| GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is excellent. Elton John hit it big with this one. It went number 1 in the US and in the UK. I bought this deluxe edition when I was 10 years old. My mom was a big Elton fan when this came out, so I thought I'll see how good it is. I thought this isn't good...... it's amazing. My fav songs are FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND/LOVE LIES BLEEDING, CANDLE IN THE WIND, BENNIE AND THE JETS, GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, GREY SEAL, JAMIACA JERK-OFF, SWEET PAINTED LADY, ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS LOVE ALICE, SATURDAY NIGHT'S ALL RIGHT FOR FIGHTING and HARMONY. Elton is my favorite solo artist. Bernie taupin is a great song writer.
0 ||| i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it.
3 ||| While the La Femme Nikita Soundtrack has used little known artists for all corners of the globe, it is what makesit a unique and quirky little recording. Upon listening to the CD I was surprised to discover that this is one CD that adds to the series and emulates the 'feel' of the first and second seasons.The mislabelling of the "Drown" track by Vibrolux, which is actually "Ground" just goes to prove the electic and eccentric quality of this CD. The bad reviews will not keep the fans of the series from buying because we know that the critics don't understand this one.
1 ||| I ordered several boxes of these and was very disappointed to find that these are not the improved "flex" kind. I only switched from cruisers to the baby dry because they were stretchy. Now I have several boxes of diapers that barely fit.
3 ||| Bought this as a reference book for a class I was taking, like most of my reference books, it didn't get to be used at all.
0 ||| I can't believe they're selling this movie. (A friend let me borrow his copy.) Bad acting (sorry Meg Ryan, but you did get better!), bad directing, bad special effects, no plot, no sympathetic characters. I laughed at the dorky demon when he jumped out of the well and lunged at the screen. But don't get me wrong, don't even waste your time watching this movie to laugh at how bad it really is, because it's not even campy. Really, it's so bad I wrote my first review just to warn you. They should throw all the copies of this movie in the well with that clown for a demon.
0 ||| This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under "Comedy" if not "Fiction". Putting it under an "Ecological Essay" is adding insult to injury. There is nothing "ecological" about this book, nor is this book an essay. This is the same man that thinks pissing in front of a predator will keep them at bay. I dare anyone to try that. Nevermind, don't, because I don't want to be tracked down for punitive damages after the person dies.
3 ||| This book, about small-town Georgia during and after the civil rights movement, describes a culture and a time with which I'm not familiar. It's well-written, and although it didn't end exactly the way I was hoping, it's honest, and I probably can't argue with the ending in a nonfiction book. This is a must-read for anyone interested in race relations in the US.
4 ||| Wonderful book! Exactly what I was looking for! Great company to do business with! Very pleased! Will do business with them again in the future!
4 ||| I started reading the Warriors series when I was about 11, and I was immediatly captivated. First off, I was searching desperatly for an animal-fantasy book, so this series was like a miracle. I started to read the book, and I couldn't stop. Each character is so interesting, and the chemistry between each was wonderful. I read the whole series as fast as I could. It's been two years, and I am still a faithful Warriors fan. The stories themselves have interesting plots that twist and turn in every direction. These are still some of my favorite books, even though I'm 13. These stories are a good pleaser for all ages.
3 ||| I love almost everything about this toddler puzzle. I don't like that it starts with 0 zero, since I've been teaching to count starting with 1.
0 ||| This novel is very slow moving, repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense. There was not enough material for a novel in this story. Poor Poirot! Poor reader. Skip this one.
2 ||| After seeing the movie I fell in love with the characters. I thought the book would bring more life to them and I would get to know them even better, because books do that, right? Well, I couldn't find it at the library for nearly 2 months, so I read two other of his books first. They really let me down. He writes a corny love story to toy with your emotions to sell books. I felt like I was reading a story a Freshman in High School would write. After reading the Notebook I was again saddened at his lack of writing abilities. He writes plain, no depth or soul or passion can I find in his characters. Yes, they have sex, so he writes about their passion for each other, which is easy to do, but he did not write the characters themselves to come alive. I think the third time's the charm for me... I will not read any more of his books. They are not getting any better for me, and I dearly love a good book!
4 ||| I had lots of fun watching the fights in this movie, the were wicked, I wish JCVD would make more movies like this and the Quest. If you like fighting or martial arts watch it
2 ||| Simple Plan brings absolutely nothing new, musically or lyrically, to the pop-punk scene as we know it, flat out. That said, this release still has its moments and the band is young and energetic. That in itself shows some promise. The songs deal with the average teenager's life: girls, high school, and problems with parents. Pretty cliche stuff. However, if you are still interested to see what these fellas can dish out, and you have some extra money laying around; go pick it up. There are some worthy tracks with pretty good repeat value on "No Pads, No Helmets...." They're worth a try.
3 ||| This movie was one of the first movies I watched on DVD and I did not read the novel "The Haunting of Hill House". That said, I found the movie interesting in the beginning, slow in the middle and action packed at the end.The setting was beautiful and the house had a great gothic look to it, but maybe the house overshadowed the characters some? The movie centered around one nervous character finding out who she really is and then defeating the bad guy at the end. The other actors were just innocent by-standers through most of the movie which hurt the film.I gave it four stars because of Zeta-Jones and the setting itself. This is not a terrible movie, but it could have been so much more.
4 ||| Great awareness raised on the real person, Gray Barker, who is responsible for the making of hollowood movies that we have enjoyed. I did not want to miss a second of this documentary. Applause for a well thought out and put together documentary. Great Job!!!!
2 ||| this book is about this futueistic world where everyone gets a chip in thier hand as a baby and when they are like 35 or something that chip gets deactivated and they die.this keeps the population under control.well ol logan didnt dig this idea and takes a hike and big brother goes out after him.thats about what i remember other than the book was fantastic and the movie wasnt all that great.
1 ||| Other than the setting, i.e., Lithuania, I found the book a great disappointment. More suited for children's literature.
4 ||| This product came exactly as represented by amazon and arrived much sooner than i could ever imagined. kudos to amazon.com for amazing service
2 ||| its a pretty good book but i expected a more intellegent book. id say it's more for the 12 year olds mind rather than a 16 year old. it doesn't have the info that i want.
2 ||| this is B-movie madness at its best.When Captain Thorne Sherman docks at an isolated island to drop off supplies, he becomes stranded by a hurricane. The island is also inhabited by a mad scientist Dr. Milo and his beautiful daughter Ann. Another scientist, Dr. Craigis, has been conducting tests to prevent overpopulation by shrinking humans. Accidentally in the process he creates a race of giant shrews that manage to escape during the storm.After the beasts devour all of the island's animal inhabitants, they turn their voracious appetites to human cuisine. No one is safe- not even the scientist that created them. And the only way to survive is to somehow make it off the island..B&W;, rated PG
2 ||| This book was a 4 star book just 4 months ago. Today, it is quickly slipping into the realm of dinosaurs as a function of its aging CDs, which feature Red Hat Linux v7.2. If you are interested in exploring Linux, this is one of the lesser-expensive ways to get started, and RHL 7.2 is at least a viable starting point for most newbies.I used the book a couple of times to try to figure out something specific to Linux, but the content is little more than a command summary similar to what the man pages offer and a basic installation and configuration guide.At the cover price as sold by Amazon, you can not beat this for a gift of Linux or other way of getting your hands on CDs...without downloading the files for "free."
2 ||| Item was in great shape. I didn't get it for almost a month after ordering but other then that everything was well done.
2 ||| There's one main reason to pick up this PSX gem. Spy Hunter. As a child of the 80's, I'm really getting a kick out of playing this one all over again. The switchblades have a way of ruining your day, but I'm anxious to get back to the boating adventures of everyone's favorite spy. Moon Patrol, Joust 2, and Tapper are also fun for nostalgia's sake. However, Its Spy Hunter that will keep me coming back to this new addition to my PSX library.
3 ||| This is one of the best exercise books I've read. It is easy to understand, gives really good information about diet and supplements. The section on how to do the exercises is a little superfluous if you've been in a gym, although even for seasoned fitness buffs there are some good tips. Hugo spells out a long term program week by week, and after 4 weeks I have seen gains. He definitely shows you how to mix up your routine and shock your body to adapt. Great book for those of us stuck doing the same 4 sets of bench every Monday.
1 ||| i was really looking forward to the new movie i was so mad when i found out that megan fox got booted i knew that it would be hard to replace her not cuz shes beautiful but storyline wiseman they really messed things up in this one its sooo diff story wise than other towfirst off i hate the girl in it yeah shes hot but she doesnt fit in megan was a poor hot girl didnt mind getting dirty or fighting this girl is spoiled rich girl afraid to break a nail type and theres no background really to there love so were suppose to believe hes so head over heals he wants to marry her?also her acting really sucked and so did sha laboufs i thought he was on speed the whole movie talked way to fast and way overly drmaticthe beginging to middle of the movie was lame they tried way to hard to make it funny when what made transformers so great the first two times was that it was almost like unentional jokeshowvere the middle to end of the movie was excellent
4 ||| The name of the book says a lot. This was well written and had many interesting points.I would tell everyone that is thinking about or who has had the weight loss opperation to read this book.There are many tips to help you when you are at a plato to help get the ball rolling again.
0 ||| Hey I found a really great way to bypass the content protection on these CD's. Open your favorite bittorrent client and download the mp3's directly. This will eliminate any trouble you have with the copy-protection mechanism. Thanks!
2 ||| I know it's written in an older more elegant style, but I found it a little difficult to follow at times. However, I still found it interesting it just took me some time to get through it. Frankly I had to stop reading it at certain times and read another book for a chapter or two
0 ||| This was a show I really wanted to succeed since I really liked the cast but poor writing, really impossible situations that were never explained and then the Pro-Gun Control rant (which served no purpose for the show) just ended it for me. When you allow poor writers to inject their political views into a script for no reason other than letting them air their political tendencies I give up! Maybe they should bring back Moonlight since this show may survive this season but in the long run it is gone.
0 ||| My dog ate the hole thing the second we gave it to her and shes still a teething puppy.now thats sad.!!!!!!
0 ||| Do not waste your money. I ordered 4 Boots No7 products, returned them all. Broke out my face, product was expired (that's what the bad smell is). I would never order any of these products again.
0 ||| Indecipherable rubbish.I bought this door stop because it is on everyone's list of Great Books. I read 200 or so pages and had to stop, I'd rather have a root canal without anesthesia than read the rest of it. I am a college educated English major, but how this random witlessness can share a shelf with Steinbeck, Vonnegut, Hemingway, Orwell or Forster and a number of other fine authors escapes me.
2 ||| Well I thought this would be a better movie it was not as funny as it looked even my daughter told me to turn it off!!
3 ||| Let's start with a disclaimer: I LOVE Venice. It is a beautiful, interesting, romantic city. If I could, I'd return to visit regularly. Berendt has done a wonderful job capturing the spirit of Venice and its people. While this book is nominally about the burning of the Fenice Opera House and the subsequent investigation and reconstruction, these events really just serve as framework around which a colorful exploration of the city in which it is built. The book is a series of chapter-long asides that delve into the colorful characters that inhabit Venice and make it such a interesting place. These asides weave these gossipy stories together with the vast history and iconic architecture of Venice to provide an amazingly intimate glimpse into the Venice that few tourists ever get to see. This is the next best thing to visiting Venice itself.
1 ||| (...) I have to say that I didn't really like this book. Repeat after me: self-insertion fiction is bad. Mary Sue characters are the bane of writing. This book reads like the kind of junky fanfiction (as opposed to actually good fanfiction, which easily surpasses this novella) found on the Internet. You know, when the author inserts herself not-too-subtly into the storyline. Not to mention, the characters are flat, cliche, and one-dimensional. Jessica is the stereotypical outcast, etc. etc. Blah blah blah.Here's hoping that her books actually improve...
4 ||| The DVD's are a great addition and compliment to the book. This would be wonderful for any cook from novice to expert.
1 ||| Was really looking forward to watching this movie since I enjoy Denzel Washington and have noticed that it is played on HBO and Cinemax quite often, but for some reason I was disappointed. Not sure why, but just could not get into the movie. The script did not seem very original and kind of bored me throughout the movie. Maybe because the picture quality on the dvd from early 90's was so poor that it made the movie look too old. Try to see it on one of the high-def HBO or Cinemax channels but otherwise if you skip seeing it don't think your missing much.Peter J. Miller
2 ||| "Aliens" was my favorite film in the series, so when they kill off Newt and Hicks in the opening credtis fo this one, I was very, very, very, ticked off! So Ripley is now stranded on a penal colony, convinced the big bad aliens are about to start killing everyone! The second-half of the film manages to redeem itself somewhat when we find out why the aliens have spared Ripley! David Fincher's 1992 film is certainly the weakest film in the (so far) four films, although Signourney Weaver struggles valiantly with the script's shortcomings!
0 ||| text message does not work, directions in a language I can't even identify, contact with ace photo, the vendor, was unproductive. not a good purchase experience at all.
4 ||| Every time I read her books I can't believe how gifted she is. She's wonderful, my favorite writer. The book is delightful
0 ||| This movie is classified as "Comedy and Romance," but there was no comedy at all. It was only a collection of unrelated fights, car accidents, and weird scenes; in addition to the loud meaningless sound effects. I did not get the point of the story, neither did the people who walked out early -- they were a lot. I regretted that I didn't leave and kept hoping that there will be some meaning at the end. Adam Sandler was fine as an actor, but if he kept playing this kind of weak stories, he will lose his popularity.
1 ||| I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something "deeper" and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you.
1 ||| If you like these kind of movies like I do then you probably have bad taste (peter jackson is a genius)as it is, but if you like this 3rd installment then you have Michael Bolton bad taste. NOTD3 had nothing that made the first two so good. There were no mass of zombies taking over a town, no zombies spouting off funny one liners and worst of all, how could they not bring back Frank and Freddie after making them the stars of the first two. The other reviews talk about what made 3 so much better than 2 is that the plot was so different from the 1st and I say that is exactly what makes this film so bad. The only way you will like this film more is if you got a necro thing going on.
3 ||| I found this book to be somewhat interesting. I admit it was hard to put down, even though it was very predictable. It's one of those things that you just have to keep reading to make sure that you're right.About the ending...I didn't like it too much. It left me with too much to wonder about. I figured it was going to be like that, but I can still whine.I suggest this book to those who like the fairy tale endings and such. It doesn't exactly end as a fairy tale would, but it'll help to escape reality for a couple hours.
4 ||| I have read this book twice in the last 5 days!!!! I absolutly LOVE it. i don't usually like love storys, but this one rules!!!! I would give 1,000,000 satars if I could!!!
2 ||| The two first chapters do a perfect job to present the topic. So you beggin the third with eagerness and ... you can't compile the code!Why? After a moment you realize that the all the reamaing code source is based on Sun's JDMK! The catch is that you must by this library for (actually) 6000$ !!!!Ouch... no where in the book presentation/introduction/library necessary was any mention of this.Conclusion: if you have JDML this is an excellent book, if not you will need to write foundation code!
0 ||| I just received this stand and went to try it on my Trek 4500 and did not fit, not only did it not fit, but put some scratched on my bike :o(. So now I'm stuck with this stand that will most likely not do anything for me. It's not worth returning it. I paid $8.49 for the stand and the same for shipping. $16.98 total. It will cost me about $5 to ship it back so I will only get $3 back after it's all said and done which to me is not worth it.If you plan on using this on a Trek Mountain bike look elsewhere, it will not fit and will scratch it. :o(
1 ||| Similar to another reviewer, from the appearance I expected this to be a right-angle driver that would allow me access screws in tight spaces by turning the end, without having to ratchet the driver side-to-side. This is not the case, very disappointed.
1 ||| I won't go into deep detail, because you've already read the reviews and you know--by now--the plot of the story. Well, I think the story could have been better, but it was a fun read, and it appeared to me Clancy wanted to broaden his imagination abit, taking us on a ride where the threat is real but--like a good comic book adventure, as done in the Batman series last year, I think--the execution of a super virus is exaggerated. Mr. Clark (Rainbow Six) would be better in comics and the movies than in this form. At least great artists would make it better off.Well, send any comments. I'm sure I could challenge them!!
3 ||| I saw this movie when I was a kid as a double feature to Monty Pythons "In Search of the Holy Grail". It left an impression with me that I will never forget. YES, it is campy, silly, corny and all that. But it is FUN. It has some great music and unforgetable perfomances. I can watch this movie again and again. LOVE IT!!!
1 ||| I've always been a Coogan fan but this was plain boring. I couldn't even get through it. The jokes seemed straight out of the 1920's.
4 ||| The plug is molded, which is great. It is very substantial and well made.Each wire is rated correctly (neutral and 12v for example being a heavier gauge than the turn signal).I would buy again
4 ||| This book is simply mesmerizing. One of my top 5 of all time!Like all of Jennings's blockbuster books, it grabs you and holds on. You become so enmeshed with the characters that you don't want their story to end. Jennings had the gift of making his characters human--fallible and real.His research must have been exhaustive, because when you finish this book, you feel a little disoriented in our own world--like you've actually been living in 16th Century Mexico, actually experienced Aztec life and the Spanish Conquest. You understand Aztec culture, their point of view. It's that real.Yes, as in all of Jennings's books there are gruesome scenes, and plentiful-sometimes quirky-sex, but the same is true of real life.I was just immersed in this book. Though I read it years ago, I'll never forget Mixtli and the others who inhabited his world.Excellent reading from an amazing writer!
3 ||| If you are buying this card for a windows 7 build you will have to look for drivers online other than that the card works fine. I'm playing online games like CSS on steam and others and it gives me no lag, our wireless modem is two rooms away and I'm getting 4 out of 5 bars which is good but not perfect. I wish they updated the drivers for MAC or hackintosh as some of you might know what that is. The latest drivers for their web side are from 08 for 10.5.x version. No snow leopard support what so ever.
0 ||| This product did nothing. You are better off with regular soap and just drying off well. Use a hair dryer if you must.
2 ||| This intriguing little collection of short stories is fun, but not my favorite of King's work. In the title story of this small collection, a young boy runs into the devil on a fishing trip. Pretty far-fetched, but King has the knack to make it seem real. The three other stories are a little less outrageous and deal with more mundane subjects. As always, the King character development skills are in full bloom here, but the plots of these stories don't have the usual twists and turns, and are more predictable. The narrators are excellent storytellers who add a lot to the interpretation of the stories.
0 ||| Seriously, I cannot fathom that people gush over this book.Essentially, what IDENTITY CRISIS was supposed to be was a 'whodunnit' for the DC Universe stable of characters. However, in a world of telepaths, sorcerers and men who shoot laser beams out of their eyes it falls embarrassingly flat on its face. Meltzer composes a story full of plot holes, bad characterization, and enough tired cliches to make any true fan of the genre wince.Quite possibly the only good comment I could make is that the artist is quite talented... other than that, not a lot to recommend.
3 ||| While I don't profess to be an expert on Sci-Fi/Fantasy novels, I did enjoy this book. My husband and I have created a habit of me reading aloud to him in the evenings. We started just before HP6 came out, going through the whole series in just over two months. Since we have finished that I have been looking for another series to read to him. One of our 17-year- old's friends let me borrow Eragon, knowing of our tradition and liking for this style of reading. Despite the sometimes juvenile feel, it was a wonderfully cozy book. Congratulations to Mr. Paolini for his courage to write his book. Who better to write a book about a young man coming of age while having to make adult decisions, than a young man.To those critics who don't like it, fine. Just remember, he will only get better with time and experience. Give him a chance.
4 ||| I was looking for this device for a while. I was tring to transfer some old file from old hard drive and it worked perfectly!!!
4 ||| Alice Munro is able to convey in twenty pages more character and depth than many people understand about themselves or their loved ones in a lifetime. She allows us to embrace our flaws and accept them with grace and understanding. She is an amazing writer and a voice of humanity to be admired.
2 ||| We watched this film with a mixed-ages group, and the reactions were decidedly mixed: the littlest kids were scared, the preschoolers liked it, and the older kids and adults were laughing when they weren't bored. While the story is terrific, the effects are too dated for today's sfx-jaded viewers. You'd be much better off reading the book.Also, the dvd extras are bad. There is a trailer but all other features (Cast & Crew, The Heroes, The Childlike Empress, The People of Fantasia) are just a screen or two of text. The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.You can see why this film was loved, but it's almost unwatchable for all but preschoolers today.
2 ||| These authors can write a good Victorian mystery. It helps that they delve into the history books, and use actual incidences that lend credence to their story. This book talks about Queeen Victoria's son, Albert's propensity for married lovers - some of the worst kept secrets from that era. Daisy was a real person and was actually involved with the Prince. The story is realistic, and the characters are niceley portrayed. I really like Charles and Kathryn and think they make a good detective team. The mystery behind the story is a good one, and the motive is "Oh so Victorian". I recommend this series to those that enjoy this period.
1 ||| I liked only 6 songs from their album. I had to listen to it for a very long time in order to like other songs, besides their hit. I miss blink-182. +44 is not good.
3 ||| This book is the definitive work on Columbus. Morison is famous for making the same journey that Columbus made with largely the same equipment in order to prepare for writing this book. His experience shines through in the detail thatMorison lavishes on his subject.As is the case with any great biography, Morison has become enamored with his subject, highlighting his strengths and successes while downplaying his weaknesses and failures, but you know that going into any biography and can adjust your interpretation accordingly.The story here is told very well, keeping the reader engaged and turning pages. Additionally, the book dispells many of the myths and common misconceptions about Columbus and really fills in a complete picure of the man.Well worth reading for any fan of history or biography.
4 ||| Even though this one was a bit more than some of the others out there, it is the most soft! I have talked to other moms who have different ones and they say the fabric isn't soft enough and they need to use a towel on top of it.
0 ||| This book is boring,terribly written and dryer than a year old cracker. Saying that J.K Rowling plagurised this is a sheer insult to a great writer. My advice to the writer is take a little more time to actually write a good book instead of tring to sue other people! Seriously, I felt like a genuis trying to read Barney's play time! Take my advice and save some innocent tree in a forest somewhere, and don't buy this book! If you want to read this ridiculous excuse for a book visit a library!
2 ||| Here, I have a billion ideas and I want to cram them all into your forehead all at once! A frenetic barrage. The design/calculation seems to have been to disorient, confuse, and flash as much as possible. Not new age (!) in any way. Not for heart attack people, high blood pressure, or anyone adversely affected by strobe, or light-speed wormhole travel. The music doesn't help--it's all hyper-upsetting. Lost opportunity art wise. Any worthwhile moment is rubbed out by the need for speed. Too bad.
2 ||| Better than expected. This is a Hollywood musical but even so it's a cut above most in that classification. It touches on the underlying problem of racial bigotry well enough for a musical.
0 ||| I rated this item one star since I had bad experience with taking it and withdrawal effects.The Ginko part is great, but it has L-Dopa which is precursor to dopamine , a major neurotransmitter in the brain. taking this supplement regularly will make you sleepy and if you stop it suddenly will cause depression symptoms.Please read more about the supplements content before buying any.
2 ||| Highlights: Cedric the Entertainer; lack of obscenity in a sensible script; witty/Lowpoints: Conventional, anemic script; unnecessary slapstick sub-plot; obvious message.Conclusion: I've said it before and I'll say it again: in this day and age, one reviews films on the basis of whether or not they stand out, at least vaguely, among the perpetual fabrications of contemporary mainstream cinema. "Barbershop" is not offensive, has amusing developed characters (a hilarious Cedric), a good ol' story about the power of loyalty, respect and devotion, and a PG-13 stamp. Despite a redundant sub-plot involving a stolen ATM-machine and lots of dumb slapstick, "Barbershop" is a cozy little film that will definitely initiate a sequel, but won't resonate.
3 ||| The only other Danielle Steel book I've read was Sunset In St. Tropez, which I didn't fully enjoy. But this book...I loved. It was very touching and even if you've never dealt with a loss, you still felt like you could relate with the characters. I didn't give it a 5 because I'm very picky about my books.
0 ||| I was underwhelmed. It may be that Matthews tuned into a sidhe, but his personal writing lacked gravitas for me, and what the sidhe had to say was way too general. I must have expected some fire, incisive thinking. At the very least a rip-roaring good yarn.
1 ||| The latest, and worst of the series. Jordan and his Editor need to go on a long retreat together and get the series back on track.I truly don't mind waiting for a good book. The series can recover from one lousy bookIt can not recover from multiple bad books.Tor has got to be willing to make Jordan rewrite--not just write--his books. And then they have to have an editor who's willing to work to get the series on track, and finished.
3 ||| For the most part I enjoyed reading this book. If you don't like to read about children in harm's way, though, this book is not for you. I could have done without the sexual abuse of a child part of the book. (there was not graphic detail of the assault More bad language than I care to read in a book, but not excessive or I would have tossed it. This is an older book by Coulter, and I had a hard time finding it.
0 ||| Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!
4 ||| Last season I picked up a great deal on motorcycle boots, but there was one drawback. In order to get the ones in my size, I needed to purchase the ones that were BLUE and Black. I had wanted Black on Black, but they were sold out. Thanks to Fiebings Leather Dye, I now have the color that I wanted from the very start ! I used acetone nail polish remover to deglaze the boots and then gave them three nice coats of Fiebings Leather Dye. I used a stiff art brush that had a 1/2" bristle which allowed me to work the dye into the leather around the hard plastic protective areas that the boots are made with. I then finished them up with a layer of Kiwi black shoe polish and they look brand new; and also as if they were Black all along.
1 ||| You have to wait too long to do anything with your dog. This game is so boring compared to Nintendogs! Save your money!!! I just got this game for my 11th birthday and I wish I could return it for something more amusing.
4 ||| This is arguably one of the best rap albums ever made. Every single track hits hard - with bass you can feel, and beats that make you want to get up and dance. I can remember going to parties back when this record first came out, where the only music was this tape... played over and over again... people just kept right on groovin' cause every track is phat!!Just about every song has been sampled extensively by more recent artists - a definite keeper.
0 ||| ad says its coded for the u.s. it will not play on u.s. players . faults advertising . what a shame.
4 ||| This was a gift for someone else. That said, I've heard nothing but good things about how well it works. The price is very reasonable, and its a nice sturdy steamer.
0 ||| These candles are not amber. They have a vaguely amber glow when you turn them on, but that is the only thing amber about them. The photo is clearly misleading. The candles are bright white and have huge clunky looking "wicks". Better looking white battery operated tea lights are readily available for better prices. I picked up several, priced two for $1, at my local grocery store. I'm returning these overpriced things and will never buy anything from Lily's Home again, as I feel their marketing of these was deceptive.
1 ||| I was very disappointed when I received this because it felt so light. I went ahead and put it up and it leaked. I tried again and again but couldn't stop it leaking so I returned it and Amazon was great about it. They paid for the return shipping too.
2 ||| So your interested in Wicca but live in a city not the country, then you want this. One suggestion though: skip over the chapters on deities and ghosts, that's where the majority of fluff is found.An enjoyable read, if you can read it to get the most out of it and not just take the face value.
0 ||| After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time.
2 ||| I'm sure the AAA North American Road Atlas 2007 is accurate and complete, but the print font is very hard to read. Compared to an atlas I've had for 15 years, the details aren't as clear as I would have liked. In other words, trying to find specific towns is a chore, mainly because of the crowded information. I should have ordered the large print. I did not do that in the first place because I thought all of the towns and cities could not possibly be listed with larger print. So, I'm stuck with this version. That's one negative of not being able to hold it in one's hands and paging through the entire book before purchasing.
4 ||| I owned an Oreck Hepa filter vacuum and this little $60.00 gizmo. With 5 cats in the house, I had to find a way to suck up cat fur and dust bunnies. Well let me tell you, this little guy is amazing.I have a cleaning lady and she didn't believe me--one use and she became a believe and has recommended it to her clients as well. The vacuum is light, stylish and really works.For all of it's downfalls (hair and dust getting caught around the filter at the top and the air that blows out the front) the vacuum is a gem.It is cheap enough that if it busts, I'll replace it with the same thing.I love it! It works great!
2 ||| I've never been a big Ashton Kutcher fan. I didn't like him in That 70's Show, so it took a long timefor anyone to convince me to watch this movie.I was blown away. It was one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. Do you ever think about fate? Isthere such a thing? That, no matter what choices we make, we are doomed to screw up our lives and the livesof our friends? The first B.E. was well-written, well-acted, and had me personally invested in the peopleinvolved. Highly recommended.The second movie, however, was nothing but a pale, poor shadow of the first. I was so bored, I wanted toturn it off halfway through, but I forced myself to finish it. It never got any better. Don't bother towatch B.E. 2.
4 ||| I found Plaza Sesamo On Demand when my daughter was about two months old. Ironically, it was the only show she would actually sit and watch and to this day, she is going to be one year next month, it is still her one and only show. Vamos a Cantar is one of two 55 minute DVD's I found online (and in stores) which is great because as she gets older I want her attention span to develop. The shows On Demand or on Saturday and Sunday mornings are only about 25 minutes. I recommend Vamos a Cantar for all children; while it is all in Spanish and I don't understand it, she seems to love it. The songs are cute, too. The product shipped fast and is of great quality so far and we have played it at least 5 times since receiving it about one month ago.
3 ||| The Beta Band's new release is more than an album, it's an experience. From the first chords of "Dry the Rain" to the murmers of "The House Song," listeners will be capitivated, if not a little perplexed. Although the inevitable Beck comparisons could be made, the Beta Band are very different from the country-pop star. Unlike Beck, they produce their own sounds, and their songs certainly aren't anything close to danceable. Yet their county-folk roots shine through, and mix with their rock n' roll power chords, making a truly enjoyable mix of sounds. The lead singer's strong, deep vocals add an edge to the songs, making the Beta Band's U.S. debut one of the most interesting albums of the year. It's one you can listen to again and again, but never hear it exactly the same.
2 ||| First off, I have experience with programming in C/C++ and a few other languages and I'm familiar with the basic ideas of object-oriented programming. But this book was not one I could start learning Java from. I ended up reading Dori Smith's Java 2 For The World Wide Web (the Visual QuickStart Guide) and had a much easier time figuring out the basics of Java. That book was easy to understand although it's extremely limited in scope.That said, I think the biggest problem I had with "Learning Java" was the steep learning curve at the beginning. The very first examples seem more complicated than they really need to be. That makes it very easy to give up and go looking for another book. If you already know a little bit about Java, then you probably won't be scared off but if this is your first time trying to learn Java, your best bet is to look elsewhere first and come back to this later.
2 ||| Both Chyna & Delia's situations teach you that safe sex is not an option but a requirement. Personal demons & lust will certainly lead you in the direction of danger. The message of what looks good to ya, may not be good for ya came across LOUD & CLEAR.
1 ||| If "Clan of the Cave Bear" was as mediocre as this book, its likely that the series would have ended right there. "Clan" was an excellent book -- and the others in the series were also very good -- but this book is very lacking in drama and repetitious to the point of boredom. The detailed research, which was skillfully woven into the story in earlier books and gave life and dimension to the characters and events, appeared in this book as lengthy descriptions which interrupted the story. As an Auel fan, I've eagerly read all of the previous books in this series, and was hoping that the negative reviews on "Shelters" were exaggerated. Sad to say, they're not. The only positive thing about this book is that Auel fans will have a chance to re-enter Ayla's world again after a long wait. I'm hoping that the next book will be better...
4 ||| This movie is the best cartoon ever. Autobots Vs. Decepticons in the war for Earth Megatron's plan after he already won Cybertron from the Autobots. And if you really want to see Optimus Prime and Megatron fight, this is your movie. And of course we can not forget about Orson Welles's voice as the evil monster planet Unicron. This is a must see movie for all ages. ( Including the uncut version too ). To find it you can search The Transfomers The Movie. ...
2 ||| "Blade Runner" is one of my favorite movies. I have owned it in every format, and when the "Director's Cut" DVD became available, I bought it immediately and sold my Embassy LD of the original theatrical release: I should ahve watched the DVD first. Several of Deckard's speeches have been deleted, most notably the one that he makes after the death of Roy Baddy. In addition, the end sequence, in which Deckard and Rachel are flying "North" has been removed. If this is the way Ridley Scott really wanted the movie to be, he was wrong.
4 ||| I use this every day for many years. Recently order inside pot.I also keep 10 cup version at my vacation home.
3 ||| For what Spike Lee is doing in this film i think he captured alot of it reasonably well, but it's got to be hard to make a film on one of the defining people in history. Malcolm x is a long film which is a good film but if you watch this excpecting it to be around 2 hours you should be warned in advance (it clocks in at around about 3. The film portrays many important issues that we live with today mainly that you should not judge a person by his past and that people really can change even against all odds. Though Malcolm x is not the most lucid of films it still makes good viewing and Denzel Washington himself makes a very admiral and well acted performace. This is one of the better historical films around.
3 ||| With most authors I won't bother with their re-released, less than full length novels, which are never quite as good, but Suzanne Brockman is always one of my favorites. So I decided to give it a try, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. It does lack some of the depth and all of the suspense of her newer stories, but it's a sweet romance, with an engaging plot and characters who are easy to care about. A good single-serving read.
4 ||| Enjoyed every minute. Being a woman in my late twenties, this book is s great reminder of timeless lessons on love, f as July and relationships.
2 ||| This is a wonderful and fun book! Even if you don't like any of the patterns, the stitch guide in the front makes it worth it. The biggest issue with this book is the binding. The book falls apart. This is my second copy. I had to keep collecting the pages and putting them in folders as they fell out. Im going to be putting the first copy in a three ring blinder now. Thats the only reason I gave it three stars. If the binding had been better i would have given it five stars.
2 ||| Memnto is impressive but in the end it dosen't leave much of an impression. Like a day in Leonard's life, it slips easily from memory, favoring sensation over insight and frisson of artificial confusion over any contemplation of human reality. Leonard's tatoos and photographs are a poor and unreliable substitute for the thick confusion of memory and Memento for all it's undeniable formal dazzle, is a triumph of mind in the absence of matter.
3 ||| love all the lee child books with Jack Reacher. Have read at least five and plan on reading the rest of the series.Would reccomend them to anyone who like mysteries.
2 ||| I automatically fell in love with this crib set but it is impossible to get the set. I have gone crazy and so have my shower guests looking for the items. The website doesn't even carry everything...BEWARE it's cute but you might not have the set so be prepared to fight and search for it!
3 ||| Well, it took me a few days to finish this book, I wasn't really able to get into it all that much, but once I finished it I started to like it more and more! Thinking back on all the quirky, eccentric folks of Higby, Mississippi, I was a little disapointed there wasn't more to read.The book is about Labor Day weekend in the small town, and the going-ons in some of towns peoples lives. The chapters are real short (3-5 pages) and each focuses on a different person. There's Carmen, in love with the handsome Tie who doesn't know she exists...Stewie and Marci, who's relationship is tested, Pastor Cullen who's son Clint falls from the Higby water tower, both of whome are trying to move on after the loss of a wife and mother, and so many more!I recommend this book as a light fun little read. You'll really enjoy the craziness and quirky drama of the folks from Higby, Mississippi.
3 ||| I ordered my size based on the sizing provided. I am able to hook on the first set of hooks. It does provide the curves I was looking for, but I NEVER forget that I have it on. The area below the waist was flipping up the first week that I wore it as I do deskwork all day; lately it hasn't but i don't know if that is due to additional weight loss or the fact that I was wearing clothes that did not allow it to do so! After wearing for several hours, I do experience a little soreness where the stays are pressing against my ribs. The lines of the squeem will show under a close fitting garment if your are near the upper limits of your size; and if someone is holding you, I believe they would be able to feel the support structure.
4 ||| Now I grew up listening to The Stray cats, Faster pussycat, ELO, The Dead Milkmen and Velvet Underground (among others); I love swing and Ska and this album rules!"Dirty Mutha Fuzz" is funky and funny, "Teenage brain surgeon" is classic punk as well as "Master and slave" and "Answering machine". "Drunk daddy" shows the swing direction that the band was growing into. This is real good stuff, call it Swing or Ska or Punk...loud, brash riffs and colorful horns coupled with a lead singer with the voice mannerisms of Mike Patton. If you like music with complex tones and textures and are sick and tired of the commercial machine sound, you will REALLY like this album!
4 ||| This is one of the most unique stories that I have read in a long time! Not since Stephen King started his Dark Tower series have I read a book this intriguing and different. The characters are all very interesting and the story is quite compelling. It was hard to put the book down! If you are looking for a great science fiction story that's a cut above the rest, this is it. Can't wait for the next in the series!
1 ||| This was a really boring book. You would think that a book about profiling serial killers would at least be interesting, but its not. He basically talks about his personal experiences in studying/profiling murderers. I bought this book for a profiling methodology class and I really wish I could return it.
3 ||| i think films like this although they are hard to watch are much better than those that glorify violence against women. i have seen some really weird reviews on horrornews.;net on a part called the 25 most distrubing films of all time. i dont think i ever want to see things like asian cat 3 films or august underground or some of the others. personally this film or last house on the left are about as rough as i care to get. although i did order 2000 maniacs recently. i think this film does have a moral and artistic merit and is making some kind of statement
4 ||| My introducation to the music of Dmitri Kabalewsky was through the old Horowitz recordings of the 3rd sonata (both live and studio version) and some of the preludes. The music here is not as phantasmagoric as Scriabin, not as lush as Rachmaninov, and certainly not as "modern" as Prokofiev. Yet Kabalewsky is very original and falls within the Romantic range of Russian pianism. His music evokes various moods that might remind one of Prokofiev but there also seems to be an element of the fantasy there as well, especially in the preludes. The Sonatas are tight pieces well worth frequent performances on today's concert stage. The pianist, Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy, is excellent with this music and plays it to the hilt. The sound and recording quality is very good as well. In all, a worth while CD for pianophiles looking for something new and good.
1 ||| I just finished this book, and as much as I liked the story, it dragged on too long, and was horribly predictable. It was not the brain candy many of us seek, built boring and common characters, and seemed to be repeating itself. As soon as you read the back, you already know that she's leaving the baby behind. And what ever happened when Maribeth left? I never found out. But with the predictability, I'd say she married that guy and had some kids. The book didn't really seem to be much about love, probably because the word showed up too many times. It's easy to read, not much thought required. Good for ages 10-16. Can be finished easily in a night.
0 ||| Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original, but in this case that's not necessairly a good thing. If you're not familiar with this band, this probably wouldn't be the best album to start with.
0 ||| Unable to use. Compartments too tiny and too deep to reach in to get earrings - and I don't have unusually large fingers.
2 ||| The product came on time and looks exactly like the picture.I can't imagine it actually costs that much to ship this case. Basically if you think you're getting some amazing deal on a camera case, keep looking. The shipping cost is outrageous. BUT, I bought it because I needed something to cover the screen on my camera, so it is functioning in the way I needed it too. And I didn't have to go to the store, so that is a bonus. And why is this thing deluxe?? What so deluxe about it? It has a strap hole and a pocket--the pocket is not big enough for the USB cord nor for extra batteries. Yeah, pretty deluxe.
1 ||| I thought the book was horrible cuz it was nothing that i thought was exciting and also cuz it was very hard to read i hated it but that is my opinion but everyone i asked said they thought the same thing i just said!!!
2 ||| I read some of this book in high school, but read it in its entirety recently to see how I felt about it as a 32-year-old adult. I enjoyed it somewhat.It is a good plot concept in general, with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However, oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children, because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes, although not excessively so. Because of this, it didn't suck me into it's world entirely, and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing, except to find out how it ends.Overall, this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it, but it may take some determination to get through it.
0 ||| The Book of Mormon has too many questions attached to it... Ifyou are a Mormon you will love this book, 99% of the rest of you shallfind it incredibly dull. Considering that the book repeatedly says itconsists of abridgements of ancient texts it is incredible it usessuch longwinded language. For example in the New Testament there is averse about God taking his children under his wings like a hen withchicks- in the Book of Mormon this is stretched out into severalrepeating verses. The language is a problem too. It is claimed thatthis book was written in 'reformed Egyptian' (a language unknown toall but Mormons), but why didn't these Jews use a kind of monumentalHebrew, Aramaic or Syraic? The translation is into 'Ye Olde English',Joseph Smith would have been better putting it into his own tongue. Hemakes mistakes such as talking about 'cherubims'- -im is a basicHebrew plural so it's like saying angelses!...
2 ||| The third series is great. It ventures deeper in to the lives of the cast and gives some rousing humor. Great gift for Earl lovers everywhere.
4 ||| Great story telling. So much story to follow, so much history to learn and wonder about how the human race can survive so much.
3 ||| This summer I decided to try Nicholas Sparks's books. I loved the movie, "The Notebook" and wanted to see if the book was as good/better (usually books are better). I don't know if it was because I remembered the movie so well but I found the book not as exciting/touching as the movie.
2 ||| I don't remember how these are presented, so the product may not be misrepresented if these issues are detailed in the description. They're smaller than normal and lack the stem (for lack of a proper term) that goes into a holder. They don't smell cinnamony and are easily broken. Good price though and do smell okay.
4 ||| This map is clear and informative, but more than that, it is beautiful to look at.Ordering it from the UK, I would have liked a quicker delivery option. But it arrived more or less when they promised -- if anything, a week sooner than I expected.Thoroughly satisfied with this purchase.
0 ||| From the name of the movie you will think that you will see real good horror movie. In fact the story was so bad .....it is not worth it to waste your time and money .....!
0 ||| Well, he's nuked a football stadium, biowarred the United States, fought desert storm II, put japan back to warring against us and it is no wonder this book fails miserably - what can he do for an encore? Well, he tries to drag us into a biowar two theme, but it just doesnt fly. Evil enviromentalists plot for 10 years to kill everyone but themselves to save the world - it just didnt generate any excitement.It would have been far better had he just let the Rainbow operation work its way through it's missions and left out the end of the world stuff.
1 ||| This movie is my all time favorite for no other reason than Tony Scott directing a Quentin Tarantino written script. The DVD is great... if you read the fine print. I purchased, by accident and my fault, a Region 2 DVD. What does that mean? I means only Region 2 players can display it. Where's Region 2, you ask? Ah, well... that would be Europe. I live in the USA which is Region 1. So it was my bad, but still wish a more active effort was displayed by the vendor to illustrate it was not a compatible DVD. Those are the breaks! I should've read closely, or at least wonder why it was so cheap.Caveat emptor! [Latin ~ beware the buyer]I felt I truly was romanced into purchasing.
1 ||| I think that this book is an ok book. The author describes the characters and scene well. He uses vivid words to describe the setting. He created a good plot and you could never set the book down. The characters are very adventurous. All the characters have their own personality with different characteristics.There are scenes in which you feel like you are really there. He makes the violent parts dramatic and scary. The author can get carried away at parts but he keeps you hooked through the whole book. You could almost cry at the end. He makes you terrified at violent parts, like you are watching everything happen. There are also some gross parts, when you wish you never read.
2 ||| I bought Targus cooling pad together with my Dell laptop . It has always been very noisy but did a fair job on keeping my laptop cool until yesterday when the fan just stopped working . Very cheap product and a terrible value for the money !
0 ||| Like others here, I found that the plastic receptacle on this baby came apart and would NOT go back together. I was fortunate that the sharpener did actually sharpen pencils quite well and it lasted for at least a year if not a little longer. Still, the only reason it held up was that I didn't try to empty it until it was too full to go on any longer; when I did, uh oh. (Obviously the sharpener was not getting a lot of heavy use either or it would've needed emptying a lot sooner.)
0 ||| This is not the original Moosewood cookbook I owned in the late 1970's/early 1980's. That cookbook contained a Cashew Chili recipe (that called for tomato juice)that was awesome and the reason I for which I had purchased this one. But it's not in there! Anyone out there have it?
3 ||| The title may seem kitschy, but don't be fooled -lots of intelligent advice in this book that extend far beyond just what men like (or don't).
3 ||| It's now 2007 and I bought this projector in 2003 and it's still running strong. I use it to watch TV and DVDs. About half a year ago the bulb popped and I had to replace it. This was expected to happen at some point, but HP doesn't make it very easy to order the bulb online, you have to call and then they can't find the part etc.. And it was quite expensive ($500). The only other complaint I have is the noise level of the fan. Ohter than that it runs perfectly and very reliably and has never failed me.
3 ||| I thought this book was very interesting in many ways. It really opened my eyes to the evil nature of human beings, and how, if we let it, that evil nature will come out. When they first land on the island, the boys are all dressed in a uniform, and they are proper, as their upbringing would cause them to be. There is, however, a huge difference in their appearance and attitudes at the end of the novel. All of the boys are dressed up like savages, with paint on their bodies. None of them care at all about rules or regulations or what is right or wrong. That shows just how easily humans can turn from good to evil. I enjoyed reading Lord of The Flies because there was usually never a dull moment. In every chapter, there was always something new developing. This was a very good book.
1 ||| the book itself is very informative and useful for a new trailer owner.the disappointment that I feel is having the supplier say that the book is new and receive a new book but that has been scored from top to bottom on the front cover. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! i tried to contact the supplier but they apparently don't have a useful email address.
1 ||| it amazes me that they can make products that simply don't work. This train can't even climb a hill with more than two cars attached. It derails almost instantly as it approaches curves. My son wants it to work so bad that he just squeals with frustration.
1 ||| Scarpetta is a detail freak in her work but has no concept of follow-through in her life. Things happen that are just ignored, it seems like the plots are a pastiche of paragraphs about Scarpetta which are forced into a chronology by her editor. The woman can write; I wish she'd take a story idea, outline it to figure out what she wants to say and where she wants to go, then go there. There's brilliance, and great sentences, solid characters, good science. But what holds them all together? The binding.
0 ||| i love the story of noah... i am so excited to see the whole thing done. so i finished it in no time, unfortunately theres one piece missing and to my frustration theres nothing i can do to replace the missing part. i was advised to get onother one or to just dispose it. WHAT?!!!.... and with a teary eyes, i just throw this puzzle in the garbage.. what good is the puzzle with one missing piece?! zzzzzzzz! =,(
3 ||| I enjoyed the chemistry between the actors throughout this film. But something seemed to drain out of the last 10 minutes.
4 ||| As a system administrator I have not found a more useful book for this distribution. Never mind this is my favorite distribution.
2 ||| One of my favorites from my youth is finally out on DVD, and while it is a real pleasure to see it with the new medium's visual clarity, I have to wonder who's dumb idea it was to add so much reverb to every musical number that the characters sound like they're singing in the Holland Tunnel. There's no such reverb on the cast recording - WHY was it deemed necessary for the DVD? It was only by accident that I discovered that by switching off the VSS mode on my DVD player, the reverb would shut up and I could actually enjoy the musical numbers. If you're having the same problem, try altering your VSS setting. Other than that (and seconding everyone else's reservations regarding the DVD's near total lack of special features - for this flick, I would have liked to have seen a sing-along, bouncing-ball version... or even a karaoke track) it's still a great flick.
2 ||| Some years ago husband, mother, and I went to Walmart looking for a scary movie. Mom told us that ROsemary's Baby is a good scary movie. So we bought it. We didn't like it. We thought it was boring. Well years later I just finish watching it and I thought it was a pretty good movie. I guess before we expected so much more from a scare movie. But for this being an old movie it wasn't bad.
2 ||| I bought this for my Treo 700p. When new, it looks reasonable. The material is worn down in some areas after 3 months of use. I didn't need the pocket inside for memory cards but the button has scratched my Treo right on the Treo logo. It is disappointing to buy a device for hundreds of dollars then to have a cheap case scratch it. I flipped my phone around in the case so it is now scratching the back.The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet. The strong pinching type has scratched my belts (since pinches so firmly) and has pulled apart the material of one belt. I prefer clips that reach around a belt to clip and hold the pouch in place.I will probably look for a better case for my Treo. Overall I can't recommend this case.Unfortunately most cases are poorly made and break easily. My search will not be easy.
0 ||| This is garbage, just like POINT OF ORIGIN. I really liked the first few Scarpettas, but the series has run out of ideas. Yet another conspiracy in the workplace. Yet more scenes chez Kay with Marino and Lucy acting out the same cycle of angst. Please just stop it! If you want crime writing in which the characters keep developing, try Lawrence Block. Or if you want fresh crime writing from the female perspective, go to Minette Walters.
0 ||| I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon. This is my third order of slacks. When I bought Dockers a couple years ago, they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly. This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly. These are far smaller than 36x32. If you order a size larger they might fit you, but I don't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place. The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit(tm) Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic. One other thing. I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine.
0 ||| Charged it like the directions said. Turned it on and used it for 5 minutes before it just shut off. Figured out that it would work if I jammed the button in but that's not how it's supposed to be and made it impossible to use. I don't recommend this brand.
4 ||| This movie is a classic and create the absurd thrash cult FRED KRUEGER!!!! This is BY FAR the best one with Fred, a true relevant thrash icon....WAY WAY cooler than Jason...
4 ||| I read alot of books and I just happened to pick this one up off the shelf. When I read the back cover and saw that this was his debut book, I was intrigued when I couldn't put it down. Not too many writers grab my attention like that. I normally get bored with books after about 60-90 pages. This book, I read in two days. There was so much suspence and twists and turns, I couldn't wait to turn the page to find out what would happen next. I would recommend this book to everyone. I can't wait to read his next book.
1 ||| Windows sees card fine but drivers wont install have surfed the internet trying to find drivers that work waste of money and to expensive to ship back no more amazon for where do i cancel.
2 ||| If you like Erasure, Pet Shop Boys or Depeche Mode, then you should like this. Very synthy this group and I think their goal is to continue to make 80s synthy music.
2 ||| I like this product and would purchase it again. Just a couple of comments: (1)in a beach situation the tent needs more weight I added thee medium sized zip-locked bags full of sand and that solved the problem, (2) the mesh front works well except the ties need some help a small paper spring clip solves this issue.
4 ||| I don't know much about this toy, but my son has enjoyed it very much. He has speech impairement and that was the reason I choose this toy.
1 ||| The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. If the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites.
2 ||| This video camera bag is a bit too small to hold all of the necessary equipment for today's video camera. The camera fits fine but there is no room for the battery charger and the camera manual (which you need to have on hand...unless you memorized yours!). There is also limited space for extra minitapes...I suggest you got for the bigger bag if you want to take all of your supplies with you when you travel!
1 ||| This always was a cheap piece of junk from Black & Decker. The new multi-volt charger is much better as you can leave the battery on the charger in case you forget it. It took so long to charge a battery where as the newer model will do so in one hour. This never should have been put on the market.
4 ||| In 1924 theatre owner Marcus Lowe organized the merger of three studios. Louis B Mayer was named vice president of the new company and a 25 year old "boy wonder" Irving Thalberg was named head of production. The studio chose for its mascot a roaring lion and the phrase "Ars Gratia Artis": "Art for Art's Sake". The studio was called Metro Goldwyn Mayer. A year later the studio and Thalberg scored their first triumph with Ben Hur. The film set the standard for exelence on which MGM made its reputation.With fine acting from Ramon Navvaro, Technicolor sequences, and the great chariot race, this silent classic is still impressive today and is included in this set. As a bonus, you also get the crappy 1959 remake.
0 ||| I love this movie and so does my daughterbut when we got our movie it had the wrong bar code.I threw the package away that it cae in so I guess that some money out the window.
3 ||| Pros: Easy setup, good reception (at least in San Francisco), very portable, nice little remote.Cons: Color and styling are sort of ugly, sound quality is good but not great, would have loved a rechargable battery instead of using 8 C cells when it's not plugged into an outlet.Overall, I'm quite satisfied. I'm using it with the XM Roady XT, and it's nice to have the option of hooking that unit up to the car or home stereo, too. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to XM and wants the option of portability.
3 ||| Having worn out two original 1970 cast albums, it's hard for any other version to live up to comparisons. Whether or not you agree with the pared-down concept, the execution was eye-opening, fresh and contemporary. And no matter how high expectations were built, we still were stunned by Raul Esparza's Bobby - one of the most memorable performances of this generation.
1 ||| Written with style. Toole definitely had talent, but it takes more than vivid descriptions to make a great book. I found the book utterly depressing. It gave me the feeling I get after a David Lynch film, like I need to take a shower. I kept trudging through it because I had heard such good things, but the good things never came. (...) How can so many people love this book so much? I guess the world would be pretty boring if we all agreed on everything.
4 ||| Came as promised - in great shape - very fair price - and delightful sketches from our state's past. What else can you ask for?
0 ||| This decoration was my favorite for 3 weeks until it grew dull colored and developed blackened spots on it that resembled mold. I removed it from my tank.
0 ||| PS3 can not reach 1080p with this cable, everything else being equal, the same PS3/HDTV works fine with the Monster cable. Of course, the price is in no comparison anyway.
0 ||| Not worth watching. The very peculiar it doesn't even mention in the show where they are and which Police Department. Very Generic.
1 ||| I have owned older Polar hear rate monitors, my favorite was the S210. Is really cheaply made, belt is integrated into the watch, which is a very bad design, since the belt will be worn out with a year of usage. Overall, I think Polar products have gotten worse over the years. I am glad to see competitor like Garmin with much better products capturing the market they deserve.
4 ||| I loved the music for this game and the 20 bucks i spent on this thing when i bought a few years ago was well spent. Its the oldest game for my computer that i still play, probably because there are no sequels, but i burnt the music to a cd and can listen to it in my car. For the 3.50 the game is going at now you might as well just buy it to try it, then again you have to factor in shipping cost, but all in all a great game especially for under ten dollars.
0 ||| I purchased this Ironing Board Hanger cause I have a 'Y' shaped board like the one in the picture. When you hand the board on it, the hanger twists a little thus not hanging flat against the closet door. Also, the whole contraption hangs too high up so the door won't even close when the actual iron is on it.
3 ||| This book will keep you on the edge ok your seat right up until the very last page!!!!
1 ||| I wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this unit. It has lasted about a year, started buzzing, then just cut off with only my desktop, a phone and and small lamp attached.
4 ||| This cult classic, well-known among professional philosophers,sketches the history of Western philosophy and theology in a series ofcartoons involving . . . pigs! One meets the Stoic pig, hip-deep in snow, defiantly facing the winds of adversity; the Anglican pig merrily tricylcing along the Via Media; the Rousseauean "noble savage" pig; the Nietzschean Superpig; the Kierkegaardian pig making a leap of faith; and so on. I saw the first edition of this book in a friend's collection over 20 years ago. When it briefly came back into print in 1992, I bought 5 copies, of which I still own 3: one to lend, one to keep, and one which, someday, I might give as a present.It should be required reading in every Intro to Philosophy course.
1 ||| In 1988, on Oct. 30, was the day I first heard this album. It is now forever linked to not only great punk rock for me, but forever linked to my teen-age halloween memories. Nearly 20 years after I first heard it, and 20 years since its release, 'Horror Epics' still remains one of the great 80's punk albums and the only political/ghoul punk album I can think of. It's a great way to start your Exploited collection and a must for a curent collection.
3 ||| An interesting CD which gets better each time I listen..Being used to the basic home grown Cajun style of four or five people standing around an echoey room, the 'Big (ish) band' style of the CD came as a bit of a shock - initially somewhat disapointing.. But now, I love it!
3 ||| If you like battles against ultimate evil, religious overtones, and special effects - with a twist, rent Constantine. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief. Yes, you have to accept somewhat two-dimensional personalities. But if you get past that, you get a nicely shot, tense, supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters. Most folks will have never heard of Constantine or Hellblazer, on which the movie is loosely based, but it's fine if you haven't. The movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night.
4 ||| This book is not a book that you can relate to if you don't live in New York and aren't in the fashion industry. It is fiction. The book is well written and the story keeps flowing.Definitely a page turner. A good fantasy book about glitz, glamour, greed and egos.
1 ||| it is perhaps appropriate that the bulk of this novel takes place in a musty old Spanish church in the act of being restored, as the writing a plotting here are as musty as the material. It pains me to say this, as I loved Perez-Reverte's "Flander's Panel" and "The Club Dumas". But what those two books carried in flair and style, this one replaces with dull characters and a plodding pace.
2 ||| If its action you want then you won't be disappointed, it fires up 'movie style' in the first chapter. However this novel lacks the depth, complexity and techo-education that are the usual Clancy hallmarks. Like other reviewers I found the plot too derivative of Executive Orders and the prose far too repetative. I guess now that Jack has made President there just wasn't anywhere else for him to go and we have to make do with the less sophisticated Clark and Chavez!
1 ||| From First to Last used to be a band about passion and not fashion I love FFTL don't get me wrong but in this days how music business it's just crap, I remember seeing this band with their old singer before they became "oh so famous" and they were one energetic band I've always liked but after they got their new singer it's not the same thing as old FFTL it's just like every other band in this days like MCR, TBS, etc... if you ever have a chance go listen to "Aesthetic EP" by FFTL and see the difference between each one of them and you will see what I mean...and this album has too many soft songs too, 1 or 2 soft songs are not bad but there is a lot more and there is almost no screaming as in their last EP what a dissapointment....
1 ||| I don't understand why this keyboard isn't equiped with a modern day connector or at least emphatically warn customers of the need for one when they order. The keyboard works fine once you can hook it up but my buying experience was less than stellar getting a product that wouldn't work out of the box.
2 ||| Dune is a masterpiece to some, but it is pure drivel to others. I began reading it with high hopes. About 10 pages in, I got drowsy and set the book down. I found it extremely hard to pick it up again. In the end I got about 150 pages into it before realizing I should only read ten pages a day (and read another book full time) or just quit it altogether. I have yet to take either initiative (although I have started a different book). I can appreciate Herbert's world building, but the pace is incredibly slow and the writing itself is pretty abysmal. It's just not my cup of tea. Many others seem to enjoy taking their tea with a large dollop of mélange. In my opinion, it's a love-hate affair and I'm one of those indecisive types who are stuck in the middle.
2 ||| I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would. Younger people might enjoy this and so I have not much to say about it.
2 ||| This movie was a disappointment to me. I received this movie for a Mother's Day gift. I'm only giving it a 3 star because I love Adrian Paul.There were a lot of silly "one liners" from Bokeem Woodine. I have never seen a movie with Woodine before and I hope I never do again. The love interest between him and Bai Ling just doesn't feel right, too fake, no true emotion.I wasn't used to hearing Adrian Paul with an obviously fake accent. I'm sorry, it just didn't fit him, I am so used to his beautiful English accent.It's worth watching as a movie rental; if you have nothing else to watch.
1 ||| I liked the story, but found the characters at times lacking, the story predictable, the names bazaar and well, weird. There were holes in the story where I could see a plot twist, yet there wasn't one. It felt like a really good first draft of a novel, that maybe her editor didn't have time to do a thorough read through of. This is my first Linda Howard novel - so forgive me if this is an exception to the rule about her work.
4 ||| "A candidly honest and insightful eye opener into the world of dating violence, this book is a must-read for all teenage girls!"Heather Molnar, Miss Teen Maryland 2001
3 ||| This item is very nice for the price. It would have received 5 stars, however, the glass is VERY fragile! They are very thin. After the set was used the first time we had 2 of the 4 glasses in tact. They were broken while sitting in the sink. We were just not careful enough when washing them. I would purchase these again even knowing how fragile they are.
2 ||| Depends on your preference, but i found these gloves to be not flexible enough to feel comfortable. The leather linings are the ones causing this.. The item description matches the real product. However, note that it says on the puma package that it is 'goalkeeper gloves' - but looking at how they are made, these are definitely not good for goalkeeping (but it is understandable for these gloves to be as inflexible if they are to be for goalkeeping.) Also, if you are in cold climate these pairs won't protect you from getting cold.
0 ||| Is it just me or were you thinking about Damon Wayons Homeless Guy from the T.V. show In Living Color, every time Mos Def opened his mouth. Man was that ANNOYING, or what. Shallow people who like cop movies will dig this one. This is way to played out for me....a crooked cop out to whack a guy before he testifies. How cliche.
3 ||| larger than i expected and lasts for a long time,easy to clean,and a fun target to practice your aim.
2 ||| I use it mostly for tea, not coffie. I bought the use your own coffie attachment, works good, but seems the mount of tea I use for one cup, I can make a whole pot the traditional way. I use the k-cups for tea and hot coca and they work fine, but very pricey. All in all nit a bad machine. Can be programed to come on before you wake up and shut down by itself. that way all you have to do is worry about the water level
2 ||| Overall the Pampers Baby Dry diapers are pretty good. They are a good price compared to Swaddlers or Cruisers. The big bummer is that I find the tabs don't stick well & tend to come undone at times, creating leaks. I used to get these from the Amazon Warehouse Deals, as they were a good price, but the customer service is HORRIBLE. I was sent a box that had been urinated on (I'm guessing by a dog) and returned to Amazon. They then sent it out as a Warehouse Deal. I don't need diapers that have already been pee'd on!
0 ||| A very deceptive title. Ian Rakoff worked on only a few episodes and his accounts are limited to a few encounters with McGoohan and trivial gossip around the show. The book should've been titled "Ian Rakoff: A bunch of stuff I did that had nothing to do with the Prisoner." Maybe 25% of the book is about working on the show, the rest is about his career before and after which makes for poor reading. I didn't even finish it because after the sections about the Prisoner it completely lost my interest. Anything worthwhile about the Prisoner has been written about in other books. Avoid dissapointment.
1 ||| THE STIFFS WERE A GOOD SOFT BAND.THIS CD IS SUPPOSED TO BE A COLLECTION OF THEIR BEST WORK. BUT MISSING IS HERE ARE THE SONGS 'D.C.RIP' AND ANOTHER GREAT TRACK FROM THAT 7". FOR CAPTAIN OI!TO LEAVE OUT SUCH AWESOME WORK IS DISTURBING. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS RELEASE. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TITLED"THE STIFFS_LOVE SONGS COLLECTION". THE BAND ITSELF RATES BETTER THAN 2 STARS, BUT NOT HAVING THE SONGS IT SHOULD OF HAD,GREATLY DEPRECIATES THIS CD.
3 ||| The Great Dumbbell Handbook is very well put together and includes enough exercises to allow the reader to put together a comprehensive weight lifting program using free weights. The instructions are very well detailed and are documented through photographs to illustrate the proper techniques for each exercise. This book is for people who are just starting to work out with free weights or those who looking to add more routines to their free weight program, people who have been working out with a trainer or are already experienced working out with free weights will probably get very little from this book.
2 ||| The book is a glorification of the irrational, if that is a worthy aim for people in the present world. I suppose there are many individuals who, in mass society, feel so insignificant that any fantasy activity is appealing to them, but whether it really will help them along the path of self-improvement and to find meaning in life, I seriously doubt. The so-called Spanish of the author hardly qualifies as Spanish for its many flaws and shortcomings, and I suppose that her assumed Hispanic aspect is as shallow in meaning as her vulpine activities. Men, however, may find reading this tome of value in determining which females to avoid (like the plague).
0 ||| This is the worst of the four. If they hadn't killed off the three wonderful characters introduced in Aliens it might have been an ok movie. But no, they make their ship crash on this planet of "celebate" prisoners and make Ripley the only survivor. And then, we get to watch as they slice open Newt's chest to see if there's a chestburster inside. And the rest isn't even worth talking about. I was really disappointed with this movie and you will be too. Rent it(if you must)first before you buy it.
1 ||| I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own.
2 ||| I really had high hopes for this product but am a little disappointed. It doesn't always find the server so you have to restart a few times before it will work. The video playback is jerky, that was the main reason I bought this thing so I could watch video on my tv and it is a neither smooth process or a good quality (and yes the video is fine on the PC). I thought that these problems might have been because of my wireless network so I ran cable and hooked the thing directly into my router, it made no difference. It works great for music, but I have yet to figure out how to get it to view pictures. I hope they can work out the bugs on this thing someday because it's a great idea.
3 ||| Ok, for all those people who aren't good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. NBA 2k3 is a great game. I could do the franchise mode all day! There is great graphics, and great gameplay. The ESPN setting makes it even better. For sega sports fans this is a great buy!
4 ||| Having purchased this box set on a whim, I am glad I did! This set brings back great memories. It does however have a voice edit on the Ho-Po show. I believe however, that the person who thinks that the "shadow of the Condor" show was edited has mistaken this episode with "The Dark Tower". The Dark Tower has the scene that shows the Nazi soldier throwing a hand grenade at the Quest team from his plane when they are trapped on the side of the mountain. I don't recall a scene ever in"shadow of the condor" that has the pilot throwing a grenade. I may be wrong but I believe this set is complete and unedited except for the voice editing on the Ho-Po showing.You wont be disappointed with this purchase. It will bring back many memories and is quite to fun to watch even as an adult after all these years. Get it you wont regret it!
4 ||| They don't make em like this anymore...great choreography, terrific Gwen, a wonderful musical! See it!
2 ||| This is an amazing, beautiful cartoon, but the DVD treatment borders on calous. It suffers from lousy video quality and a brutal pan-and-scan fullscreen treatment that frequently leaves both characters in a converstaion hanging off the edge of the screen.Still, it's the only Last Unicorn we're likely to get, so go buy it anyway.
0 ||| Turgid, tepid, tautological, terrible. Predictable, profane, putrid. Chauvanistic, racist and reactionary claptrap by a Clancy who has exceeded his use-by date. Success has obviously bred contempt for his readers. Thank goodness it was a present - it's only unfortunate that my son wasted his money on this dreck.
1 ||| I bought this and did not realize that this book is NOT for a small loaf. I have a 1lb loaf machine .The recipes are all for a medium 1-1/2 or large 2lb loaf. NO SMALL RECIPESYou cannot just halve the ingredient amounts, unless it's truly a large, pretty full 2 pound loafThe larger recipes are too large for the small machine but too skimpy if you halve them.I don't want to practice getting the amount ratios.Also, Almost all the recipes call for Gluten.
1 ||| I bought this device in the hope that I would be able to put it to use with more than just salad, to rationalize the somewhat inflated price. I assumed it would be effective in drying things other than leafy greens, and now my hamster is dead.I would like to have been able to review its ability to dry spinach or lettuce, but the spinner's failure in the hamster-drying test was such that the spinner is no longer fit for use with food (or much of anything else, I imagine).Also- and I am trying to phrase this delicately- the spinner is not very easy to clean. Again, though, this could be a usage-specific problem and may not reflect situations where it is used in a manner that more closely adheres to its intended use.
4 ||| Using a perfect model, this books first introduces characteristics of GOOD solutions, then step by step, it describes triz problem solving tools (and strategy development tools as well) all integrated into each other.As stated in the title, it's a simplified book so you can't find some advanced tools like su-field modeling in it.
4 ||| At last you have a means of answering these brainwashers when they next pitch up on your doorstep. They changed the bible to suit themselves and are well trained in quoting the passages they wrote to support their message. Most people don't look at a bible from one year to the next and don't know enough to show these people how wrong they are. David Reed gives ammunition to fight back with.My wife nearly fell for their slick brainwashing, I'm buying a copy for her, and possibly more for the local Kingdom Hall.
4 ||| This is my 2nd Keurig, I have one at work and finally decided to get one for home when I saw the price for this one. Great value, shipping was as explained, slight dampness of the shipping box and coffee maker, just let it dry out naturally and you are all set. All-in-all very happy with purchase.
4 ||| This book appalled me- in a good way. I found the concept of a patriarchal dystopia where women are forced into inescapable castes so disturbing that this book still comes to my mind very often. Atwood did an amazing job portraying a society in which a woman's value is determined by her fertility, which leaves her with no access to education, career options, or personal goals. This book also portrays a great irony of the more zealous aspects of feminism; there is such a thing as being too protected from danger.
1 ||| I am very disappointed with the performance of this lens. I expected better from Canon since I am a long-time Canon user and have many lenses by them. Images are soft to semi-sharp at all focal lengths. 300mm is never sharp. When enlarged even 25% all images go very soft and become noisy and would be useless for printing. I get much better results with all my other Canon lenses. For the price of this lens I expected much better. My son has a cheaper canon telephoto and gets better images. Looking at the reviews others have written on Amazon, it may be that this particular lens has an inherent optics flaw. The IS works fine in both settings, but the images are still not crisp.
0 ||| I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word "Classic" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was "meaty" (whatever that is), "deep", and "powerful"; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle.
0 ||| poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing.
0 ||| Ok - the statue arrived (very slow shipping by the way) and I buried it.No house sale yet! damn.Well it can't all be his fault right?oh well.
3 ||| Five short and sweet tunes. Not the greatest recording ever, but more than likely worth whatever you might pay for it.
3 ||| Very nice film and Clint Eastwood's best work. Noteworthy performances by both Swank and Freeman earned them their most deserved Oscars; however, I'm not so sure about Best Picture. I still think Ray should have been the winner on that.Nonetheless, the performances in this movie were well done without being overdramatic. I found the trailer trash relatives to be a bit too caricature, but the intimate "father-daughter" like moments between Swank and Eastwood were very touching without being overdone.Worthwhile movie and Eastwood's best.
2 ||| This ball could do more damage than a cue ball! It is extremely dense and heavy. Don't get me wrong, it is a durable ball that is great for bigger dogs that seem to destroy toys immediately (like mine). I'm just saying that a dog, person, or anything else could get injured badly if directly hit by this thing.
1 ||| I was disappointed in this book. It was not up to the usual standards of Kellerman's work.... no flow for me. I have been an Alex Delaware fan since he first started years ago... this is the first book of Kellerman's that left me cold. Hope this isn't a trend.
3 ||| This is an unusual book, but it sure keep your attention. This story kept my attention throughout the entire book.
1 ||| Everyone else is doing it, why not Blade Runner!Where's the Special Platinum Collector's Extended Director's Editorial Criterion Collection Super Duper Edition of this CLASSIC film?Heck, even George Lucas has given in and started releasing the Star Wars movies (the new ones, of course) on DVD.This DVD is terrible. It was among the first releases on the new DVD format, and by contemporary standards, it's just awful. No remastered audio or video. No special features. The only thing that could make it worse would be if you had to flip the disc part-way through the film.For the love of all that is good and holy in this land, PLEASE give us a SPECIAL EDITION of Blade Runner!
4 ||| As a single person I rejoice in the goodness of God who has granted me the opportunity to read this book before I have a family. I can now look ahead with great confidence knowing that I have the tools to be a good parent, to raise children well, and that I have a God who is faithfull and has given me everything needed to be a "succesful Christian parent".
0 ||| Don't bother.Feels like it's made of some plastic material (though I'm sure it's not). Just looks cheap.I ended up buying a vintage leather belt which was much nicer.
4 ||| Everyone knows this film is one of the greats of cinema, and this BluRay presents it in the best transfer I have ever seen. Reminds me of the quality of restoration work done on the Bond films. Fantastic!
3 ||| The basic premise that decolonization is a violent phenomenon still seems pretty revolutionary to me, as do his attempts to analyze the effects of colonization on the psychology of the native. I'm not sure if I buy his 3-step method by which colonized people develop their own culture, the clinical way he describes the native turning first to then from the colonizers culture, ultimately arriving at this almost Hegelian synthesis just feels too simplistic, too much like generic agitprop. His conclusion, that the third world has to rise to the task of protecting and taking back liberal humanism from European hypocrisy, (and that they have to do it on their own terms) might be overly idealistic, but its a kind of idealism which is very hard not to agree with by the time he's done making his case. It's easy to see how this became a big influence for people like Malcolm X and Edward Said.

4 ||| It was the most fun game of my ten year old life. The only thing I didn't like was the BOSS challenges. The bonus items gave the game a nice twist. Kirby could be any color depending on the bonus colors you have. I beat the game in a month and I did not care that I was neglecting my other DS games.
2 ||| As one of the first VA novels I read it was interesting to see the simularities to other books, however, it has its own discrete story behind these. The twist is believible and keeps you asking what happens next. But why are families so willing to take back children given away? Perhaps they feel guilty but the stories would hardly happen in the real world. Maybe it needs a touch of reality.
4 ||| At first I did not want to buy these because they were the pyramid brand, and I hear lots of bad stuff about their products. I just went ahead and bought these to put in my ride, and I was pleased with the results. The sound quality is very good, and when I turn the music all the way up they don't get distorted because they have built in cross overs and that's another plus. These speakers are good if you want to add more highs, to your ride so people can hear you coming down the block.
4 ||| This is an exccelent product, I work maint for a vary large company.I work around powdered milk production machines.This bag keeps powder away from my tools after I sanitize them.I love it. Im looking into getting the rest of my maint crew to buy one.all 45 of them.
4 ||| EXCELLENT!!!! NEED I SAY MORE?? TAKE A LOOK AT THE LED ZEPPELIN IV REVIEW PAGE...THERE'S A BIG DEBATE HOTTING UP BETWEEN THE ZEP AND FLOYD. I THINK US FLOYDIANS WOULD WIN!!!!
0 ||| I had the required software for an update (according to the update software). I had/have MS office Pro 2003 with publisher 2003 and the software would not load. I got a message of "can not file a file" and the install set-up would stop and exit.Piece of crap!!! Lucky the seller was willing to give me my money back.
0 ||| I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff. The acting and storyline is horrible. In the nudity shots she looks like she is wearing a black bear skin rug on her private parts. Don't waste your money on this one.
1 ||| I know, I know...I'm just a stupid high school student who's brain has been fried by television. I was forced to read this novel in 11th grade and I couldn't finish it. Must be because I play too many video games, right?I'm a freshman in college now, and I still hate Dickens. Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; "A Connecticut Yankee" was a page-turner for me, and "Huck Finn" is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off.
1 ||| The literature leads you to believe it works with the treo 755p. NOT UNLESS you use the bluetooth adapter. It seems to connect since both phone and the earphones indicate connected but it does not respond when music is played. To make it work you have to use the blue tooth adapter (which you shouldn't have to do since the phone is bluetooth). In addition, the stereo jack with the adapter does not fit in the small earplug jack outlet in the phone. You have to purchase a jack adapter also. Very disappointing.
1 ||| This CD isn't bad if you like repetitive lyrical phrases without meaning, looping samples, speech that repeats and says nothing (like "pushin' out" over and over and over and over again). I can perceive some talent somewhere in here, but this group is making music CDs that mostly lack music. Where's the music?Some songs start, seem to have potential to develop into something, and then don't. Now, having said all that, there are a few worthwhile cuts, a couple that are quite good. So ultimately, if you like to have more music than incoherent mixes of various sounds, then you have simply to decide whether or not you're willing to pay $3 or $4 a cut.I'll admit: maybe I just don't get it, but if you can find a place to sample everything on this album I think you'll find I'm vindicated.
4 ||| I've bought every version of GWTW (VHS, laser, and now DVD), and this new one is the BEST! Just to be sure, I got out my laser version (CAV) and compared it. The DVD wins hands down. One particular example really stands out for me--that scene at the Atlanta bazaar has the most beautiful Technicolor I can remember.It IS disappointing that there are no extras, other than the trailer and the enclosed booklet, but that can be forgiven for the most wondrous COLOR. Too bad they don't use real Technicolor in movies anymore.This DVD deserves an honored place in one's library!
0 ||| I haven't actually listened to this CD. But, this is not the John York who played with The Byrds from 1968 to 1969. This John York CD has been linked to this along with a book on The Byrds. It's a different guy. Just thought you should know.
1 ||| The story of William Carey is an inspirational one. Unfortunately, this dramatic portrayal contained in this video doesn't do the story justice.
0 ||| i had a similar experience as previously indicated. in fact i ordered both the unabridged and abridged versions of this product and received the exact same product (despite the fact that the allegedly unabridged version was 2X the cost.) if you'll notice, the picture are confusing and therefore you don't know what you will be receiving. now i am looking elsewhere for an unabridged version as the information on amazon is inconclusive and ultimately unhelpful.
1 ||| This CD isn't worth the hype it has been given. It's okay but that's it. Just okay. Her messages are clear but too preachy in my opinion.
1 ||| There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute.
2 ||| I am very sorry people who like this girl,for real she's O.K to me.SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sorry what I said before.
0 ||| I had waited for a long time for this CD to come out and I was really looking forward to buying it. I'm no young kid (age 69) and think he has a beautiful voice, however, I was so disappointed in "Measure of a man"! I was hoping he would have some of the songs from "Idol" or at least popular songs that I had at least heard before. I still think he has the most beautiful voice that has come along in a long time, but I'll tell you, before I buy his next CD, I'll sure make sure to look at the selections of the songs before I buy it!! I think he should pick his own songs next time instead of letting other people!!!!
2 ||| 3 1/2Sax-solo-centric songwriting sags Sonny's selections from potential transcendental to appreciative predictability.
4 ||| Absolutely objective. Wonderfully insightful. Footmarked to the hilt.This is the most useful, objective, engaging source I've found on the topic.
3 ||| I liked this movie, Great Plot, Great movie, Great Setting.One of his best movies ever.Dont mess with Steven in the movie.
3 ||| Easy to turn, easy on the hands. Much better than the cheap metal-handle ones I had purchased previously. One minor complaint: I put it in the dishwasher with the blade end down, and a little white stuff then leaked out of the long handles and stained some of the metal. I think it is just glue residue. I cannot scrub it off. Fortunately, the white stuff doesn't come off on cans or food, and it hasn't affected the usability. I cannot remember whether I put it on the top rack or the bottom rack of the dishwasher.I would still buy it again, because it is better than others.
3 ||| It's a good version of some great works by a wonderful author. There are a few mistakes here and there, but I won't complain too much since it was free.
3 ||| I finally started reading this book on Kindle and find it difficult to put down. It is very easy reading and light. The characters r interesting and very relatable.
3 ||| This Keyboard protector is GREAT for protecting your keys. It actually feels really good to type with also. I wouldn't have any gripes about it if i didn't have cats. They cat hair that is floating around my house all the time gets immediately stuck to the protector and is difficult to get off unless you take it off and wash it. I'd have to do that almost everyday if i wanted to keep it cat hair free...Otherwise it's great and i would highly recommend buying it.
3 ||| Definitely a WONDERFUL movie, Sliding Doors, brings to the screen two parallel stories unfolding simultaneously involving an English girl living and working in London.The movie opens a window into other possibilities and "what ifs". It is a film about human relations, friendship, trust, love, and inner strength.Gwyneth Paltrow (who is GORGEOUS), John Hannah, and the rest of the cast give it their 100% themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least (the chemistry is AMAZING)!The only negative point is Gwyneth Paltrow's British accent, which surprisingly, is not convincing at all!Sliding Doors does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face. Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment. It is a movie worth watching!
2 ||| I watched this show with expectancy having heard about it all my life. The sound quality is clear but inaudible. Had to listen keenly to hear what they were saying. I enjoyed it and am now in love with Humphrey myself. Don't know that I would watch it again but I certainly appreciate the fundations set by this movie which is indeed a classic.
4 ||| Pampers is the best brand available as compared to others pampers is the best but buying pampers from amazon made my life easy.i dont have to rush to the stores to buy the same box with a higher price,and absolutely loved amazon when i saw the box delivered after 1 day.
0 ||| I am a huge fan of Auel's earlier books. I enjoyed reading about the certain discoveries of Ayla and Jondalar, the descriptions of the landscape, etc. I looked forward to this book for many years, but it did not live up to my expectations.In a 1,000+ page book, the entire goal was to get to the Summer Meeting. It took 700 pages for Jondalar and Ayla to walk into camp, then finally make the journey to the Summer Meeting. What happened in those 700 pages? Not much.However, there were plenty of name recitals: "Ayla of the Zelandonii, daughter of the Cave Bear, wife off Jondalar the Traveller and Flint Napper, friend to Whinny and Racer, subject of boring book, creation of Jean Auel", etc. My guess is that if you took out all of the name recitals, you could knock 100 pages off the book.Sadly, a tedious and uninteresting book. Auel's done much, much better.
3 ||| A letdown for me after Love Junk and One Sided Story. There's still some good material and some wry observations from Moe and crew, but the songwriting is a bit spottier and the sound is more arena based, and less inventive than in the past. I'd still buy it, no problem!
0 ||| Lonesome Dove was awesome, a wonderful movie. BUT this time it was like, veryone was, "poor pitiful me" not to mention the over acting on Sissy' part. Sorry I just felt that this series deserved a much better ending.
1 ||| Two years ago I bought one of these units. It worked great for one season. The next winter I followed the setup instructions and started up the unit. The unit heated up for about a minute then gave me the the dreaded two light error. The unit had died. I called Holmes and was told that the problem could not be fixed.Last winter I went out and bought another unit. It worked well throughout the winter season. At the end of the season I followed the cleaning / storage instructions and put it away.This morning I setup the humidifier and got the dreaded two light error again. One bad unit is a freak. Two units produced in different years is a more serious problem.Don't buy this unit if you want more than 1 year of use out of it.
1 ||| Although Shemin brings up many good ideas, I found that most of his ideas are way to cheezy for me (or Southern california.) He discusses buying places for $8,000-$20,000 (I wish) and believes that charging more for rent will ultimately get you higher quality tenents. I completely disagree, especially in down markets.A decent book, overall, but I'd suggest a Nolo book which has more real legal information as well as solid do's and don'ts for a landlord.
0 ||| This book is so loosely written, so disjointed, so poorly edited for both grammar and flow, with conversational lines that start nowhere and end in exactly the same place, one has to wonder if Cornwell owes the higher quality of her previous work to an outstanding editor.
0 ||| This was the worst piece of writing (if you can call it that) that I ever read. Of course, Ms. Weisberger is laughing all the way to the bank....Do NOT BUY THIS BOOK. See the movie this summer instead and save yourself money and time that can never be regained.
3 ||| A great toy for my dog, precisely because it DOESN'T squeak. It makes a honking noise (presumeably because it's a goose) which still gets my dog excited, but doesn't annoy me. Moderately durable. A dog that destroys other toys will do the same to this one.
4 ||| Very moving story on how to deal with what life deals to you. Although we all have different ways to handle tradegy, the author's story here is very moving. Highly recommend to all ages.
0 ||| I'M VERY UNHAPPY THE STUDIO EVEN AGREED TO MAKE THIS PIECE OF JUNK AFTER WINK OF AN EYE . HORRIBLE STORY! VERY BAD ACTING! THE TITLE WAS A JOKE. AN THE VIANS SHOULD NOT BE ALOUD BEHIND A CAMERA! GEM WAS A VEY LAUGHABLE NAME. IF THERE IS ONE 3 SEASON EPISODE THAT SHOULD BE WIPED OFF THE TREK TIMELINE, THIS IS THE ONE!
4 ||| It's great that the studio's is finally putting out a Matt Helm box set at a really great price compared to the more expensive separate versions.Any fan of 60's spy movies will love this set.Dean Martin's tongue is firmly in his cheek, and the women ,Tina Louise,Sharon Tate,Ann Margret,and many many more,what more can I say.Highly recommended!!
4 ||| The sight of this compact radio does not reveal the quality of the reception and the quality of the sound and it tunes digitally too. One would expect to pay a heap more. High quality, low price, convenient. The only other thing I would have liked would be memory presets, but for the price no complaint.
0 ||| DVD was Ok, but not very realistic. The classes take place in what looks like a church hall. Not a typical place to be interacting with your puppy. But I'm hopeful I will find something useful in it.
0 ||| I purchased one of the first panasonic dvr with the lifetime membership. When the HD went out and replaced, it was a expensive repair. The second one quit. My son replaced the HD and opening the unit found the HD encased with foam. Overheating????? yes! Programing soon became a problem. Panasonic support is terrible. I would never buy a panasonic product again.Had a comcast dvr, not a good product. Called Comcast regarding using TiVo with the cards that need to be installed and they said I had to upgrade my services. Called TIVO, you do not need to upgrade and they will do a 3way call with comcast when you set up your unit for the cards. MJS
2 ||| Okay Product good price worked with dvd, but did not work with ps3 xbox or other game system as advertised.
1 ||| I purchased Outlook 2007 because Microsoft has now chosen to exclude it from certain versions of Office 2007. Well, it has way less features than my previous Outlook:- no animated GIF's- no support for Outlook Personal Address Book (PAB)- the Outlook Text Editor has been eliminatedAnd now I find that if you purchase this `stand alone' version of Outlook 2007 the `Themes and Stationary' feature is disabled. It only works in those versions of Outlook 2007 that are bundled with the Office Suite, not this version!This is NOT AN UPGRADE, it's a DOWNGRADE!
0 ||| Simply put, this album is really bad. Bowie should be embarrased at releasing such a piece of trash. There might be 2 OK tracks, but that's it. The lyrics are depressing, the music is boring, and Bowie's voice sounds as if it's been electronically slowed down and drawn out. This will be the second Bowie album I trade-in as used. And it will be the last Bowie album I buy without first paying more attention to the critics and others.
1 ||| Yes, this is a new kind of sports toy for the kids to ride. Great for using your body and balance. Was ok for the first 2 weeks, then we noticed that the back wheel especially, was flaking away and chunks were falling off of it. Made for a very bumpy ride. Tried to replace the wheels by ordering new ones, but do to command for them they are back ordered? Not really sure, when we are to receive them. So it worked for the first 2 weeks and now it sits. Didn't think it was too expensive at the time of purchase, but for something that can't be used, I wouldn't have paid what we did for it and have it fall apart so soon.
0 ||| This series of videos is scary for young children. Do not let the G rating fool you. I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes. Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos. Not something I want my child learning. Very poorly done story lines. Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!
1 ||| The two stars given are only because I love Charlie Chaplin. As for this collection, most of the pictures are in bad condition and the heads are cut off of the majority of Charlie's earlier classics. It makes it very frustrating to watch. I would pay a bit more and go for a company that cares, not one that just wants a quick buck!
1 ||| If you are looking for something that is period, or anything even close to serious drama. This movie offers nothing for you. I find it a rather indignant thing to open the the first scene with Queen's We Will Rock You, (being a fan of Queen). The movie has a dull plot. The best lines are delivered by secondary characters only. Chaucer is a riot, and is the whole reason to even give a passing glance at this one. The jousting scenes are ...[bad], and somehow, althought not surprisingly all the same.
4 ||| Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was an awesome book. It was so awesome because it was so visual. What I mean by this is that all through the book, even though the characters in the novel were not able to describe him, it was written in a way that I was able to picture Hyde's face. I could just see his ugly face.Also, the idea of someone who is able to change themselves completey by just drinking a potion is an awesome concept(although the change was not what Dr. Jekyll wanted). I also enjoy the fact that the main character kills himself in the end. That doesn't happen in most stoies and it gave this story a great twist.I wouldn't change a thing about this book and would reccommend to any reader Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
4 ||| There have been other takeoffs of this theme in later days but noone makes this so real and believable as the two stars. Margaret sullavan's throaty voice captivates and holds your attention at all times.
4 ||| A great example of a film that was able to combine a weird dramatic tension with a crazy emotional tension: laughter/crying at the same time. Crazy dialogue and situations that logically shouldn't work, but do in the most amazing way. The best American film since David Lynch's Mulholland Dr.
0 ||| After reading the book and having the pleasure of meeting the authors in Missouri, all I can say...nothing new here. If you consider ripping off existing fly patterns revolutionary...go ahead, buy the book. Buy some Tony Accardo flies and poppers and take your hat off to a true master.
4 ||| One heck of a film. This was the first ELM STREET film I saw and I really got into the series after this. This fantasy horror is so much better than any FRIDAY 13TH because its original, and has a plot. The ending to this is one of the best/ clever endings to a horror film and Freddy moves to different heights of evil (ie: turns into a snake, puppet, nurse and he wears a tuxedo.)Simply brilliant, horror fans miss this at your peril!
3 ||| I enjoyed the continuation of the characters developed in the previous novels. The seeming loss of vigor and joy of life is very realistic since the loss is the result of slaying so many demons. Kay's determination and doubts are at odds in a very human way.If the novel reflects a declining joy on the part of the author to resurrect the characters for each new novel, I guess I can respect that and applaud her efforts. I know I have read and enjoyed all of her novels(Hornets Nest the least).
0 ||| This gizmo is a costly dud. The first set of test strips let me use it successfully twice. The machine insisted the rest of the strips had passed the expiration date. They had not. Then the last strip worked. I must have made a mistake, I thought, so I stupidly bought another $25 box of test strips. Now, the machine simply rejects the lot number which you must dial in. It will not accept even one of the new test strips. I emailed the company's "customer service" department. They eventually gave me a refund for the second box of strips.Do not even think about buying this thing.
4 ||| When STP put out Core many years ago I was interested and bought the album. Now that is a hard album for me to listen to. With Shangri-La Dee Da STP has continued the right path to glam rock. There are some jems on this album that will stick in your head for a while after listening to them. "Days of the Week" cools it down a bit after the hard opening track "Dumb Love." I was singing along with the chorus of "Days of the Week" on my second time through and it is still in the back of my mind a week later. The other great song I recommend on this album is "Too Cool Queenie." I have liked STP from day one and Shangri-La Dee Da just shows they keep getting better and better.
0 ||| I triedTo watch this movie six or seven times. It would not stream for me. I worked with amazon to resolve this problem, it did not work. I cancelled amazon prime.
1 ||| It certainly isn't about firefighting. It's more about man's inhumanity to animals and the careless ways in which we treat them. If you care anything about animals this book will break your heart.
3 ||| I enjoyed Bad Boys II. I watch movies for entertainment & comedies especially to laugh...& I did. I'm a fan of both Will Smith & Martin Lawrence & I'll watch most anything they're in. This movie was "sexier" than the first one [the guys looked hot!] & it surely has lots of male fantasy....things blowing up & shooting everywhere. That got a little old for me, but Smith & Lawerence kept me entertained with their chemistry. I bought the DVD & was disappointed not to find the director commentary. They do give some behind the scenes footage [like MTV making the video] but it's not the same. I love to hear the director talk about the particulars of a scene as I'm watching...it makes for great discussion. I probably wouldn't have purchased the DVD had I known there wasn't any director commentary like the first one. It's still an entertaining movie, but not as much as I hoped.
0 ||| Roochnik's 20 years of study has revealed a clear but shallow book on Plato; he forges his "techne" glasses on everything he touches leaving the reader with no clear understanding of what Socratic wisdom consists of. His Plato becomes boring and uninsightful. Readers should skip this book and go directly to Strauss or Bloom for a clear and meaningful understanding of PLatonic wisdom.
3 ||| this was an excellent piece. the material and the look were calssic and my wife loved it, which is ofcourse a bonus cuz i want to see it more. i would definitely suggest it.
4 ||| the facts of life tv series follows 4 teenage girls blair,natalie,jo,and tootie in the eastland school for girls and believe me theres always something going on.
0 ||| This is X-rated for pre-teens and high school girls. I got in so much trouble for sneaking it from my friend to read. Now, I am grounded for the summer.Thank you to the stupid author who made the cover look like this book was ok for someone my age to read.
3 ||| Darkness, evil, and corruption...thats what you'll get when you watch this movie. But for all the turmoil in Gotham, there is one beacon of hope, though this beacon is quite dark himself. Bruce Wayne, played by the talented Christian Bale, is Batman, a hero for the people w/ his own set of problems...dating back to his parents murder when he was just a boy. Throughout the movie he tries to deal with these issues while saving Gotham from "the bad guy."The special effects in this movie are incredible. Plus the batmobile just kicks a**. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for some dark, moody entertainment.
1 ||| I liked this movie when I saw it in the theater, but... this isn't the movie I saw in the theater. Hey, if a director wants to get his or her jollies by recutting a movie, go for it, but at least make sure the original theatrical version is available. I've seen this movie many times, but the additional mish-mash of scenes on the bloated director's cut detract from the drama and tension of the original. Historical inaccuracies aside, this was a thought-provoking movie when it was released; Now, in it's current incarnation, it only provokes. When I see the director's cut, I am taken out of the movie with thoughts of how much better it used to be.
3 ||| detail description and instructions on how to use tai chi and the reason and uses for the program. So far it has been very helpful.
4 ||| Im ussualy into something much more brutal & insane & gore then the likes of hatebreed but i can't deny tha fact that i enjoy their music alot! I seen this guys at ozzfest & i did enjoy their performance alot & i just like how their music attracts all kinds of people...Some how that makes me like them even more! I quess that's hatebreed for you! Okay, hatebreed's new album "rise of brutaly" as well as the one before that "perseverance" are also pretty amazing in itslef...Support hatebreed!PS: I hate the fact that they put slipknot in the same category as hatebreed...F*ck slipknot--they suckkk!!!!!!! Only posers listing to slipknot,f*ck 'em!
1 ||| If you like the original. You may be disapointed. I was. I wanted to see a real continuation. What I got was meany hard to follow snips. I think the director could not get them all in one place again. So, they wrote small movies for each.
4 ||| I loved this blast from the past. Nicholas Cage is great in this movie and I watched it twice in a row. Great for something to do.
0 ||| I was forced to read this book in reading class. I found it to be a long book about nothing. Half of the time the book talked the old man's wandering thoughts which had almost nothing to do with the story. And my teacher told us that every thing that happened to Santiago was related to Jesus's crusifiction. I could see that in some areas, but in others it seemed far feched.
0 ||| If you enjoy being deceived then you will like this book. The existence of Mary Ann Collins is questionable. No one that I can find has ever seen or met her. She refuses to give it any information about what convent she allegedly joined. I am a former fundamentalist preacher who is now a Catholic priest. I found freedom from fundamentalism in the "pillar and foundation of truth" that is the Catholic Church. You can too, see [...] the Catholic Answers page.
2 ||| The musicianship is outstanding. The recording quality demonstrates how excellent a CD can sound. That says a lot with over-produced, highly-compressed CDs being the current norm. Unfortunately the quality of the album ends there. Nils Lofgren does not have a good voice and he should definitely leave the high notes alone. But the worst part of the album is the inane and banal lyrics. It would be kind to call the writing sophomoric since the lyrics are more kindergarten quality and repetitious. It appears that since the songwriter had little to say they felt compelled to say it multiple times.A five star album should have no flaws and this album unfortunately has two very critical flaws that are difficult to ignore---voice and lyrics. Leo Kotke released a CD called "One Guitar, No Vocals". Hopefully Nils Lofgren will do the same someday.
3 ||| These tweeters were a replacement for a set of vifa tweeters that i had. I needed a replacement for the vifas due to size constraints, the vifas while they sound great were 2 1/2 inches and would not fit in the window sill were the side view mirrors are mounted, but these little BOSS TW-15 tweeeters were perfect and they swivel for better staging and direction of highs. They sound good, maybe not as good as the vifas which cost three times as much, but with a wider range of placement applications due to its size (1 1/2 inches) and it's ability to swivel although minimal one can direct the highs, and the highs are more directional sensetive then say the a midrange or a subwoofer. In general its sound quality is good, mounting options are great and price per performance can't be beat
1 ||| Je suis un peu déu par cet album... c'est morne, le son est pas top... a trane dans les longueurs... bref ennuyeux! mais bon il faut se mettre à l'époque aussi! a à qd mme 13 ans!
1 ||| If you enjoyed the rest of the series, stop and don't read this book. Yes, you will be left wondering what happens to the rest of the swords, who is the Emperor, what happens to Mark and the rest, but live with the curiosity. This book goes beyond anticlimactic, it is just awful. The ending and the explanation of the Emperor is so...I can't even find words for how disappointing it is.I'm left wondering if Saberhagen didn't outgrow the series and quickly wrote Shieldbreaker's story to bring the series to a close so he could move on to other endeavors. I can not believe that he actually thought that this ending would satisfy his readers.I can not stress enough how thoroughly disappointing and frustrating the ending of this book is. Saberhagen should personally apologize to everyone who read this book
4 ||| At long last American fans of Godzilla can affordably enjoy what many rate as their favorite Godzilla feature. This Sony/Toho Master Series release brings us both the classic AIP dubbed American release print titled Godzilla VS The Thing, and the original Japanese version Mosura Tai Gojira with english subtitles, for those who prefer authenticity. There are great extras including interviews and audio commentary by American Godzilla experts. It's priced irresistably at less than $20! I didn't wait on this one, and will always cherish it.
1 ||| When I read this book I was very disappointed. It is just about a SWAT team that goes around Europe shooting bad guys. Big deal. Even worse, the plot (which I won't reveal here) isn't as chillingly plausible as those in Clancy's earlier works. It's not believable, it's just dumb. This book falls far below Clancy's usually high standards. It propably makes a better computer game than a book. You'll want to read it if you are a Clancy fan, but if not, read one of his earlier, and much better works.
1 ||| Is cheap and does its jobBut the handle feel cheap and seems like is about to break.Sometime the peper chop a big chunk off
3 ||| Radiosity and Global Illumination has been written by two real experts in the field of advanced computer graphics. The main focus of this book is a very readable introduction to the radiosity-method but the authors also cover most of the more advanced techniques. The book could dig a little deeper into the underlying mathematics though.
0 ||| First the pros:It's heavy enough with the suction feet to prevent the slicer moving around the counter.Simple to operate.Now the cons:The blade is so close to the metal surround it actually touches it and dulls the blade. I was not able to adjust this even by loosening the center screw and trying to move the blade.To clean the blade means getting a screwdriver of the right size to undo the blade assembly - I would have thought that a metal 'key' would have made this easier.The inner washers and belt assembly fall out very easily, so be careful not to lose them.The cutting is pretty slow even for home use.The inner gears are plastic - not sure how long this thing would last.The size is really only meant for small cheeses, fruits, and meat, if you wanted to slice a bigger piece of meat, you are out of luck as the sliding holder does not move to the left far enough to do this.Overall, poorly designed and poorly made, am returning for a refund.
1 ||| I normally do not write reviews for items, but, I was so dissatisfied with this product that I felt I should warn others of the quality. I purchased a package of 100 screws, and I am glad that I had plenty extra. I ended up throwing away 1 of every 4 screws. I discovered 2 problems with the screws. The first is that the threads are bad on some of the screws and would not thread into the #8/32 bolts I have. I know it was the screw because another brand I purchased (shorter length) always threaded with no problems. Also for a good screw in this batch they also threaded with no problems. The second problem is that the hex head is not a consistent size. some heads would not accept the hex key in them, being to small, others fit just fine.Good price, but consistent quality is definitely an issue.
1 ||| First the film it's self. It just had too much to live up to. I always laugh a lot watching the first film. All involved were in top form. And were working from a great script. Grins are about all I get here. Everyone tries but the script is WEAK. Ms. Taylor was so beautiful that I enjoyed just watching her and Mr. Tracy was one of the VERY BEST there has ever been. But just that won't make up for the thin script. Now the DVD transfer. The color is so bad everything looks pastel when any color other than green can be decerned. I watched this on a home theatre system and the sound was nothing special but alright. On a regular t.v. it would be pretty sub-par.
2 ||| I liked it when Finnegan woke up. There was also the part when James Joyce wrote the second chapter - that was good too. Not as good as Dubliners though.
4 ||| Excellent karaoke CD. We love it and the music of Abba just makes us happy! Recommend highly - nice collection of songs.
0 ||| I ordered the animated Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie from Amazon.com for $9.95 and got it today..... Only it had a bright green Walgreens sale sticker that says 2/$5 !!!!!! WTF?!!Hmmmmmm.............. AWESOME. Called customer service, and "the best they could do" was issue a refund of $5.95 (which isn't as good as Walgreens offers, but oh well. LOL But I thought I would let you guys know... so take from it what you want;) LOLOtherwise, its a good movie and I would rate it higher.. but I wanted to have a low score to bring attention to others about my experience;)
4 ||| This movie is brilliant. It has both amazing imagery and a classic storyline. It's hard not to like this movie because of those two factors. After seeing this flick, you just fall in love with.
1 ||| I purchased this product 3 weeks ago. I purchased this because the ball is soft and doesn't hurt the little guys.I have 4 children that LOVE the game however after use the ball started to rip. It is now ripped from the pole and I have been unable to locate a replacement.
2 ||| Even though there aren't many words to read and the book is a little busy with so much going on in pictures, my 15 month old still loves Elmo. She loves books. This isn't her favorite book, but it's okay for a quick look.
3 ||| I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR ONE SONG BUT ALSO LIKE MOST OF THE SONGS ON IT. USED BUT IN GOOD SHAPE.
1 ||| Came back to alert potential buyers to serious flaws in this latest Clancy work, but it looks like most of it has already been covered. Seems like Clancy was rushing to meet a deadline and didn't give his editors a chance. Plot lines that go nowhere. Characters (the few new ones) that never get developed. Most importantly, about 400 pages too long (take them out of the first 600). Obviously no one had time to proofread as the book is literally rife with typos, misspells, and tourtured constructions.If you are a Clancy fan like me, you'll buy it and read it anyway, but I hope enought people don't that he gets his act back together for the next one.
3 ||| I thought that April MOrning was a great book. It was very interesting and i learned a lot about the towns people from Lexington. All the textbooks that I have ever read only talk about who one the battle and what famous people faught in it. After i read April Morning i had a new respect for the people of Lexington, they had their families taken away form them and their towns destroyed all because the British wanted gun powder. I also think that Howard Fast did a great job in relating the present to the past. I think that it schould be part of the Social Studies curriculum.
1 ||| I loved the first season. I enjoyed the second season even as it added more and more GL agenda items. The third season crossed over for me from being a fresh fun & energetic showcase of talent to an every-episode attempt to promote the GL agenda. Too bad...
2 ||| Even though I detest rap music (unoriginal, copies everyone else's music, totally inane and stupid) at least Lauryn Hill uses her own medleys and lyrics without having to steal from others.
4 ||| This terrific set of "Sophia Siren Songs" is a unique tribute to her, and a surprising cornucopia of offerings. The music is a mixed bag, but none of the selections are without interest, and some are quite extraordinary - as sonically sound as anything Marilyn Monroe or Bardot ever recorded, if you're into sexpot pop. This is an expensive set, but it's well worth the price for the sumptuous hardcover book accompanying the 2 CDs. There are over 300 pages of photos and color poster art from all her films. Also included is a DVD with varying quality, mostly European, trailers from all her films - a very nice addition. What you get is a fine quality collector's item - a wonderful souvenir for Sophia fans. For me, she's the screen's supreme sexpot - and one of it's finest actors, too!
1 ||| My favorite thing about this "Vonnegut's greatest hits" attempt is that he didn't actually write it; rather, it is an attempt by network television to capitalize on the successful moments of his books and short stories. Well, it doesn't work. The "Plot device" is so weak it walks on thin ice-nine; an astronaut trapped in a time warp that throws him into the best moments of Vonnegut's books? Why not give them proper films of their own? And most importantly, how about giving the true authors the blame where it is due? The original idea's are Vonneguts, but this plundering is not. A capitalist bankruptcy
3 ||| Living in the area that McMurtry hails from and writes about in the Duane Moore trilogy has made me a bit biased in regards to this series. I never-the-less found each of the books in this series to be entertaining and well written. This last book has given a fitting end to characters that we have come to love and feel for. The characters each have traits that many of us can relate too. Duanes depression and Karla's attempts to understand and the reaction of the children and grandchildren all combine to make this a wonderful story. And even if you don't find it to be a story that you would want to reread in the future, it will definately make you realize that no matter how hard to live with your own kids are, that they are not so bad compared with Duane and Karla's kids and grandkids.
0 ||| I found the author to be self-serving in his writing. Nobody REALLY wants to hear about his boozing and depression. What little advice he offers is common sense for which you need not buy this book.
3 ||| The Giver was moving, beautiful, and deep. The world reminded me a lot of Matched by Ally Condie. I'm glad I read it as an adult. It might have gone over my head if I'd read it in middle school. It was pretty deep and serious stuff. I'm still thinking about it. To be honest, I'm trying to figure out what happened at the end. It had a very high-brow literary feel to it, but it wasn't hard to read. Good literature has three things: first, excellent writing, second, lots and lots of feelings, and third, a nice, ambiguous ending. The Giver has all of this and more. As ambiguous as the ending was, it was still beautiful and I walked away from the book having a better appreciation for life in general.
3 ||| Freddy's 3rd is better than the 2nd, because he is in it more, and Nancy is back! Nancy helps teens with their nightmares at Westin Hills. Kristen has the power to bring people into her dreams. She gets help from Nancy, Joey, Kincaid, and others. Dr. Neil Gordon tries to help by burrying Freddy in holy ground and splashing his bones with holy water. This one hints about how Freddy came to be. (You find out more about that in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child') This is also kind of sad because Nancy dies toward the end. If you love the Freddy series, hopefully, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS!!!
0 ||| I am glad that this was not the first Jody Picoult book that I have read - not sure I would have continued with her others...I have loved most of her other books that I have read. However, I felt that Keeping Faith left too many unanswered questions which made the events in the book unbelievable. The ending was very disappointing - it did not bring anything to closure, nor did it lead you to make any of your own conclusions.Sorry to say that this book was a let-down for me.
1 ||| Have tried the more expensive product from North American and it cleared up mine and my husband's stuffy noses within 24 hrs. Occasionally you would get a slight after burp with that product. With this product, I've been taking for a week and I still have a stuffy nose and never an after burp. Plus the capsules are huge compared to p73.
3 ||| Look, I bought this in Jul/07 for about seventyish and I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase. True, it's not gonna stand up to Analon, Caphalon pro and the like. But for sub $100 you can't go wrong if you take care of it. Analon is prettier and more durable - the handles on this leave a little to be desired compared with my caphalon pro pans. OVerall very satisfied, good bang for the buck.
2 ||| The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written, because it has real personalities as real people. For example, when people are in a group they change to fit in, just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was "less than perfect" because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things, like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair.
0 ||| I love time trax, and I love collecting movies, the only problem that I have is when I pay a premium price for an item that is supposed to be brand new, but it turns out to be a dv case full of used and scratched/scuffed discs that have obviously seen their way around the break room or wherever some employee decided to watch it. I only come to that conclusion because the item is not from a private seller. It is suppose to be factory direct via amazon. Very disappointing. I begrudgingly will not send it back as I have been waiting a long time for these to be available and I am sure with all o the problems this item has had it probably won't be around very much longer, if you don't care about condition than go for it.
2 ||| The movies itself is great, the quality of the DVD is not, it skips in some spots and was supposed to be brand new??
4 ||| I was really debating rather or not to buy this movie cause I thought it be corny. I did buy it and watched it 4 times already. It a great movie! Lots of ups and downs. Having you cheer for the underdog and screaming at the Tv. I really liked this movie!
1 ||| I thought it would be an awesome surprise for my friend's birthday, but it turned out to be a disappointment. This video tries to turn 'power hour' to 'boring geek hour'. Oh well.
1 ||| I actually went to see this movie in the theaters and I was severly disappointed. It's not that the acting is bad, but the movie as a whole is lacking. The main thing that kills it is the pacing. It is REALLY, REALLY slow - almost painfully so because after sitting through it, you really want an ending that at least makes it worth all your suffering . . . and it never comes. Very bad movie. I strongly suggest passing this one over.
0 ||| The concert is good but not the video resolution and it skips back and it cycles back at a certain part of the videoo - it never ends.I don't recommend buying this dvd.I am very disappointed, a waste of money.
3 ||| As with other contemporary horror scribes, Hautala plays down a lot of the supernatural and monster aspects of his tales, instead concentrating on the human elements. Here we have a recently reformed family faced with tragedy both in its past and present. An enthralling and creepy read that, like other Hautala tales, backs an emotional punch.
3 ||| easily installed, wonderful product, can't believe it took us this long to spend less than $20 to upgrade our showering experience.
3 ||| Haven't finished. First part is a autobiography, second part is a synthesis and Shulgin's reactions to the chemicals he experimented with. Larger than you'd expect, but thats cause its basically 2 books in one.
1 ||| Well, I've read some other Alan Moore's graphic novels, such as V, Watchmen and The killing joke. I thought those were fantastic, very creative pieces of art.Then I read that the Courtyard will be finally available and that it's probably the best he has done, very intricate plot, blablablah and what do you know? my hopes went sky high.What I got was a short story, macabre, dense, nicely delivered, but that was pretty much it. The plot is very straight forward, it didn't impact me as much as I thought.Maybe I didn't get it, maybe I'm still expecting this to be a serie, with subsequent installments, maybe I need to be more Moore to understand the deepness.Right now I think it was a very expensive item for what I got.
2 ||| Not worth the price!! The M3's do just as good and are a safe and reliable shave. Getting to be a rip off!!
2 ||| ...when you're forced to read something this boring, it doesn't tend to sit well. The simple plot followed by confusing images, muffled transition, and the fact my Senior English teacher thought this was a very good book, well... I wasn't too happy with it. What did appeal to me was the imagery and the character of Tess, who was presented very nicely. (Hence the extra stars <wink>) Sorry if offended anyone.BTC
4 ||| It's nice have this great little known made for TV movie on DVD!!! Okay,the picture and sound quality is not the greatest in the world,but this film is quite a rare find,so thats fine!!! It's a early Burt Reynolds performance and there's fine acting from James Best,Don Dubbins and Inger Stevens also!!! A obscure 70's gem!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
4 ||| When I started reading The Mitford Years #1, I couldn't put it down until I finished book #8. The story keeps you glued and you feel you know and love Father Tim and his wife personally. I was happy to find that there was a book #9 which brought the whole series to a close. You have to start at the beginning, but it's well worth the read.
3 ||| The third book of James Alexander Thom that I have read this year. They were all great. Lot of history that was great to read about. A book you can't wait to get done, but don't want it to end.
2 ||| Even though there are so many Christmas-oriented movies, this one and its sequal have always put me in the Christmas spirit... I used to love it more when I was younger, though. Now a days I'd say that the whole beating people up for fun isn't so entertaining.
2 ||| Had to give up after about 300 pages. Admired how she developed the characters but the story moved along way too slowly so that I often fell asleep while reading it. At least the numerous run-on sentences provided some amusement. May try another novel by George Elliot if I can find a shorter one. Most of the books I read are quite lengthy but I finish them because they are engrossing stories written with a comprehensible sentence structure.
4 ||| This is THE MOST mysterious and the most charming music that one might find the Sufi Filed.
3 ||| As an Australian not well versed in American history, a lot of the later chapters involving war were lost on me. However Benjamin Franklin is an extremely inspiring person and his list of virtues have found a place in how I want to organize my life and my future.
4 ||| To date, this is the best Matman movie yet. I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive since the Batman movies of the past seemed plain out cheesy, however, Batman Begins proved to be the exact opposite or it's predecessors. Starring Christian Bale, Batman Begins is more "true-to-life" than the one's of the past and emits a dark, goth, atmosphere. More Underworld-like (the movie). You have to see this for yourself.
1 ||| I really didn't learn why this company failed or even exactly what they were trying to sell, but with over five scenes of him working out in the gym, I sure got to know how really buff Kaleil is. Excellent!
2 ||| if this book were half of it's 420 pages, it would've been an excellent read. overall, i think the book is a great study of America in mid-century and especially of gay culture at that time. Anecdotes and quotes are repeated frequently in the book which gave me a sense of deja-vu as I was reading it.
3 ||| First of all, I like most things militaristic. This movie is sort of inspiring to the military types; with Kurt Russells utter lack of visible emotion and stringent discipline. Perfect! It is what every truelly dedicated soldier/sailor/sniper/grunt would LOVE to achieve. The only thing that I feel keeps the film from being in the five star catagory is just a couple of things. I would have liked to see more of the childhood. Maybe a touch of inner dialog from Todd. And then towards the end...wish I could know what happened to the colonists and the soldiers. Wanting to know these little details is what promoted my interest in the film to the point that I wondered if the movie was based on a Sci-fi book of some kind. If anyone is aware of a written version of this film I would certainly like to know.
3 ||| This is a wonderful collaboration of two of my favorite folkies. I especially enjoy their renditions of Ferron's "Ain't Life a Brook" and the traditional "He Was a Friend of Mine". "Fishin With Bill" just makes me smile.
3 ||| I love this stuff...it cleans percolators and makes them look like the day they came out of the box. The only problem is that the stuff is clumped and hard when I receive it, and I have to take a knife to it to separate the powder crystals, which can get really messy...
2 ||| A typical book in this series, with Jane and Shelley occupying their time by solving a mystery.However, while there were a lot of suspects, the ending came way too quickly, in about two paragraphs. And the confrontation only lasted about two sentences.Definitely not the best in this usually entertaining series.
4 ||| An inspired and authentic Science Fiction movie. Trust me, if you don't like it, then you haven't managed to grasp even the most basic subtlety of the film - perhaps you should try something a bit less intelligent like Star Wars.
3 ||| Living in Little Rock, and being familiar with the underlying story, I have to admit that the author's depiction of both is (no pun intended) dead-on. Moreover, it adds depth to a chilling story. You come away from the read with a better understanding of Ms. Orsini--for better or for worse.
1 ||| Reading some of the other reviews of this book, I see that I'm not alone in thinking this while it makes for great sci fi/action movie material, it's not a particularly enjoyable read. I've read most of Ridley's work and as far as the character Soledad goes, she's a typical Ridley protagonist.When describing his books to someone who hadn't read him, I foudn myself saying "you don't read him expecting everything to be all good in the end." His lead characters are almost never worthwhile as human beings, but the difference in this book is that it's actually easier to identify and sypathize with the primary antagonist, Vaughn. There's more logic behind his murderous actions than there is behind Soledad's.Like some other's have already said: it could be that Ridley is making a statement about bigotry and how it can infect anyone's mind. I just don't feel that Soledad is a character worthy of more than one book.
0 ||| This would be a more useful book had the author done a little fact checking. Many of the events described from the investigation to the criminal and civil trials are incorrectly reported or, in fact, never occured. One of the most telling incidents, mysteriously omitted from this author's account, involves the public rebuke by the trial judge of a PR Rep. for having entered the well of the courtroom during a recess and gotten caught going through exhibits and evidence. Save your money unless you are only interested in a conjured perception which is in conflict with reality.
3 ||| This bike trainer is well made and has proved very worthwhile attached to my older mountain bike. When the instruction manual states that a knobby tire is not recommended it is not kidding. I didn't have a smooth tire initially and the noise and vibration was horrible. Using a cheap smooth tire made a huge difference and now the trainer is nice and quiet. I take off 1 star because of the bar-mounted resistance adjustment lever. I could not get it to work; the instructions were useless. The gears on the bike provide all the resistance variance I need so the extra lever was a waste of money. Get the model without the remote lever and save about $10.
0 ||| This is the worst film i've seen in a long, long, long time. As i was sitting through this so called movie waitig for the credits to start, i found myself in mindnumbing agony. So i will not go in to the details of how stupid and just plain unfunny "Chasing Papi" actually is, because it would be just to painful (I'm not kidding).I urge anybody who is considering to rent or even buy this "movie" not to do so. There are plenty of other stupit comedies out there that don't make you whant to blow your brains out.
3 ||| This is a brilliant book. It is very well laid out. The ideas in the book are so very relevant to our times. The argumentation is very well presented, and very logical indeed. The positions that Jared takes in this book are positions not to be taken lightly. The lessons from the societies that have collapsed are so very relevant to our times.Yet, the one thing that was missing for me, is the effect of the sudden increase of our global population in the last 150 years, on the stresses that the world's environment must face today. The pressure on the world's resources is so dramatically different from the pressures of all the centuries ago. I am sure that with the seeming decrease in western populations, global migrations etc, the ways in which we will regard the problems of today, be different from the world of 200 years ago.All in all, a highly recommended book. It is a book to be read slowly, with care. The lessons are to be absorbed, not forgotten when the book is put down.
4 ||| The book was delivered in perfect condition and vey quickly. Having read the book I would totally recommend it. Informative, complete but maybe not ideal for a newbie.
2 ||| Like some others, I bought these on clearance for $8.99. For around $27 I got 3 sets, the Caramel, Light Green, and Lavendar. The green and lavendar look like easter egg colors, otherwise they are nice enough. The caramel is a nice color! We like these sheets, we have a really high pillow top mattress and they don't quite fit but we still use them tightly stretched. They are not deluxe! They are usable, just not the nicest quality sheets you'll ever own. What do you expect for $8.99? At this price I feel like I got a deal, but not sure if I would pay much more for them.
2 ||| I have to no commend this movie. but this movie was mediocre movie. Good thing I rented this movie and watched it. I didn't enjoy it at all.
3 ||| Not a true review but I cannot resist. Although not perfect, for many years this was my favorite Heinlein novel. I have, however, finally read it too many times. Even after all these years I know what is going to happen next from page to page to such an extent that I am unable to finish the book for the first time ever. Prime Heinlein though.
2 ||| I enjoyed this movie it had some funny gags and jokes but some of the gags and jokes worked and some didn't and it isn't as funny as Airplane or Naked Gun but I really like Charlie Sheen he was very good in this movie. I would recommend that people rent this first before deciding if they want to buy it unless they have already seen it and really like it enough to add to their collection.
4 ||| It sounds right, is the best way to say this. Sometimes an album just clicks, tracks in order, everything moving smoothly together. Such is the sound of VERSION 2.0, a big, liquid album with a song for every mood. Here is a group that enjoys playing together -- see them in concert; they have a good time -- and they spend the album playing with us, doing bleak, doing frantic, doing downright catty. Showing off? They have a right to. This is very good stuff.
2 ||| It's a very simple product, so there isn't much to say. It's a weighted vest so that you can burn more calories and build up muscle while doing regular activities or going for a walk. There isn't a lot of room for error or excellence--it's a weight vest, and it works, thanks to gravity and biomechanics. There is one small problem: it's a black, nylon vest of pockets filled with orange packets--every time I go outside, I worry that people are going to think I'm wearing a suicide bomb vest.
3 ||| it has very little give in the arch. It cannot be bent like the picture, and would likely snap with that much pinch (or that forceful of a tug on your pendant). Otherwise, it looks nice.
3 ||| This book was so close to being the best horror novel ever written. It just lacked a couple of things. The most important being a good description of what the monster looked like, granted it was fun to make up the image yourself. One of the reasons why I personally think it is a bit on the short side and does lack some description is that it was written for a friendly writing contest by Mary Shelly, her husband and some friends. However anyone who considers themselves well read even if they are not a fan of horror should read this book. It is very good and at only just over 200 pgs (most editions) it is not a time consuming book.
4 ||| This not only happens to be my favorite Tom Wolfe book, but my favorite book period. The plot is exciting and realistic. Readers will relate with every single character depicted here. And no one matches Wolfe's descriptive capabilities. What the rest of us would need a million words to say, Wolfe manages to express with a few key and very visual phrases. So far, there isn't a book I've enjoyed more.
1 ||| While I could get the lift I needed by adding water, the water itself made the pillow feel cold. I tried wrapping it in a double layer of fleece and then my pillowcase but after one night my neck and shoulders hurt so bad from the cool water that I just gave up. Reminded me of the time my waterbed heater gave out. Even a heavy quilt on top didn't protect me from the coolness. I was definitely not happy with this product and would not recommend it.
0 ||| Watchout for any braindead friend you have that will never stop telling you that this is the 'greatest' comedy of all time. In actuality it's pretty lame. I could have very well lived a full and happy life without seeing this movie that takes it so-so jokes and tries to ram them down your throat. It's got a few chuckles, but for the most part you just wait patiently for it to end.
2 ||| I'll start with the positive: the set design for this movie is still fascinating, years later. Some of the street level plaster work looks kind of unlikey, as do a couple of the painted panoramas. But it's still quite stunning to look at. That's really where the movie sticks with you.But otherwise, it's very weakly put together. The acting is fine, but the dialogue is paced and unnatural and cheesy. And the editing in this director's cut, like the original cut, is very sloppy in places -- for example there's a scene that's supposed to represent hours of interviews, which messes up the time passage device. There's an editing mistake like this every two or three minutes, with bad continuity, and it's really irritating. It's like reading someone's bad spelling & grammar, and weak story-telling, with extraordinary penmanship. And its relationship to Philip K. Dick is tepid. Rent this one ... you won't watch it more than once.
1 ||| I was pleased with the service of the company, but the seat cover is NOT worth $80. It was a little too short for my Tahoe, even though I got the XL. I do like the fact it covers part of the floor and for the most part stays in place. I have 3 large dogs (lab, german shepard, and a great dane), and with all 3 of them in the back seat, the seat cover did not move. I just think the price they charge for these things is way too much and I think this works just as well as other seat covers out there that cost a lot less
1 ||| I just purchased this thing one week ago. I tried a dvd given to me by a friend. The dvd kept freezing up. I thought it was the dvd. When I tried 2 brand new out of the box dvd's. They both were freezing up. This is not the dvd player for me. Maybe this is a bad unit, I just do not know. I think I will look for something else.
4 ||| This is a really GREAT book. Lot of pictures - I like that. This book could be enjoyed by anyone I think. It sits on my coffee table and it works really good - people come to my house - see it - pick it up - and then I don't have to talk to them for about 30 minutes.
4 ||| All the haters are just a bunch of weirdo computer geeks who complain about software, but could never write anything better themselves. They should focus on getting a date and leave Microsoft alone. This is a well thought out product and you should be happy that you purchased it. I sure am!
4 ||| This is a great book, whether you are a novice Titanic buff, or really into it, this is a must read for ALL Titanic freaks. I read this long ago, before TITANIC came out in the theaters. When you read this, go see the movie again, a lot of some things that appear in this book as fact are also in the movie, which made it more heart wrenching and REAL. Also, see the movie by the same name, based on this book. It is also great.
4 ||| This is really is a great book that fills the gap that one might need to start meditating. Wish I found this book years ago when I started.
4 ||| I recently heard this when I was 13 or 14 at the time when this came out. I was in a band one time in middle school where I play the trumpet. Even now I still play it to this day, I know that I'm a huge fan to jazz. Yeah my man Tom Scott is real kickin' on this one. He sounds foremost like my man whom I call my favorite to date is Mr. Richard Elliott.This is sure is killin'. I look forward of buying when I get me a job and make me some money. Big up to Tom Scott 4 putting out much work.
0 ||| Julia was right to hate the use of her name by others, Julie Powell is the exact opposite of what Julia was.
2 ||| Typical british humour taking the mickey out of the moment, BUT considering all the hype about how funny this film was supposed to be you will be highly disappointed, watchable alot of the funny scenes are predictable or not even funny - delivery of the wrong body/coffin, the accidently taking the drugs and having the side effects, finding your father was secretly having an affair with another man who happens to be a dwarf. Again watchable but not very funny and certainly not in the class of Four Weddings and a funeral or Bridget Jones Diary.
2 ||| Undoubtedly a great story this was. Stevenson couldn't have done a better job in telling the story of these two individuals trapped in the body of one. The concept is of an awesome nature, and so is the story.Now, many people that have never read this think it to be a horror tale. This is indeed true - some of this story is horror. But more than a horror tale, this is a psychological mystery. The way it begins, the way many of the mysteries unfold throughout the story have all the nature, the characteristics, the makings of a mystery. Thus, upon reading this book, you must pay careful attention to all that's going on. If you don't pay attention to a certain detail, you may get very mixed up and lost. It is easy to understand why many different versions have been written for kids.The last part of the book is just wonderful. The book, though it may not be the funnest thing to read, is all worth reading for the ending. The ending is one that will stand high in literature.
2 ||| I'm not a fan of Pacino. I did like him in this movie. The plot has a good suspenseful twist. The acting was pretty good. This is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was entertaining and worth watching.
1 ||| The image of this lamp shade shows a surface slope, (approximately 50 degrees) that is much lower than the product received, (approximately 75 degrees). I was disappointed that I didn't get a shade that looked like the picture, but kept the shades that I received because they work and are of good quality.
0 ||| Their old attractant caught TONS of yellow jackets so I am experienced with this trap. The white attractant has not caught anything except a few flies and crickets. The company is great however and has agreed to work with me if I continue to be dis-satisfied. I am giving it one more try and using apple juice this time instead of water.
2 ||| The tempo is fine on all selections. Overall though the best description is VERY BLAND. Does not make you want to dance.
2 ||| I happen to like books with lots of questions to test my readiness for a certain exam. For the most part, this book accomplishes that (hence 3 stars). It does, however, have many subtle errors so you need to check each answer you get wrong with an authoritative resource, like SQL Server Books Online. For example, is says to upgrade SQL 6.5 to SQL 7.0 the SQL 6.5 system needs SP4 - which is incorrect, it needs SP3. Lots of little mistakes like that. By all means, use this book as a resource, but NEVER as your ONLY one. You'd also be wise to double check every wrong answer you get (which of course consumes that much more of your valuable time).
0 ||| This isn't the original art for these books. They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations "less scary". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version.
0 ||| For an item that ended up being the same as your department or drugstore offering, it was expensive and nothing more than ordinary. Plus the company took more than a week in an off-season time to ship the tiny item. It is February...not like Christmas where I would understand.
0 ||| It seems like anything you read about Starflyer59 goes to great length to tell you about how all of the fans of the early work were distraught when the Starflyer59 sound changed with "The Fashion Focus". They basically went from loud, noisy, crap to a much more mature sound. Why everyone thinks it is cool to say that they were into the early stuff, I will never understand. Anyway, now I know how they felt when the sound changed. If you liked "Leave here a stranger" or "Old", I highly doubt you will enjoy this album. In my opinion, it is unlisenable. I only pray that Jason will someday again release more good music and quit with the pseudo-hard rock dreck.
1 ||| The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem. The shoes that arrived had been worn. I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had. He made a good offer however, I decided to wash the shoes and keep them, which I did. Now, I have an infection on my toe. Not good.
2 ||| This book is just a review of their early life, pretty boring, it's just like a normal life. I BTW like Hanson and their music alot, but this book really puts me off.
3 ||| I've been using a Mity-Mite for three years and have never had a problem until now. It won't charge. I've used it to jump my Toyota Tundra (V8) and Honda Civic when the batteries were deader than rocks. I've also jumped my riding mower, which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down (on top of the battery - jumpers and all) to get it to start. Hopefully, my next Mity-Mite will work as well. I wish it had an attachment to blow up tires.
1 ||| I did learn things I didn't know about 1969 Woodstock. But this DVD uses too much video from the oringial movie. There's hours and hours of film that was shot sitting in some Hollywood vault somewhere that could be used. If you enjoyed the original movie you don't really need to buy this one. To much of the same thing over again, althrough the short interviews where a nice touch.
1 ||| If you've used Apache without even reading about any detailed configurations, you'd still not see anything new in this book. I can see this book being a little useful for beginners, but even then, it's not really getting into very detailed information about the configurations and whatnot for module installs/additions. I can see someone new still getting frustrated with this book if they run into a problem.I picked it up, well, because I buy every O'Reilly book that comes out (seriously) and thought I might be able to find something interesting, useful or that I wasn't aware of or forgot... maybe even a little tip about efficiency, compiling options or just anything of interest.This is no more useful than the README and INSTALL files that come with Apache's source code. I'm not sure I want to even give this two stars come to think of it. I just don't see the point to this book. A let down coming from O'Reilly.
3 ||| I bought this product to save my hands. I have very bad arthritis in my hands and the product that I was formerly useing caused a lot of pain in my hands - having to spin lettuce with a crank. This product does not require any turning with the hand. You simply press down on the top and it spins instantly without any pressure or hurt to the hands. It does a great job - fast. I love the difference this has made for me.
4 ||| This book focuses on the special needs of camping in cold weather. It has up to date and accurate information.Includes life saving information on staying warm and hypothermia, packing, and clothing selection. Also information you need to know about special steps to take with food, water, sanitation, first aid, sleep systems, shelter, emergencies, and training for cold-weather camping. And to save you money it has info on how to make your own equipment. Very good little book. Published by the Boy Scouts of America so this information is put to the test every winter.
2 ||| Frankly, I was disappointed in this book--I'm an intermediate Latin student, read the good reviews and decided to buy it. The format is cluttered, the grammatical information presented in a very unhelpful way, and the typography contributes to making it a chore to read--some of it looks like a reproduction of typescript. So I'm still using Wheelock, which within its limits is much more user-friendly. Why hasn't anyone written a more comprehensive Latin grammar for the contemporary student?
4 ||| The best Discworld novel I've read to date, and I own them all....and have read most of them three or four times. Consistently funny, as well as emotionally powerful and philosophically both deep and sound (although you can read it as a straight, non-philosophical story, too, if you're tired).Buy this book. Now. You will not regret it.
2 ||| I only bought it for the song "Strokin". I liked listening to it but I think his older stuff is much better.
0 ||| Finally got the heavy duty static worked out. For those of you still struggling with this, turn the volume on the device you're connecting to up to full blast and then play the headphones at a low volume. The loud popping has to do with the auto on/off feature. I got around the auto on/off feature by twist-tying the adjustable headband to the upper band. Put the twist tie on for on, and remove it for off. Of course that made the headphones only able to fit the Incredible Hulk. The headphones were big to begin with, which is why the auto on/off feature was activated every time you moved your head, frequently cutting out and making listening in any position but stock still an impossibility. If you have a very large head and a full head of hair, and twist ties at the ready, these might work out for you. If you're a normal person who doesn't want to re-engineer a product to make it usable, pass on these. A total waste of money.
2 ||| The book was shipped very quickly, and I appreciate that so much. This was required reading for my daughter, who is a freshman in high school. I also appreciated the fact that it was much more economical, than purchasing a new copy. The book was a little rough, as far as appearance goes, but it is definitely usable! Thank you!
4 ||| personally,and in all honesty,jared's "collapse" was one of the most informative books i have ever read;and i admit it,i,indeed,become afraid of the fate of mankind's destiny and this planet after reading this book of his.people,know how to manage and make the most of your resources,jared's message to us is very touching and important...
0 ||| I did enjoy this book when i first read it two years ago. However, with the invasion of Iraq, I discovered the author, Professor Fukuyama, is a member of the warmongering group (Project for a New American Century PNAC) along with Rumsfield, Pearle, and i think Cheney.Upon relection, it seems this book serves to propagandize to assist in the inflicting of The American Way on weaker nations.Noam Chomsky is a much better source of information on what kind of democracy is practiced by the powerful nations.
0 ||| I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ........turns out it's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels. Seriously ???~~~
2 ||| If only there were like 4 more killings in this one, the movie would flow along better. It's still entertaining...There's only 2 letdowns:1) Too little deaths..3 I think 2) The plot overpowers the suspense
4 ||| Don't you wish you could solve everything with pizza? The Lady with The Alligator Purse can! Parents may remember this as a song from their childhood, but the book brings laughter and a spark to the imagination for children ages 1-10. Not to mention that they will spend a little quiet time later trying to decide what made the baby think he could eat the bathtub!
4 ||| "Cry Freedom" is a novel that I'm passing around to all my friends. The story is truly enjoyable and the characters are unforgetable. I can't wait for the rest of the series!Perhaps my favorite part of the book was the gripping writing. I was impressed by the great descriptions. I felt like I was there!If you'd like a good book to add to your home library, I'd highly recommend this book. But make sure you clear a few hours from your calendar when you first pick it up . . . you won't want to put it down.
4 ||| This is another of Rebas tv seasons, it is great, so nice to watch her whenever we want to and not just when the show is on tv! Reba Rules!
3 ||| saved a ton of money. Sure, you can tell they are used, but they came with the original packaging and the tool itself has little wear and tear. Worth it, for me.
0 ||| I purchased these to replace my old Advent wireless headphones, but these had poor quality sound, lots of hiss that could not be tuned out, and the signal reception was very bad, even within the same room. They were returned.
2 ||| Looks good from far, and might look good on pictures but it's very cheap material. The material is very thin. The buttons are made of plastic and very fragile. I only tried it on and almost broke one of the buttons.You get what you pay for!!!!
3 ||| A very good rock album that appeals to the ladies as well; from complaining in the past that their cds of their prior albums sounded worse than the cassettes of other artists, they can have no complaints here as the remastered versions sound very good indeed. Recommended!
3 ||| I enjoyed this book. Excellent for new-comers and those who are upgrading from VI 1.0. I strongly recommend this book.
0 ||| The copy I received from Amazon.com had only 1 song listed on it. There is no way to select which song you want to listen to since there are no divisions between the songs. It was burned as just one long song. What a rip!
3 ||| An excellent concert & to be enjoyed in HD is another plus. The Eagles actually seem better in their old age now. It must be maturity. Although, the HD DVD did not have camera angle shots as an added bonus, it was still produced well & is an excellent item for the DVD library.
3 ||| my five year old loves it and has been playing it every day since we got it.it's not too loud.We hooked it up to an amplifier and it was louder althoughthe sound quality was still just ok. One little plastic tab broke off the lidthe first day but it still works fine and stays on. We LoVE it.
4 ||| I've been using this product for years and have always found it to be the best....longest lasting, best protectant, easy on the finish. In recent years, it doesn't seem to be as widely distributed at regular retail outlets so I was delighted to find it on amazon. The vendor provided great service with prompt shipment and a fair price. VERY PLEASED CUSTOMER!!!!!
0 ||| It can't be used. The opening between the blades is only about 1/4" wide. It doesn't get any wider than that so if you needed it to cut something...Good luck. It was a total waste of money and I still have a door chain hanging down that needs to come off.
2 ||| It was truely okay. The tape was Okay , Okay , Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, . there is nothing els to say. ART
4 ||| I was told by a really good friend of mine to read this book. Looking in a bookstore on vacation, I came across it. It was cheap so I bought it, not really knowing anything about the story or what I was getting into. But I trust my friend's judgment, so I went ahead and read all of 'The Stranger' this afternoon. WOW is all I can say. The language and storytelling is so simple, so effective, that I got wrapped up in the world that Camus was engaging me in.It reads like Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye', at least in my opinion. He tells the story so clearly. It's one of the most concise books I've ever read. It is quite depressing, but you oddly feel sorry for, and relate to the main character. I feel an odd sense of hope after reading it, and for people that hated it, I can't see what they're talking about. The story will engulf you and not let go until the end. Highly recommended!
3 ||| I use two of these to help ventilate an art studio, and to stay cool at home with less A/C. They move a ton of air. The only down side is that they are a bit noisy, but I don't know if that can be avoided when you're moving so much air.
1 ||| I bought these at Target for my sons. My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart. Not too long in my opinion.
2 ||| Guy Noir is sort of a Philip Marlowe/Sam Spade kind of a guy. His friend of 30 years, Pete, might pass for Miles Archer, Spade's late, lamented partner in "The Maltese Falcon." Each skit involves Guy confronting Pete over some incongruous issue. The duo devise deliciously alliterative dialog, but become belligerent, and the burgeoning bellicosity soon embroils them in a gun battle. They invariably wind up killing each other. Cliche's from the golden age of radio drama abound as the two "friends" deal with all sorts of modern day issues. My first thought upon listening to the first episode was "Dr. Phil meets Philip Marlowe."The first two or three episodes had me laughing out loud, but the longer I listened, the less funny it became. Don't listen to the episodes straight through. Listen to them one at a time, and give yourself a couple of weeks between episodes.
2 ||| Read a lot of reviews and this one got the highest number of positive reviews. This review is written after one , initial use. It is very maneuverable, does a great job sucking up the dirt and is not overly noisy. However, it does not have a shutdown feature for if something big, like the carpet, gets sucked up. Therefore, we have ruined one throw rug- it ate it pretty thoroughly (granted, I had assigned the job to a teenager, but still...). I like the bagless feature and the hand power tool. Another disappointment was the length of the cord for the crevice tool- the reach is very limited- ceiling height, but you have to keep dragging the machine around with you as it has minimal stretch to it. It is also larger than I expected- so it takes up quite a bit of storage space. Overall it is good, but not great.
4 ||| I have always loved South Park but feel that as it started taking on more touchier subjects it became funnier. Cartman changing the words of popular music my inserting "Jesus" and then going plantinum... I love the way South Park makes us laugh at everything from Special Olympics, the news media, to ourselves. I will continue to buy the DVD's as I can't help but laugh no matter how many times I might have viewed them.
4 ||| This is an approachable read about a very difficult subject. The reader, whether a patient, caregiver or relative, will spend 11 months with Patty Gelman as she discusses her emotions, treatments and approach , with humor, to breast cancer. A must read for all caregivers and anyone else touched by this disease.
1 ||| The "inside look" for this book showed color illustrations. When the book came it was all black and white. I talked to a customer service rep and she sent me a second book. It was also in black and white. She said your info was that it was to be in color. I returned the second copy and was credited for the purchase. Your customer service was excellent. The rep even called to check on the second book and apologized for the inconvenience. i cannot recommend this book for anyone with a young child as color illustrations are a must for young children.
1 ||| This is the first Danielle Steel book I've read and the last. The whole premise was unreal. These people were 16 years old, for heaven's sake, and Steel made them so mature as to be unbelievable. It was sappy. The ending was so unsatisfactory I have to wonder: Is there a sequel? If there is, I won't be reading it.
3 ||| Very informative. Covers first aid, and covers symptoms and common treatments for many canine conditions. Has helped me to make the right decision when my vet was pushing for surgery for a hip problem. Because of what I read, I got a second opinion. Turned out, that the hip pain resolved itself after several months of anti inflamatories and supplements and has never come back.Good reference, when my dog had a bladder infection, I wasn't sure if my vet was gouging me with all the tests and meds. By looking it up in this book, I found that the tests were both appropriate and nessesary to ensure the infection was fully erradicated.
0 ||| This movie is terrible.Its just another formulaic piece of hollywood crap. Its a good thing Asimov is dead because he would have died after seeing this horrible movie supposedly based on his novel. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I only gave it one star because you cant give zero stars. The writers,directors,producers,and actors in this movie should be ashamed!!!
4 ||| now my friends cant use the excuse "im used to the ps2 controller" or "i don't like the gamecubes controller" because now you can use ps2 controllers on the gamecube. this is a great investmeant even if you dont have a ps2.
3 ||| Bought three for home & offices. Large heating surface keeps hot coffee hot and warms cooled coffee eventually. Wipe the warming surface after spills; it will last much longer.Wish the "on" light was bigger & brighter as reminder to turn off.
3 ||| My only complaint is that not all exercises identify which muscles are being strengthened. I attend a Golds gym that uses Icarian equipment. Most machines have a front and rear view of the human form with areas of the body highlighted for each muscle being worked for each exercise. It would be nice to have something like this in the book. Other than that, there are 115 pages of exercise technique with pictures. Almost every exercise is covered.
3 ||| you must buy this album if you like rock it's got every thing you could ever want from van halen to the darknessclick on the following link for free downloads of this albumhttp://www.outwar.com/page.php?x=1902610
0 ||| This book really should be removed from circulation. While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read. Examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician.Illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart. Photographs are all poor and dated. The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere. If you are trying to get information on MIDI in the last decade or so, buy a different book.

1 ||| I have never seen an actor so in over her head. Rosario was so over-the-top that it ruined the movie for me.
4 ||| Our son loves this car... fun to ride and looks cool. Kettler makes a great product, it goes superfast, yet is extremely controllable. Only problem is sharing w.the neighborhood kids!
3 ||| I thought Dean Martin was fantastic as Matt Helm.. I enjoyed all 4 movies immensely.. It was great to travel back to the 60's again.. Elke Sommer, Stella Stevens, Ann Margret, and Senta Berger were super..What great flicks!!!!!Rich Crowl
3 ||| Having been recommended by my boss I was skeptical, but this book proved to be a great motivating tool. The two main characters had a specific goal in mind, made the necessary sacrifices to reach it, and never gave up. This was great reading. It makes we want to climb!
0 ||| This is certainly not her best work. I found myself interested in this story but I felt that this story was not very well developed. It had too many occurences and activities that did not make sense. I found that Mac's friends were stiff and unreal unlike they were in the novel where they originated. I think this story had a lot of potential but was so poorly written that I did not enjoy it.
2 ||| My 2 1/2 year old daughter is currently watching this video and she is riveted. She loves the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on tv, so I shouldn't be surprised.I am really pissed off right now though. The video was given to my daughter as a gift from her geat-aunt. The box stated that the video is about a spring party. Only problem--it's actually an Easter party and we are Jewish! If I had known this I would never have allowed this video to be a gift for my daughter. Maybe she will enjoy the Donald hiccups episode, but I will never show her the Easter episode again.
4 ||| I was on the floor I was laughing so hard. You can relate it to your work as well with the jams with paper to dorky co workers and annoying boses
4 ||| This is a wonderful series - I would love to go on BUT I NEED region ONE - I need USA version - PLEASE
3 ||| This is my first leather sandal by Reef and it is growing on me. You need to break it in, unlike their other Reef sandals that are really comfortable from the getgo. This one is becoming more comfortable as I wear it. I am still not taking long walks but it might become one of my favorites.
1 ||| This book reads as if it's only half the story. It's literaly half the length of Griffin's other books (about 250 pages vs. a typical 500 pages). It reads as if Griffin was forced to tack on a quick ending in order to meet a publication deadline. What happened? My guess is that this book was largely written by his son who is a new novelist and perhpas a slower writer than dad. He could not finish the book on time, so the publisher made him quickly come up with an ending for the half finished book so that it could go to press on time.
2 ||| Well-organized list of phrases in twelve languages. It would be ideal for a trip through several different countries in eastern and central Europe, but if you were going to spend any serious time in a single country, you would want more. It has the drawbacks common to all phrasebooks -- the phrases may not be the ones you actually need. Because this one is so compact, there is no room for glossaries or any advice on customs or grammar.Still, it has a lot of phrases in a compact, easy-to-use package.I bought this for a short trip to Romania, where I socialized largely with Hungarian speakers. Didn't need it urgently, and so rarely tested it "under fire" -- doctor, train connections, etc. But it helped me learn a few basic phrases in two different languages at the same time, which allowed me to at least seem polite. (Of course, I kept using Romanian phrases among Hungarians and vice-versa, which defeated the purpose a little, but that's not the book's fault!)
3 ||| I've been a fan of George A. Romero from a long time, and when I saw the remake of NOTLD by Tom Savini... WOW! Tom is good!OK, the camera angles, and the attitude of all characters are a little bit different, but this version gave me the creeps!The ending is excellent!Watch it!
4 ||| Another chilling low budget horror film from William Castle and Robb White. This one has the penniless Zorba family inheriting a haunted house that contains 12 ghosts. They need a 13th to set them free. This has some interesting casting. Margaret Hamilton, who is best known for playing the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 Wizard of Oz, appears as Elaine, the housekeeper who is also a witch. Very fun movie with real ghosts. It can be scary at times, especially the scene where Sy Zorba is locked in a secret room and sees all the ghosts. The spectre of a butcher with a meat cleaver is frightening. Good family entertainment for a stormy night.
4 ||| This movie will be listed as an all time great.I can usually predict who the killer is before the movie ends...But not this time.Every time I watch it I always end up saying " I didnt know he/she was in the movie.I think Pattie LaBelle did a great job, the short time she was in the movie.I dont write reviews unless a movie is really bad or one you should add to your collection . This is one you NEED to add to your collection.
1 ||| If your restoring your own camaro, (and you do your own restoration work) you'd think this would be a good book to get. However, if your like me, you already own the GM overhaul/chasis manual, the fisher body manual, the wiring diagram and the factory assembly manual. I bought this book thinking it would aid me in restoring my camaro. Instead, this book is nothing but a bunch of diagrams/clips taken from the books mentioned above but in much less detail.I am surprised the other two reviews were real positive because if you already have the factory manuals, it renders this book useless and quite lacking. This book does have a good bit of facts and codes but if your looking for that type of info, go for the Big Book of Camaro Data.For real "how to" type applications and in a step-by-step procedure in bringing your camaro back to life I recommend the Camaro Restoration Handbook by Currao and the Camaro Owner's Handbook by Sessions. Check 'em out.
1 ||| I'm sure these are great socks, but I was slightly disappointed when I thought I was getting 3 pairs for the price listed...my package arrived and there was only one pair for the stated price. I feel like the image with 3 socks was deceptive and "false advertising", as it states nowhere else how many pairs are sold for the stated price. Hope I enjoy the socks, but thought I'd warn everyone else before they buy these and expect more than what you'll receive.
4 ||| I bought this book for my little girl when she was just over one, purely for the beautiful illustrations. Well - she ooooohed and aaaaahed in mock horror at the bad animals stealing Handa's fruit and at the end rolled around laughing. It's now daily reading material and never fails to delight her. It has introduced her to different animals and fruits so well and it's so lovely to have a children's picture book set in a culture other than English/American. And the illustrations are without doubt the best of any I've seen. Definite for any child's library
3 ||| I got this meat tenderizer today and as always oxo has made a great product however I must admit I was a little dissapointed that it CANNOT BE PUT INTO THE DISHWASHER. The dishwasher is a staple in my everyday life... I clean everything with it...and its a bummer I cant put the tenderizer in it too... oh well... its still a well made product.
2 ||| This 2nd installment in the Temperance Brennan series neither disappointed nor amazed me. There are far fewer terrible similes, "to say I was cold would be like saying Lady Godiva was undressed," but the plot was far too coincidental to be believable. Once again the novel concludes with a Scooby Doo summary, but the crime procedurals are accessible and interesting and the characters likeable. Sometimes. Perhaps that is why I am enjoying Reichs Tempe Brennan series. The lead character is so believably flawed. I am anxious to see what develops between Brennan and Ryan and I can't help but wonder how many novels it will take for Tempe to realize she should at least pack some mace in her bag before she goes wandering off alone in an attempt to assert her self-reliance.
0 ||| "Grease" is a dopey movie, with silly jokes, innuendo, and fluffy songs. But this is only part of what is wrong with the movie. Worst of all is the message it sends: girls if you want to keep your boyfriend go lose on him. Sad that a movie like this is glorified so much.
3 ||| I felt this book did not pack as much punch as the first 4, but that's not to say I didn't like it. I liked it a lot, actually, and thought the ending was very good. Nynaeve vs Moghedien was awesome! And I (like everyone I'm sure) am dying to know who Asmodean sees at the end. Here's hpping that both Moiraine AND Lanfear are still alive and duking it out somwhere.
2 ||| I have seen Kelly Clarkson so much that I thought I would buy her CD. For the most part, it's evident that she's a newcomer to the music business. Her slurring of words and breathy singing doesn't quite do it for me. I enjoyed the track "Anytime" and her duet with Tamyra Gray, but other than that, this CD didn't really do anything for me. I think Clive Davis needs to rethink what American IDOL means.
3 ||| This is a great story of a very special friendship shared by two middle school boys,Kevin and Max. Kevin is a victim of a very rare physical disability, and it prevents him from living a normal person's life. Kevin is a very intelligent boy, and he lives in the world of his imagination. Max is an obese boy who suffers from emotional problems and a learning disability. He has failed the seventh grade several times. The boys start becoming friends when Kevin starts helping Max with his reading skills. Here is where the journey begins. These boys have nothing in common, but they can relate to each other about being outcasts, and being abandoned by their fathers at a very early age. Kevin's magical world of knights and their journy for justice is closer to reality than the two boys might think. Through their adventures, they not only become best friends, they become brothers.
1 ||| Was very surprised this was a lift the flap book as there was no indication of that in the title or descriptions / reviews. I am debating returning it. Pictures are very cute but really repeats the same thing page after page. Does an elephant use the potty? No, A bear, No etc. Flaps are separate pages attatched by 1/8 inch seam which my 2 year old could easily rip off if I don't add more tape. Maybe that is why they list it as for 4yr olds... but most of them would not need this book. See The Potty Book for Boys (maybe there is one for girls) by Alyssa Satin Capucilli for a more diverse book. It also has quite durable pages!
2 ||| I think quirky is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Flambards. I love the time period of 1902 onward. The costuming and the interiors/exteriors are top-notch but that silly music that the other reviewers mention is indeed annoying and is so irrelevant to the storyline. I was not watching PBS and British dramas in the late 70's so I am not familiar with any of the actors who star in the series. I am surprised it has not been re-made since it has alot of potential with the right cast and a better soundtrack. I am on disc three, so I am anxious to see how it wraps up. The music really ruins this in my opinion since it sounds too contemporary for the time period. I prefer Monarch of the Glen or Berkeley Square which are both well written and acted without the awful music.
4 ||| Installed in a 2002 Dodge Neon and now the stereo has an input for anything with a 3.5 mm output jack.
4 ||| This novel was passed along to me over the Thanksgiving holiday and although I'll be the first to say that I am not a romance reader, I found this one to be a pleasant surprise. I was told that it was romance, but I saw it more as a relationship book because there was a whole lot more than romance in here. When I was handed this book, my words were, "If I don't like it, I'm sure gonna put it on Amazon." Well, I really dug this book and since I was so ready to post a bad response to it, I thought it was only fair for me to pull my foot out of my mouth and post a good one. While the only Christian books I generally do are non-fiction, I had to take the time to to give this the props it deserves.
1 ||| This book is not up to standards clancy used us to. It is less gross than sum of all fears, but still, at points it is even boring. Strong language to fill a content vacuum and repetitions are common. Rayan is not the pleasant character he used to be - he has become arrogant and pretentious. A true disappointment.
1 ||| This 30th Ann. edition suffers from the most washed-out, faded, overexposed looking digital transfer I have ever seen. I quit after the first episode (and spot checking some others). And this was on a new Aquos 65 inch flat screen. What was Acorn Media thinking when they put this out? Was the original material in that poor a condition? I returned my copy for a refund.
1 ||| I like Clancy's earlier books but I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this. One dimensional characters, a predictable plot-- hey the good guys always win!-- and way too long. You want good action, check out Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE, Bob Mayer's CUT OUT or DRAGON SIM-13, or Bob McGuire's THE GATE.
0 ||| I have to agree with some of the other reviews on here, these movies were not very good. It actually hurt to watch them. The actors who relaced Fairlight, David, and Miss Alice are just not very good at all. I REALLY wish I would not have bought them. Stuart Finlay-McLennan is the ONLY reason that I bought these, to see how the love story ended. I should have stuck with the book, which the ending is enough for me now.
2 ||| I am using this book in a class I am currently teaching. It's fine, gives a decent rundown on the major plagues and includes non-infectious plagues which adds another dimention to the text. Still, it is a tad brief for anything much other than an overview.
2 ||| While reading this book it forces you to think, which is excellent. However I found myself annoayed at some of Mason's comments as alot of what he says is semi-controversial and he seems to try to make everything over controversial, more so than it has to be.
1 ||| "Lost Horizon" is definitely not the best book I have ever read. It starts out with four men talking about different things when they come to the conclusion that they all know Hugh Conway, who was kidnapped along with three others. Their plane crashes in the mountains, and they are rescued and taken to a place called Shangri-La. Here they experience a lot of peace because Shangri-La is away from the ongoing war. Many things happen, and Conway along with one of the others decides to leave. This is the way the book ends, except for the Epilouge where Rutherford again talks about Conway and tries to figure out where he is. This book is definitely for those who like weird things. It was not the best book for my tastes.
2 ||| I know that overall men's fitness should include sex (and lots of it) but I tire of hearing it from a magazine whose main focus should be fitness, wellness, and health. I'm not purposing to eliminate it completely, because as we all know sex sells, I just saying minimize it! I can read all about sex in Playboy! I would suggest buying Men's Health- it's a better read.
4 ||| Very gald these guys are back, this is the debut album by Hallows Eve and it's brutal, hard edged, pure thrash the way it was ment to be. When I think of the pure 80's thrash metal sound I always think of Hallow's Eve and their first three glorious albums. Solid release, Worth every cent! \m/\m/
3 ||| My 6 year-old and 10 year-old grandsons loved "Forbidden Planet!" This "early" science fiction adventure movie features an amazing robot named Robby. My grandsonswere mesmerized by his strength and peaceful attitude. The romantic aspects of the movie were mostly light-hearted and elicited just a few "yucks!" I enjoyed this oldie but goodie film. If you are a science fiction fan (of any age), you'll get a kick out of "Forbidden Planet!"George Hargrove
0 ||| This lancing device does not work.It doesn't bring the lancet out to pierce my finger.I called the seller and they refused to take the item back.Horrible experience and waste of money.Do not buy from these people.Big rip-off!!!
1 ||| Forget what the CGI nerds are saying. This film was utterly overdone.Too longPointless actionAbsurd situatons with the CharactersGo see it yourself. Be your own judge. Don't be a sucker for what these clowns are claiming. PJ is a good director. But King Kong will be the film most remember for it's mediocre storytelling and entertainment.
0 ||| I was very disappointed in this book. I found the character development poor and I was tired of Tanya in each chapter discussing her desire to leave Curtis but why she couldn't. She also spent a great deal of time discussing abused women and too much detail on clothing, cars, coach bags, etc.. which was unnecessary for me. Overall, I was not impressed. I also did not find the writing challenging. This is no J. California Cooper or Toni Morrison.
3 ||| I ran into Elvis @ LAX several months ago. I was in a vitriolic mood and returned the tape (Spyke) I'd been listening to all week on the Central Coast in my renta car. So while I was smoking a cigareet outside the terminal, the big limo pulls up and out falls a phalnyx of Elvis' employees. I think maybe it was just the way his entourage was kind of choreographed plus a bad week in Santa Barbara, put me in a foul mood. But fortunately, at the Airlines Club, Elvis was at the center of the bar ordering Cranberry Juice and soda. I decided to adjust my attitude and I asked the bartender to find out if Elvis would take a second, which he did with considerable courtesy. It's really cool to see how courteous this guy can be. Don't forget what he's done for other artists, like Roger McGuinn. What was way cool was that remembering all those lyrics,was, he told me, like doing crossword puzzles. Hope Elvis next collaborator is Van Morrison.
1 ||| Teachers in Touch had a difficult time discussing this book. Most of the members could not relate to the language used by the author and had a hard time finding the humor. One member actually liked the book and said she laughed through her reading. Overall, our ratings averaged 1.5, but we'll round up to a 2.
1 ||| They could have cut the first hour out and it still would be a waste of time. The only good thing about this movie was King Kong. Its a shame what they did to such a great classic film.
4 ||| What a great story from Nora Roberts! Loved the characters and couldn't put it down. Great summer read. Also check out Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin - WOW!
0 ||| Even though I was looking forward to reading this book, I was disappointed. Julie Powell is a terrible writer. She seems to have a boring relationship with her husband, an unsatisfactory sex-life, and a quite bitchy attitude. This would have made for interesting reading if well written. Powell should have stayed writing blogs, since her style does not translate well to books.
4 ||| This game basically combines the games Memory (where you turn over tiles to make matches) with Clue. The production value is low, but the game play is good and the artwork and theme are fun. Makes me want to try other games by Family Pastimes.
0 ||| I really looked forward to this book, based on my respect for Tom Brokaw and what I had heard. Unfortunately, he makes his point with a sledgehammer, telling sapppy stories with the same theme over and over, spoon feeding you the point, in case you somehow missed it. Grandma and Grandpa were great, generous, self-sacrificing gods and goddesses, and here are a thousand treacly repetitive stories why. This book condescends to the reader, unfortunately, probably with all good intentions but annoying results. I wasn't able to finish this book, and that's rare for me.
1 ||| Absolutely the worst album of Marilyn Manson. I am a big fan of his music but I must say that. Buy this CD only if you need it desperately for your MM collection. It contains only a few not bad songs like (s)aint, mOBSCENE, Para-Noir and Vodevil and even those songs do not make this album worth of bying or even listening second time. It is a huge disappointment. Never expected such a weak album from such a great performer.
1 ||| Too many words for not enough pictures. As a teacher I would have it out for reading time..or on my shelf but it is definately not a read aloud book...I hate picture books with too many words!
4 ||| I think this is well worth the cost. I'm always trying to reach the knots in my back or making my husband massage them. This makes it easy for me to reach the spots myself.
2 ||| Oh boy, another wutang album hits stores. Even though I have always been suspicious of wutang solo albums ever since the massive failures that followed Raekwon's solo, i always take a look at the albums for fun. As far as mainstream goes these days, this album wasnt too bad compared to Methodman's latest and Ghost's 2001 "Bulletproof Wallets". Thouh he lacks the usual raekwon colllabo. and a variety of topics in his songs, this album is decent, but dont pay more than 10 bux for it as im sure your local record store will probably have a few used ones after awhile.
3 ||| My son loves trains, and I love Bell helmets--so this matches both of our preferences! It's a little hard to adjust the straps at first, but overall seems very durable but not heavy for his little head. :)
2 ||| now i dont like trans formers and in a kid but i think this game would be fun i mean i hope they put more effort into the game then they did with the show. ya sure little kids watch the show and they like it and us big kids hate it and the big kids even most grownups might even like it. its a shooting game without any blood. and my parents hate games with blood so what im saying is its a game that you can shoot and kill robots a drive,fly,ect. and most likley most parents will aprove of it so im kind of lookin forward to it.
4 ||| Pretty good. Almost like my album from ages ago. I wouldn't have gotten a CD, but it's impossible to play/listen to an album in the car!
3 ||| This is an exciting book to read. The story of God's protection of Hezikiah from his youth. Full of political intrigue it takes places in a dangerous time for Israel both physically and spiritually. The suspense and horror in the book grabs the reader. I will try other books in this series.
4 ||| Love These! However, do not buy these with the big block activity center, they don't work! A bit dissapointing. But the blocks are really cute and I do like them a lot!
0 ||| I don't know what to make of the Opteka Digital Duplicator. I am trying to use it on my Nikon D60 DSLR. I have a 55-200 mm zoom lens and an 18-55 mm. I have been trying to get a decently focused image, but, try as I may, I get a blurred image using either lens. I write this hoping somebody will tell me what I need to do.
3 ||| This cable works great used on my dvd player with easylink to tv. audio and video work right from the start no problems like other cables.Only knock i have is with the description, it states is Xbox 360 compatible, but cannot use this directly with an Xbox 360. You have to buy a Xbox Specific cable, not a so called compatible one.
0 ||| I an now on my second of these readers and this one, just like the one it replaced, now is not recognized by my Dell computer. Both worked fine for 6-12 months but then died.
4 ||| This is the only dry cat food my picky cat will eat. Plus the vet said his teeth are looking better now that he has been eating it, when I adopted him he had bad tartar/plaque and early gum disease. He has much less hairballs now too! My younger cat eats mostly this dry food. My older cat still prefers his canned food but always saves room for this too.
4 ||| Very complete information. Extremely helpful. Let's of sources and contact information. Definite must buy!
3 ||| Captures what was happening in the Hip-Hop scene in San Francisco, back in the early 90's. UDI (Under Da Influence) is a duo composed of Dig (Derrick Reed) and Quint (Quinton Morris) two natives of San Francisco, California, whose reserve demeanor belie the raw game found in the content of their music. This duo incorporates their love of music and their love of the game to create a sound guaranteed to have you high off the vibe.Not to mention the intoxicating affects of their mesmerizing grooves, which will have you body entranced into some rump-shaking moves. The hypnotic beat of 'Thug Thang' will have you on the edge of your seat and 'Eyes On My Ride' and 'Smoke Wit Me'for sure will move you onto the dance floor. Don't forget to roll your blunt, for 'All I Want To Do'.This was the only album UDI ever put out, due to their untimely deaths not too long after this release.
1 ||| Uffindell clearly spent lots of time walking the battlefield and has an excellent knowledge of it. He is also enthusiatic about his subject and the book is a good read. However, it is bad history. Too often, the myths about the campaign are repeated as fact. Too often questionable statements by Uffindell's hero Wellington are taken at face value. Of course, the British did nothing worng in this campaign and foreigners like the Prince of Orange, Dornberg and Ziethen are to blame for Wellington's errors. This book is very much inferior to Hofschroer's work.
2 ||| Though I found The Chronicles of Ridddick seemed to be a good idea when first heard about, I found the execution to be lacking and was sorely disappointed. The concept is great, but there are so many plot holes and the characters are so uninteresting that I could have cared less. It seems to be a wasted effort, though I appreciate the ambitious storyline. The whole thing seems to come off as mediocre at best. I thought it could have been done much better and they COULD have achieved the original grand sci-fi film that they were hoping to make, which would be nice considering how many movies these days are rehashed from comics and books. Perhaps the DVD release will make up for what the theatrical release lacked. Better luck next time guys.
1 ||| I was so excited about getting a coin purse. Especially one that was handmade. I'm upset because I received a plain old black and white one which wasn't even in the picture. It also felt a little weird because I'm black. Also I can't ever seem to get this thing open. I try extremely hard and it takes me about 12 tried to open it. It would really help if they let you atleast describe what you want like say you want it colorful or not plain or something like that.
3 ||| See storyline aboveA top-notch thriller with graphic scenes of the emergency room (and Clydes room) with highly descriptive and obviously well researched treatments. It's a story of one doctor's personal ethics. It's a story that packs a lot of suspense with a lot of personal issues. The pace stays fairly strong throughout the story with just an occasional lag.Recommended
3 ||| I read this book in a few hours. I couldn't put it down. Although, some may say this is a predictable plot the book's real gift is the last fifty pages. It's Noah's enduring love for Allie past their "perfect summer" that makes you cry. Someone said they wanted more written on their past and that would be a mistake. Reading how Nicholas Sparks wrote how Allie and Noah were afer 40 years of marriage is what makes their love a rare and true love.I would NOT read this after a break-up or if you are yearning for someone.
4 ||| The reason I bought this book was because of the emphasis on healing. It works! Buy it. Try it. You will be glad you did!
0 ||| So, Kurt Vonnegut had an interesting brain cramp, granted. Was it worth the rental price and a half-hour to watch it? Definitely not! The clip (and I must call it a clip owing to its brevity) was a complete waste of time and money. There was no plot or character development whatsoever, from what I saw. It is in interesting concept, yes--but it truly deserved a better and more thorough treatment.
4 ||| Along with the infamous "Rocky Horror," this has to be the coolest musical ever. The songs, the actors, the script, the visuals! it's all so much to take, but it's definately worth watching! Brian de Palma should have made more films like this underrated gem of a cult film!
1 ||| this one is just too gorey,it's stupid.the worst acting that i have ever seen.the only thing good was that it was a little funny cause freddy always makes some funny jokes.
1 ||| One must have caution when reading an Alfred Price book. Some of them are great, some of them are junkie. This one here belongs to the second category!
2 ||| I bought this and a family member gave it to my mom as a Christmas present. The item itself works just fine. Nothing exceptional about the picture quality, but also nothing to complain about. Does have a remote which was a must. It doesn't support a wide range of memory card formats, but it does the most popular one (SD).My biggest complaint is that the frame looks very cheap. For that kind of money, they could have at least put a decent looking frame around the screen. I was a little embarrased to give this since it looked so cheap. If it wasn't that it was a last minute gift, I would have shopped around a little more and possibly sent it back.This sounds like a horrible review, but I was just very disappointed in the frame. Of all that I have seen in the stores (and almost all stores sold these since they were a hot item this Christmas) this by far looked the cheapest.
0 ||| The title of this video states that it is VOL 2 of the Bell Telephone Hour video, something that has been available for several years now. In fact, these two videos are the same; there is no VOL 2 of the Bell Telephone Hour video. It is an excellent video, however, just don't buy it if you already have the first one that was issued.
0 ||| This game was definately not worth the hype (If there was any). I remember seeing a commercial for it and I was thinking "GTA ripoff" and it pretty much is. GTA is alot better than this in everything, this game was to bland. I got bored with this really, really quick.
4 ||| man that movie was great i liked the part were squeeky had a mask and was trying to anoye the other player and it didn't work so he took of the mask and the guy fell over.
0 ||| I am amazed at how such poorly crafted lyrics could make it in the big time. The singing is affected indeed. Whiney 90s style. Backed up with a good band, however, I could write a better song sitting in the bathroom with my son pounding on the door!
3 ||| A New Beginning is a good movie with a good polt, but it has a long way to go before it can surpass the original. The writers did a good job in explaining how another dragon could be alive if Draco was the last. The story is heartwarming, and the action scenes are good. The animation isn't as good as the original either. THis is a great movie for kids to see as it has a good message, but if your looking for another original Dragonheart, then this isn't the mvoie for you!
1 ||| I bought this book because it appeared to be the only book in modern English, available in Amazon, that would be a good translation of Tyndale's New Testament. I browsed Tyndale's "original" version online, and the letters are just hard to read for me in his old English. This book appeared to be the best option, except that when I began to read it, the common literary voice of traditional Bibles is not there. The literary voice that appears to come out is the author's.Since he is no Paul, Moses, or Tyndale, just as few examples, this book is not a keeper for me. The Bible, no mater what translation it is, is supposed to be the Word of God, the voice of God, does it not?In terms of translation and grammar, well, probably there should be relatively little problem here.
4 ||| Very good information to know to see the other sides view of life and how they interact with the world and what we do.
4 ||| I WAS AFFRAID TO ORDER THEM BECAUSE THE LAST PAIR I BOUGHT A FEW MONTHS AGO WERE AWFUL AND ALREADY WORN OUT. I PAID $54.00 FOR THEM THROUGH AMAZON. WHEN I SAW A PICTURE OF THESE SLIPPERS FOR UNDER $15, I HESITATED TO BUY THEM. BOY, AM I GLAD I DID BUY THEM, I LOVE THEM.JOANNE H. STEWART
0 ||| I've read all Cornwell's books - but, man, this is the last one. I thought the other series she does was boring, but Black Notice is not only poorly written it is as dull as a desk job.Maybe Cornwell could take her foot off the pedal for a couple of years - despite lost earnings (and judging from her alter ego Scarpetta, Cornwell now has Dollar Signs in her eyes). She is definitely in need of some new ideas.Harping on about Benton is pointless: Benton was boring. Giving the reader details about Lucy's sex life is pointless: Lucy is boring. The only two interesting characters, Scarpetta and Marino she has now reduced to caricatures. Cornwell wants the reader to see Scarpetta as a brilliant, incisive investigator - but she comes off as a paranoid harpy - a bit the way her creator comes off in interviews.And Scarpetta as dominatrix with her suddenly irresistible appeal to younger (but apparently gay) men? Give me a break.
0 ||| This movie was...terrible.I can usually tolerate some pretty stupid stuff, but Jenny and Carmen's acting in this movie was atrocious. And it wasn't funny. At least Eddie is a sweetheart.
3 ||| I finally own this movie and I got it for an amazing price from amazon! I'm very happy customer. I Highly recommend this movie and amazon.
0 ||| This was perhaps the absolute worse Jonathan Kellerman going!I have read at least two-thirds of his novels most of which are quite pleasing and entertaining, some more wierd than others...Not good at all! Really!At any rate, I agree completely ( as does my wife), who feels as did a recent reviewer; it would be incredibly fantastic to find that this novel was not something from his distant past, that was now thrown in for a quick hit....It was formal, unlike any other of his novels, truly BORING X 10, and we barely got through it on a relaxing summer vacation.Both of us felt it was just terrible at best! Rent it on audio book at the library, that way you can stand the horribly slow plot culminating in a relatively exciting (much needed) ending....
0 ||| I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.
1 ||| The book starts out promisingly and expecatations rise. As the plot develops however, Fasman gets lost. He explains little or nothing about the objects'powers and the whole point of collecting the items by the deceased is lost on me. Also the so-calld most important item, the Emerald Tablet is barely mentioned except in the end and it is left hanging in the air, doing nothing.It is a pity that a potentially good plot was dropped by the wayside because the author did not know where to take it next.My advice: save your money and buy something else.
3 ||| Great product, works just as advertised. EVen did a great, gentle, job with Berries. Was given to me as gift, when I was in a tiny apartment. I had no cabinet space so it became a, decorative piece above my fridge when not in use. But that is not OXO's fault. I really enjoy this product.
0 ||| These were really awful. After reading the great reviews on the worthing vegetarian hot dogs and meat I was real hopeful, but they were just gross. We do love the morning star veggie dogs though. They taste a lot closer to the real thing. These veggie dogs were very mushy and just broke in half when I tried to take them out of the can. Very disappointing. We are a vegetarian family of 6 and no one would eat them.
0 ||| see the 2 star "J. R. South" 12/26 review, who seems to be the only reviewer who saw the same movie I saw,the specifics of the critique are right on point - no need for me to repeat - don't know what these other reviewers saw, this is just a flat out badly conceived and produced movie, started looking at my watch after 45 minutes, if you pass this one by you will have missed nothing, if you go - then make sure to come back and write a ridiculous rave review and don't forget to mention "Oscars"
0 ||| Running Blind is a great book, as are all of Lee Child's books. Retitling it and selling it as The Visitor is a dirty trick on those of us always on the lookout for a new Jack Reacher book.
4 ||| I love this cd and I highly recommend it. You may have heard many Christmas songs but Ella's voice is golden, you can't go wrong, I hope that you'll love it too.
0 ||| I purchased it for my students to show them the power of wind. Old footage, not great in comparison to what is shown on TV. Never showed ot to my students because it is just not "cool" enough. I am sure if this documentary was redone by NOVA today it would be significantly better. If you are looking for short impressive footage you will have more luck on the internet.
4 ||| I've had a lot of trouble finding a paper diaper that fits my 29 1/2" long, 23lb 7 month old boy, he's a wiggler, jumper, tosser, turner, and roller, but these seem to fit really well. We've had no poo up the back (even when he poo'd while jumping in his bouncer) and no leaks overnight, both of which were problems before. I haven't had any rashes from chemicals, dyes, or perfumes which was also a problem with other brands in the past.
3 ||| The playstation is a great system. It is no longer the fastest machine, and it is no longer has the best graphics but it is still good. The playstation is ...... and for that low price you get a selection of games from the most massive game selection there is and the games are very cheap. If you buy the drteamcast or N64 you end up paying ......... for one game. you can get three, four, or almost five very good games for the price of one DC or N64 game. The one downside is the loading speeds. The playstation is pretty slow but the games are worth the wait. For example, own the game Mayhem (it's a wrestling game) and it takes 20-30 seconds to load a game, but once it loads it's the best smashing, bashing, and slashing game there is out. So if you are wondering what sytem to get I say playstation or nothing!
0 ||| I ordered the Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna. They keep sending the Cobra HG A1000. Now I'm stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I want.
2 ||| Works ok if you have a spray that cleans the grout. Maybe can use on other surfaces in the house.
3 ||| "Million Dollar Baby" is a film that has been getting rave reviews, so i decided to go see it. The first twenty minutes or so seemed like it was going to drag on (THAT'S THE REASON I'M ONLY GIVING IT FOUR INSTEAD OF FIVE), but soon afterwards the film was amazing. It was a touching phenomenon that was brilliantly filmed, written, and acted. Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood, along with co-star Morgan Freeman, are brilliant, and the ending of the film is touching and riveting. GO see it now!!!
3 ||| It is a good movie overall, but way too predictable and after seeing the first movie, it was a step down. I would recomend the movie. It was worth the money.
1 ||| re-make of the not so great original has The Lutz Family, husband George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds (Blade: Trinity, The Alarmist) and Mrs. Lutz played by Melissa George (Tv's Alias, Sugar & Spice). They move in and find out that there was a murder that happened in that house. Soon, things start to boil up as the man of the house, George Lutz hears voices to tell him to kill his family because they are demons. "House's dont kill people, people kill people." explains George. Mrs. Lutz thinks something array as she sees her husband is transforming into a monster. Not much fun really, just like the original with some pretty boring blood splattering moments though Reynolds is very confincing in his psycho-possessed performance and some pretty good direction. Also starring Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) as the priest. Michael Bay Produced and he also did Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I have no clue why he produced that and this.
2 ||| It's more like going out to eat at a really nice place with an odd looking woman. I think the fast food comparison is better suited to Warrant, or some such radio friendly garbage. All of Maiden's efforts are pretty classy. But agreed: this one doesn't work as well as their best.
2 ||| Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them.
1 ||| I cant believe either that this book was recommended for my class. It offers no insight om how to blend everthing you learn to make a quality layout. You can teach yourself the same things in the book just by tril and error. Those masterpieces in the middle dont help the beggimer out either.
2 ||| The jelly beans were tasteful and very flavorful, however, when I received my package the jelly beans were all mixed in with each other and that was a big disappointment to me. The jelly beans should have been sealed into each square..it doesn't seem to be 50 flavors..there are some empty squares.
4 ||| I don't know much about comics, but my boyfriend said it was the best gift I had ever given him. We have been dating for 7 years, so it was saying a lot.
3 ||| This game certainly puts a whole different spin on Tomb Raider games. If you're a DIE HARD Laura Croft fan then this game is for you. I haven't played any Tomb Raider's since Tomb Raider II on Playstation 1 and I STILL liked this game. Most reviewers say it was a horrible game, but I certainly enjoyed it. I like solving puzzles in a sense that you become part of the puzzle and this game does exactly that.
3 ||| Let's cut to the chase. You know what the movie is about. But what you don't know is that Van Dam became an actor. He is totally convincing in the dual roles. As the serial killer he shows us a dark side to his personality which works on all accounts. Focused and confident. As the Clone (Replica) he shows his more sensitive side. He even get's to do a little bit of the Tom Hanks in "Big" routine. Though I will admit I like him in the villan role. In all, the movie moves very well by the sure hands of it's director Ringo Lam. It has some very violent and realistic scenes that will frighten younger viewers so parents please be responsible and do not let them watch it at all. It is rated R. Thanks Van Dam for a excellent film.Some other Van Damm Films I recommend:TimecopSudden DeathMaximum Risk (Ringo Lam, Dir)Hard Target (John Woo, Dir)Nowhere to HideDeath Warrent
1 ||| I was not satisfied with this book. I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that it is very basic - I think it might be helpful to someone who doesn't have much cooking experience, but if you do it won't help you much. I doubt I will make anything from this book, and I have to say nothing really sounded that great. One of my main problems with this book it that every chicken recipe called for boneless, skinless breasts - how un-frugal can you get?? That is absolutly the most expensive way to buy chicken, and don't tell me it is the only healthy option - it won't kill your family to eat chicken legs once it a while. Give me a break! If you are new to both cooking and frugality, you might get something out of it, but otherwise, take my word for it - you already know everything the author has to say.
4 ||| In my opinion, Richard Webster's Revealing Hands is quite simply the best introduction to the fascinating subject of palmistry. Students will find the material to be concise and easily comprehensible, unlike many other chirological texts. This fine book is a mandatory addition to the library of any aspiring or professional palmist.
3 ||| Finally something that actually does what it claims and doesn't break the first time or comes with a bunch of defects and glitches. This is a great product. You can make different kind of sounds with it as you gain more experience. I would recommend this product!
0 ||| The battery looked a bit used and scratched; worst of all it just plain did not work. I tried to charge it but it remain in 0% no matter what I did.
4 ||| Besides the Bible this is the best book I have ever read. Very helpful for a new christian.
4 ||| A Nightmare on Elm Street is a film that focuses on what happens when people do not communicate well. It preys on the universal fear of the unknown, and what the unknown will bring. This is why ANOES is a classic film.Craven has created a cast of characters that mesh together very well, and of course Robert Englund brings his own style to the archetypal Freddy Kreuger.Additionally, the extras on these DVDs are RAD, there is so much stuff to discover that you'll be watching them for a long time. It also features an option that puts facts up while you're watching the film, you can select the facts and it will then show the bonus feature that accompanies it.Overall, ANOES is the groundbreaker for the series, and many other horror films to follow it. Scared the crap out of me as a kid, and it still does.
3 ||| This movie has almost no chance to make anybody happy. Constantine graphic novel fans will be disappointed because the character is changed and quite different from the books. Keanu fans won't see Neo (except for some time when Constantine was indecisive) and there aren't super kung fu fight sceens.That said, it's a slow moving, laid-back plot with a lot of back story which takes a bit to figure out. Rachel Weisz is very good but her character isn't developed as completely as it should have been. Keanu plays it very laconic (which, after all, is his strength) and it mostly works. But I think he should have been a bit more animated and I would have been interested in some sparks between him and Rachel.All in all, this is actually a pretty interesting movie, part The End of Days and part The Omen. I did enjoy it and I'm likely to get the dvd. Give it a rent, it's definitely worth a look.
0 ||| THIS TOY IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. IT DOESN'T DANCE AND YOU CANT UINDERSRTAND WHAT IT IS SAYING. DONT WASTE YOUIR MONEY!
3 ||| I am about half way through this book, enjoying it very much. Keeps you wanting to read, well written. Give this book a try, nice change from modern time story lines...
1 ||| This was a simplistic novel. The characters lacked credibility and their personalities were stereotypical. The plot was unwielding and unsatisfying. It was difficult to figure out who the ultimate killer was because it was totally unrealistic. Grisham's novels always have a feel good aspect to them (i.e. lawyer finds his way; justice prevails) and I think that is what hooks the reader. The quality of the book is secondary. There are so many better writers out there ( Elizabeth George, Laura Lippman, Peter Robinson). I suggest readers give these authors a chance. You won't be sorry.
0 ||| i'm STILL waiting to receive it since Xmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't seem to track it and don't know who to send an email to????????????can you help track this down????????????
1 ||| There is obviously a need for such a book. However, Microsoft Press suggests this book for intermediate to advanced users. I would target this at beginning to (perhaps) intermediate users. Others will be disappointed as I was.Lots to disagree with here as well. A recomendation is made to only place ByRef in parameter definitions if the user INTENDS to change the parameter while in the routine. ByRef parameters which the user does not intend to change receive no prefix. Not the best advice. Another section suggests branching to a graceful exit point if input data is invalid. Since invalid input data generally suggests a problem elsewhere in the code, a better suggestion is assertion (a subject not discussed and perhaps out of scope) and/or raising an error. Some of the treatments seem pretty shallow - for example, the section on error handling is more a tutorial on the basic error object.
1 ||| Skip protection does not work. I cannot wear it and walk on the treadmill at a brisk pace. The buttons do not work reliably either. I can push a button several times before the feature engages. This was a cute color, but performance wise, it's just another piece of junk.
0 ||| I continue to search the pages of this book for "guidance." All I seem to find are very negative, very opinionated statements on what the author wants to convey are the ONLY ways that you can carry, birth and raise twins. The last thing a parent of multiples needs is reading that they've been doing it wrong. We are all one step away from insanity in those first months and surely want to read something more objective and encouraging. Don't waste your time getting depressed from reading this book.
4 ||| I gave this as a gift to my friend and her husband who were having a hard time getting pregnant. It worked like a charm!!! They are now proud parents and they've asked me to be the godmother!*anyone know where I can find 1,547 one legged onesies? oh, and the neck hole should be large enough to accomdate two heads.
2 ||| While Harry Pidgeon's feat of sailing around the world is exceptional, and his writing style clear and concise, he offers few insights into sailing or his life. The book is fashioned after Joshua Slocum's "Sailing Alone Around The World:" Or equally as likely, Pidgeon and Slocum were two men of a like mind. In any event, both men portray that 19th century reserve so characteristic of the Englishmen. Such reserve in the face of near scrapes with death maybe admirable, but it does not make for as interesting reading.
4 ||| It was great I loved this book it was the best and it is all about Christmas time with families
2 ||| first i have to say this is the first book i have read of PC. I was ready to dive into a new author. the story was awesome, the plot thickened, people she knew were getting killed and she id to blame, so it looked then....the killer was WHO? he wasnt introduced until the end of the book - i felt it was a poor ending and i was very disappointed when read who DUNIT! i can understand the reason Jennifer had to die but why Heath and where is Ben????? a lot of loose ends i thought. i am going to read another and thenmake my judgement of her as a writer it was nailbiting until the last 3 pages. Lucy seems like a whiney brat.
3 ||| Wilbur (voiced by Henry Gibson) is a porker with a problem: He was born the runt of the litter and to the farmer (John Stephenson), he's not worth the price of feed. The farmer's daughter Fern (Pamelyn Ferdin) steps in and raises Wilbur as a pet. Eventually the hapless curly-tail is sold to the Zuckerman Farm, where he meets an interesting assortment of characters: There's a rude ram (Dave Madden), a gabby goose (Agnes Moorehead), and a ravenous rat (Paul Lynde) named Templeton; but lonely Wilbur finds a true friend in the kindly, wise spider who lives in an upper corner of the pigpen. The spider is called Charlotte (Debbie Reynolds) and once she learns that sweet and shy Wilbur is in danger of becoming bacon bits, she spins the words "Some Pig!" in her web.Sweet story, soft and gentle animation, cleverly-written but sometimes annoying songs.Staci Layne WilsonAuthor ofAnimal Movies Guide
0 ||| I bought this book before Christmas 2011, believing I was buying the best version available. After receiving the book, it is good quality, but in no way "antique reproduction". It has the look and feel of any other kids book you would buy. I had great expectation about better paper stock and binding to make it feel more like a classic book (and reflect the price paid).I paid $120 for it, and now see that the price has gone up about 50%??? - and I feel like I way over paid.Don't be duped!Don't buy this item!I just found a website called [...] that actually shows antique versions of this book, and look nothing like this version.
0 ||| Can someone please explain to me the difference between modern "political correctness" and the disappearance of Trotsky from old Soviet photographs?I loved this show as a child. I wanted to buy it for my son.
2 ||| I read Cussler a lot. THis is the same old formula used for the 15th time. The formula goes like this: an ancient event that will have consequences in the future, undetroyable Pitt appearing by page forty or fifty ( in mass market paperback ). Then the rest of his pals ( GIordino, Rudi Gunn 0 appearing subsequently, an enemy as bad as Satan himself, the old romance with congresswomen Loren Smith, admiral James SAndecker, etc, etc. COnclusion: it's good.
3 ||| Charles C Mann is an excellent historian and author. The book is a wealth of knowledge. It's not a novel or page-turner but you will definitely have a pretty authentic idea of life during these times!
1 ||| My main comment is, if you want to be reading about tracing wood grains, you'll enjoy this book. You actually go through the pain of this tedious job. I really got the point at the first wood grain tracing session, but then there was another... and another...That's pretty much all I can remember about the story, seeing as I read it as a child. If you want to finish the series, as I always do no matter what, then you are in for some pain. Hey, if you finish it, you'll have the satisfaction of reading ALL the Ender books! Otherwise, forget it and read "Ender's Shadow", that's a masterpiece right there!
3 ||| This book was written by the author after he had experienced personal and professional losses. His position as an English teacher was eliminated. He decided to travel across the country staying on the "blue" highways and avoiding the super highways. This resulted in a fascinating narrative of his experiences in small towns reflecting the culture, introducing us to people and their stories. He discovers prejudices still active in parts of the south, rural towns that are struggling to survive. Most interesting to me were his conversations with local people and bartenders and waiters and cowboys. His description of the experiences of various Native American tribes and the impact on their lives reflects his knowledge and experience. His own adventures and sometimes near catastrophes add humor and suspense. Very good book. A classic!
0 ||| Chinese water torture? Sounds like a welcome diversion from this boring redundant work of "art" to me. I feel for the trees that were wasted in the process of creating this horrendously boring soap opera in paperback. It is possible that I missed something while reading this work because I spent most of the time trying to stay awake. However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime "soap". In conclusion, not only do I NOT recommend this novel, but I pledge to do my best to begin an anti-Persuasion League, to prevent the widespread development of narcolepsy in high school students who are forced to read worthlessly painful novels.
2 ||| While I'm not normally a fan of background music, I guess this Klaus Schulze album provided a decent enough listen. For the most part, I felt the songs were too long, and lacking enough interesting ideas. Some of the sound effects were rather upfront and annoying too. But there WAS also lots of softer and more relaxing parts that dominated the majority of the music. It was alright I guess, but not something I will ever purchase.
1 ||| I read the book a couple of years a go and I saw the movie a couple of weeks ago, they were both bad. The main thing that I remember from the book is that the main character urinates his pants non-stop. I found that the book dragged on and included too many nonimportant details. The movie was a made for TV movie that I watched in my American History class. The acting was horrible.
1 ||| It's a moderately good dance record with a couple of stand-out tracks. It's nowhere near as good or as ground-breaking as 'Everything Is Wrong'. It's sample overload. It's a unfocused. It works in places and not in others. It's 'clever'.If you're dipping a toe into the murky waters of dance music, and you want a 'safe' CD from a North American artist to play at dinner parties, buy this. It's better than Deep Forest or Vengaboys.But seriously, how is the Best of 99 list made up? Who decides? It's like a dance music equivalent of a rock list including The Eagles, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. All good acts ... but not in the running any more.
4 ||| I had read this book in hs, but totally had forgotten it. What a great reread! The book is so well written with the dialect of the time. The plot unwinds and twists so many times. It is very touching. Loved it!!
2 ||| The origonal story from the same writer of THE MALTESE FALCON----though this a very much 1970s tv show/mini-series, not some 1930s/40s poverty row movie.this five hour tv movie would have been a better 90 minute poverty row movie, with its murder story, religious cult, and drug addiction. james coburn sobering up in the cult's building, after being drugged, has none of the mood of the 40s MURDER MY SWEET similar drug scene.This is a very pre-MIAMI VICE looking movie, when all tv movies had lousy, banal, photography; this mini-series, set in the 20s, has the mood and photography of a typical contemporary 1970s cop show, or maybe a MASTERPIECE THEATER episode.The actor who would later play Data on STAR TREK has a small part opposite jean simmmons. And part of this mini-series was filmed in rural Pennsylvania.
4 ||| Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this supplier again. I will most likely order again.Thanks
1 ||| I looked forward eagerly after reading 5 star reviews of this book. I was supremely disappointed.The writing does not flow smoothly; it does not capture and hold my interest. The characters are not all that likeable.Nora does write well often, but not in this book. I was plain bored. I would like to see more books such as "Divine Evil", or "Homeport".
0 ||| Found another file box just as good with out the handle for only $8.00 instead of the amount Advantus. Returned the box
4 ||| Loved this book and have given it as a gift. My friends, a couple who are both engineers with their own firm, found it to be the answer. Too many times after a long day they would dine out because it was just too much trouble to go home and cook a good meal and they wanted to relax over dinner. They cook on the weekends now and they say the recipes are delicious and not a bite was wasted. They will freeze smaller portions now because recipes are large. This book fills the bill for people who love to cook but have busy lives and would like to eat delicious meals at home more often. It doesn't pretend to be a way to save money although the items are generally easy to find and grouping the menus as the author has does make efficient use of time and ingredients considering the terrific meals produced. Not for everyone but an outstanding book.
2 ||| Though the text has some good discussion of the writing process and useful exercises, the authors tend to set down at times questionable "rules" and much too much advice. The price is also out of line for most students in public universities and colleges, especially adult education students who want to write as a means of personal enrichment--and it is the latter type of student rather than the next Hemingway or Frost who is most likely to register for a creative writing courrse.
2 ||| This is a great toy, also in the poogle racing game on level three, it is not impossible to win (some other person said it was) you just have to press... nah I'm not going to tell. figure it out yourself. I myself have a krawk. I've earned the rare item code from the games but neopets could really make sure they put in a correct code. I tried entering mine but the warehouse keeper said "sorry this neopet does not belong to you". Basicly this means this code is WRONG. So if your code works (from the game, not from the card) your really lucky. Don't be surprised if it doesn't though.oh yeah, I tell you the secret for the L.3 racing. When it counts down 3.2.1 Then it will say "Go!" you can't move know but start pressing the buttons now. REALLY fast . try to stay somewhere in the lead because if two of the players pass you... well... it IS practicly impossible.
0 ||| This book was The Dragonriders, LOTR, and HArry Potter in one. Even the names arent original, the Hero of destiny: LOTR, Aragorn, Eragon, Eragon, the Elf mistresss, LOTR, Arwen, Eragon, Arya, the evil foot soldiers: LOTR: Uruks/Orcs, Eragon, Urguls: The Wizard: LOTR, Gandalf, Eragon,Brom, The evil speacalist: LOTR, Nazgul, Eragon, Rozack, LOTR: Mordor, Eragon: Morzan, the list goes on and on. The character development is the same, and the nations are exact: both have dwarves who have shut themselves from the world, and a love story between a man and an elf, shaky alliances between the evil foot soldiers and the evil empire. And the spells all resemble that of Harry Potter. This book is ok but if u want a real adventure story thats original read all of Tolkiens books.
1 ||| Clearly, Joyce's work is a tour de force, an everyman's epic day hidden in grand literary style. The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you. But for the everyday reader, who reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'
0 ||| Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there.
1 ||| This cd is trash, im not tryin 2 be a hata, but they got like 2 good tracks on the whole joint. The beats an production is pretty good, but the rhymes are jus horrible. I mean they were ok with pac, cuz they kinda complimented his style, but now there jus a pain 2 listen 2
0 ||| This was my first Grsham and I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and it was plain to see why the jurors were being eliminated. Maybe I should give his early books a try but so far I am not impressed.
3 ||| I love the size of the cubes but it is inconvenient to have to stop and slide the tops back. Wish I had ordered a differend kind.
0 ||| Well I have been waiting a couple of months to receive this book. and have yet to do so. I am hopping I can contact the seller soon so I can finally get it. But we'll just have to see. Very disappointed in not getting this book yet :(
0 ||| Dear all,I received this Ultraviolet Man Liquid Metal Summer by Paco Rabanne and I was very disappointed. It is a fake product. The bar code was replaced by another one. Someone cut out the original barcode. I used it and after 30 minutes I could not smell the perfume anymore. Terrible product I want my money back.
0 ||| It did not work out of the box and technical support was of no help at all. It's a great price but doesn't save you anything if you can't get help.
3 ||| I bought this book while going on a kick of learning about Wicca. It was the most informative and easy read of all the books that I got a hold of. Although I am not a practicing Wiccan, I kept this book for furture reference.This book goes into some history, the basis of witchcraft, and how to cast spells. Cabot explains how to use Wicca in every day life, which some I use: placing crystals to enhance energy, etc. She also touches upon enhancing your own psychic energy. It was truly a good read, even for those just wanting to learn more about the religion but not to practice. Would work well as a simple reference too.
3 ||| Klosterman takes a look at society while using pop culture. It's funny, interesting look at society in relation to popular culture. I found myself actually agreeing with his points in many of the essays.
1 ||| this book spends too much time on history and stories. beginners need to know how to determine the temperature of the oven. advanced cooks may know how many coals to put on and under but charcoal is better to learn with.twelve chapters of history and differances of cast iron and aluminum is too drawn out. the final blow is when there are only 19 recipes and most do not appeal to me.
0 ||| I would rate this a zero if that were an option. This CD is a travesty in the truest sense of the word. This is advertised as greatest hits of Webber's music, but there is nothing of the original feeling of Webber's music on this CD. Though they may have talent for other music, the makers of this CD totally miss the mark in translating Webber's music. Selection #4 is a particular mockery with its techno-translation of the piece. There are many other options available with quality recordings of Webber's music. Do not buy this CD!!!
1 ||| Make sure you read the description carefully before ordering so you're getting what you really want. This particular pillow cannot be used with heat, unlike the sinus pillow which works both hot or cold.
4 ||| I love the quality of this product. The leather bottom adds more cushion that helps me to feel good about the protection of my lens.
4 ||| I offer the following advice. Read Ulysses while listening to the Donnelly, Healy-Louie narrated audio-book. Other reviewers suggested reading aloud, which is good advice, but this excellent audio version of the book will greatly improve your reading experience and understanding.
0 ||| This stop watch has a big screen, but no on/off switch, so you have to remove the battery to turn it off. It worked for a few days and then died for no apparent reason. I had to send it back. I would not recomment it at all.
2 ||| I have to say this album didn't WOW me. I didn't like it when it came out and I don't like it now. I love Banarama, don't get me wrong. There are good tracks on here. All of the good one's were released as singles. So best just to pick up the Best Of collection. Stike It Rich is a great track just too long. This CD came on the heals of True Confessions. With that album they tried to go in more of a serious direction probably because of Siobhan. This time it just feels like they were trying too hard to capture what they had before.It sounds overproduced. Siobhan soon jumped ship after this one. I look forward to their latest release "Drama." It has a few updated versions of some Banana classics! Siobahn's latest single is called Bad Blood. It's amazing!
2 ||| After seeing the first two Anne of Green Gables films, I couldn't believe how wonderful they were.I plan to see this last part of the trilogy, but i would like to first just say several things...1.) Keep in perspective that the first two Annes were made in 1985 and 1986. I was shocked to see that the last part was produced in the year 2000. Only a few short years ago!!!!2.) The actors are older~~~ALOT OLDER!!!!! Some have unfortunately passed on...not a good thing!!! So you're going to see alot of differences in nearly 15 years. The magic may not be the same!3.) For the lady who has written her own sequel, go to sullivansboutique.com, and there is the site of the man who directed, and produced it. It's a Canadian site, and you may get the address of how to contact them from there. Good Luck!!!
2 ||| So I didn't think I had sensitive skin, but obviously I do because this thing left nasty blisters and whelps all over my midsection and sides.It really does suck everything in and give you a great hourglass figure, but now I have these huge, horrible scars. Maybe I will try to wear it again in the future with an undershirt or something under it, but for now these scars are very discouraging.
4 ||| I first read The Hobbit in Elementry school. Ever since then it has been my favorite book. It is a tale of fantastic adventure and is told exceptionally well by the author J.R.R. Tolkien. This book is for young and old. It is a magnificent piece of work and it shall be cherished for ever.
1 ||| Surely you have seen or at least heard of Clint Eastwood's "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly?" Well "The Hours" would more appropriately be titled "The Insane, the Unhappy, and the Confused." Yes it was beautifully filmed. Yes it was well acted. But what is the point? Oh, by the halfway mark I had consumed 2.5 bourbons so maybe I missed the point. If you are male, stay away. And if you have a wife or girlfriend, keep her away from it.
4 ||| I highly recommend this book. I read it before my son was born, took it to the hospital with me (and used it), and referred to it repeatedly during many months of successful nursing.
2 ||| Almost everyone will find something to like about this film, but other parts can really get your knickers in a twist.Despite having heard the tune for years previously, I didn't really like "Unchained Melody" until it was featured in the movie. There are many surprises here...Demi's unusually convincing performance, Whoopi telling us about traffic patterns in the spirit world ("I got spooks comin' in from Jersey!"), Swayze developing his telekinetic powers with the help of the "subway ghost". Yet there is also Whoopi's annoying ad lib attempts at humor, the uninspired "afterlife" special effects, and the uncomfortable subtext of the plot...that Demi loves the Swayze character even more now that he's deceased (shudder). The theologically inclined will get to weigh in on how the court system in the afterlife would rule on a "revenge killing" plea. Hey, and if this necrophiliac spook-infested romp really is a good movie for Valentine's Day, heaven help us all!
3 ||| If you are interested in camping, this book has great information about things that will smooth out the rough edges. Worth the read.
0 ||| When i first heard his single "One Wish" i thought this is a good tune, but then he got to the second verse, i thought eh? This guy cant sing! later on his album came along, his vocals destroy his tracks, literally. Comparing him to other artists such as Mario or 112, you'll realize that he can't sing, full stop. Disappointing.
3 ||| Okay, so for the skeptics, I will try to keep this short and to the point. I am in the process of using this product. I did not get it from Amazon, I got it at a local CVS. I was looking for the Freeze stuff (I was totally in the dark about wart remover things) and saw that they cost upwards of 16 or more dollars. I decided to go with the stick instead. I have been using it for a few weeks. I applied it to a wart that has been on my finger for a while now, and after maybe a week it started to peel off. I.was.a.mazed. I would rub the edge of the stick around the wart to try to keep it from getting all over my finger (since the wart is fairly small). This has kept the peeling down to a minimum on my good skin. I have let it dry for a while to allow my skin some heal time, but I will continue treatment this week. It really does work (so far, to an extent).
2 ||| Going into this movie I figured it would be a Bush bashing film. I was wrong. It was actually very balanced and an interesting look into the former president's life. His hard drinking days up until when he quit drinking (age 40), was an eye opener and almost disturbing at times. Another head shaker was his father (George Sr.) bailing "Junior" out of one mess after another and the film depicting George W. as a perpetual party animal, time waster and unable to stay gainfully employed until he stopped his boozing. It is a worthwhile watch. BnB Beatles Depot
0 ||| I really don't care what anyone says. I could not finish this movie. It was horrible. I was forced into renting it because we had to do this Cyrano de Bergerac/Roxanne compare/contrast sheet for French. I am unhappy that I had to shell out three bucks to rent a movie I never even really wanted to see. The fact that it was a bad movie didn't help the situation.Steve Martin may think he's being clever, but really he isn't. I absolutely hated his charcter, who, despite his big nose, was awfully cocky. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of the real Cyrano de Bergerac, so that MAY be part of the problem. Nevertheless, the plot made me roll my eyes and every bit of the movie bored me to tears. Please try to find something that is actually witty and funny, like The Simpsons. The Simpsons knows how to paraody literature.
0 ||| After reading reviews about every small wine cellar offered through Amazon, I ordered this item, hoping it would work. It arrived damaged. The cellar was sent UPS in just its original box, no extra packing to protect it. The plastic around the door was cracked. The door was also hanging at an angle. I actually considered keeping it even with the damage so I plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer. No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot. It arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine.
4 ||| ...and Considering Kate was no exception. Kate Kimball is returning home. She's opening a dance school in an old building which is sorely in need of renovation. Lucky for her Brody O'Connell is around to help her out. While he's renovating her studio, she sets to work renovating his heart.I loved Kate. She's a forthright, determined woman with a capacity for love that can't help but win over Brody and his son, Jack. Considering Kate is a fantastic read, and a great opportunity to revisit the cast of favorite past characters!
1 ||| I bought 3 sheet sets, I have noticed on the two queen size sheets that the stitching that holds the elastic in has come apart in several places and the elastic is now falling out. I have only washed these sets two times. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
2 ||| This product is good if you know you've been exposed and use it exactly as directed. It is used to clean all the ivy oil from your skin. If used correctly when a rash first appears, the rash usually doesn't get worse but it is no good for the itching.
3 ||| Well, the story of the Princess Bride was wonderful! It was such an amusing plotline, interesting characters, such humour and wit, and I suspect Morgenstern was quite brilliant with the political savvy behind it all. But I just really enjoyed the cover story. However, from the little bits and pieces I could distinguish there was some interesting parts that Mr. Goldman left out. I understand he did us all a favour by cutting out all that rabble about Florinese royalty and humour, but when he casually adds that he cut out Westley's history and reasons why Max was cast out... that was irritating. I felt the Princess Bride was enchanting, but Mr. Goldman used the book more as an ego trip. He did more talking about himself, and his life, and all his griefs, and how HE personally made his son into the successful hunk he now is. Hmm. If there was less Mr. Goldman, and just the Princess Bride, I would have appreciated the book more.
3 ||| This is really great stuff. I recall Pat being interviewed in the past few years and saying that he thought that this CD wasn't that much different from his music now, only the underlying rhythms. I feel that this disc is a must for a couple of reasons. The first and most obvious reason is that it is a fantastic recording of Jaco Pastorious. I think this is one of his finest works. The second reason, and I think that many might miss this if they don't have the historical context, is that being Pat's first solo project it was a turn in the musical road that seemed filled with fusionaires. Pat sort of began to hint at his compositional genius. His playing is great and the recording really breathes.
2 ||| This book was OK, but totally not one of my faves. This book is about Claudia and Alan. Claudia really likes the way Alan is right now, but something is missing in him...could it be his humor? Is Alan trying too hard to impress Claudia? to find out, read this book!
0 ||| My experience is like a lot of others - I bought this unit with high expectations for good performance but found that it would regularly freeze up my machine. When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well. Additionally, the installation manual had erroneous information in it. Ask yourself what kind of company would put out an untested product like this and still forge ahead with a clear conscience, and that just about sums up D-Link. I would recommend LinkSys or any other vendor until D-Link improves the quality, dependability, and reliability of their products.
2 ||| I thought that this CD would be just another Britney Spears wanna-be CD were the singer just tries to act all innocent and cute. But I was wrong. This CD actually is a solid CD with great beats and songs stemming from various backgrounds. Definately a good buy.
1 ||| I thought that these tweezers were ultra sharp...perhaps a little too sharp. Even when I got the hair perfectly... the tweezers would act like scissors and cut it leaving little hair left for me to grab. It's more than a little frustrating. I also found that mine aren't perfectly aligned so even when I'm right on top of a hair it wont' grab it because the point is so specific. I think this tool is perfect to dig down to your ingrown hair and try to bring it above your skin surface and then use another pair of tweezers to actually pull it.
0 ||| My co-workers and I decided to watch this during a slow day at work. Judging by the cover, one is led to think...."Horror Movie" At first the errie atmosphere seems promising. As it drags on you realise it's meant to be a thriller and by the end of the movie it's safe to say homicide has been commited. That's right, this film just killed over an hour of your precious life that could've been spent doing something actually enjoyable. Nope, it's gone right down the toilet so to speak. This movie has one of the most dull endings I've ever seen, it's just a really bad, BAD MOVIE! Please heed my advice and walk away, otherwise, consider yourself warned.
0 ||| When I purchased this movie, I was under the impression that any film with Adam Sandler would fulfill my entertainment desires. Alas, i was highly mortified by the extremely horrifying display on my television set. The film was not only dark and disturbing, but the soundtrack was erratic, irritating, and a failed attempt at being artistic. This film is a tragedy; a complete insult to socially inept people. The only positive in this situation, is that Adam Sandler was able to emerge from this film with his career still intact. Please reconsider purchasing (or even simply viewing) this film. If you still feel the need to purchase a new DVD (I myself am an avid film collector), I suggest Old School (starring Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell). Now THAT is a fine film.
0 ||| At first glance this ring looks like no other. Ever since then, however, it has been nothing but a horrible mess. The tarnish free has tarnished! All of the stones lose their shine! Everything gets caught in the inside of the ring because it is practically hollow. If it even skims something it scratches. All in all nothing but a piece of junk!
0 ||| I ordered a branded product, Griptex, made in the USA. We've used the product for years and still have wrapping from some of it. The ad says, "Griptex" but what we got says "wonderliner", made in china. The name Griptex does not appear on the product or it's packaging. We consider this to be a bait & switch. Bad Amazon! This is the second time this kind of thing has happened. Some people don't mind sending their money to a communist country; we're not part of that crowd. Truth in advertising is essential in successful business.
4 ||| I have 3 girls and they looked beautiful in their matching dresses for Christmas!! I have washed them since then and they held up wonderfully!
4 ||| This is an awesome resource for homeschooling. My boys finished (and LOVED) Story of the World. We have been searching for a new curriculum... and finally found it. They LOVE this!!My boys are in 6th grade. It has options for kids of all ages and abilities. It is wonderful.
3 ||| I concur with the gentleman who says that if you want to learn to program XML - this is not the book you want. As a manager making product programming decisions, I needed a book to: (1) help me understand what XML is against the context of all the other internet enabling languages, (2) how it relates to EDI data exchange, and (3) where it is applicable. This book hit each one of these areas on the head for me. It's already been borrowed by two other managers who work with me who are trying to get up to speed also.No matter what anyone else says, this book was 100% on target for what I was looking for and I now have a clearer understanding and can talk the topic. My thanks to the author.
1 ||| I walked out of this film with nothing, no sense of exhilaration (like one gets with good action sequences), no warmth, as with a great story that you just learned about, there were some good visuals, and the audio was strong (you felt a chill from the rain and wind from THX) - but that was by far the highlight.I laugh when I read the reviews from Big Name reviewers that say such great things about this film. I guess politics in Film reviewing is no different than any other politics - people will say what they need to when the perks / or $ is good enough. (Hell, if our President is doing it - why shouldn't a movie reviewer).
2 ||| The album is well recorded, but the songs on the album are not going to be familiar to very many people. I like to listen to Jerry sing songs that he has made popular or that were done by another artist. I just do not find this an album that I like listening to. Suggest ordering a different Jerry Vale album.
3 ||| I usually read the book first, but I had seen the move "Practical Magic" and thought it was terrible, so I had no desire to read the book. It kind of fell in my lap one day, though, and I thought I would give it a chance. So glad I did! Walker's writing is absolutely beautiful, and she really can create a mood and an image through her use of words. There is none of the hokey, aww-how-cute stuff that marred the movie so badly, and I found the characters much more believable and human. I also liked that Sally's children were older and had a bigger part in the story. There is magic in the store, but it's much more subtle and the aunts actually do resemble an old-time "cunning woman" or village witch. I highly recommend this book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is for the ending; it wraps up a little too neatly, and I felt that some of the characters behaved in an unrealistic way.
1 ||| The original batman with the Joker as the villian, staring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, was a great movie. It was a shock to me, who had only seen the later sequels and Batman Begins. I enjoyed Forever a lot more than most people. Val Kilmer was great, and so was Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey. Truthfully, I loved Batman and Robin. Arnold and Uma played the best Batman villians to date, and George Clooney was a good Batman.Batman Returns is actually the last one I watched, and I have to say it isn't that good. Danny Devito as the Penquin is good, but Michelle Phiefer sucked (Halle Berry was better) as Catwoman. On top of that, the plot of this movie (Of Penquin becoming major) is unrealistic, silly, and would never happen with excessive force. Also, Batman doesn't have many lines. All he seems to be a brick and stop the enemies; that's it.This the weakest Batman Movie. Why anybody thinks this is better than the next two is beyond me.
0 ||| just how do the two differ?same number of discs (including the original bonus disc).same running time.same extras.no sale.unless, of course, a&e; has somehow obtained the RE-re-mastered complete first season from network (uk). that'd be HUGE and i'd pick it up in a heartbeat, but sadly, i see absolutely no indication of that (to date, anyway).
1 ||| This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say "I burn bookee". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it.
1 ||| This is probably the worst CD Sawyer Brown has ever came out with. Out of the 11 songs, only about 4 are worth listening to. I recommend you listen to it before you waste any of your hard earned cash on this.
0 ||| This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone.
0 ||| This DVD requires access to the internet if you are attempting to view the movie on a computer with a DVD-Rom drive. Presumably this is to download something from the internet to make the experience "more enjoyable"?!? I have attempted to contact Fox about this problem and was told it isn't a problem to them. Consider yourselfwarned.
4 ||| I was very pleased with my book. it was delivered fast, and the packaging was done right. I look forward to doing business with you again.Thank You
0 ||| The lid from the smallest sauce pan was missing. I called and asked if they could send the missing piece. Instead of making it simple, they said I'd have to send the whole thing back to them. Because of this, I asked for a refund. The pans themselves also don't look nearly as good as they do in the photo. The lesson here is to not buy items like this online. Your best bet is going to a store and seeing what you are going to buy in person beforehand. Also, if you run into any problems, it's less of a hassle to take care of.
3 ||| Both poetic and thrilling, the best thing about this novel in the texture: the language and visual imagery are both stunning. This is a wonderful take on a twisted childhood, and so it's no surpirise Terry Gilliam will direct the movie version: the surreal and dreamy misprision is right up his alley. One might quibble that the voice of the narrator in the novel would be beyond that of a child, but the payoff of the reading experience is probably worth the suspension of disbelief.
3 ||| It IS a true tale and a lot of the detail is correct - till about half way through when an "Irish spy" arrives in the UK on behalf of the Germans. Not needed in the real world story - the twist is needed to add some tension at the end of the film.Clifton Webb acts like Clifton Webb - that is to say like a plank of wood! However for the period it is well done.Spot the pennant number on a Castle Class frigate in the background of one scene and then go and watch "The Cruel Sea". Guess the Admiralty "lent" the British cinema the same ship in more than one movie!Topical (early 2008) because as of late the identiy of the "body" used in the real war has become subject of fresh debate.
1 ||| A wise man told me years ago that the reason the Church banned so much operatic music at Mass was not that it was distracting, but because it was so bad.I find this selection to reinforce that judgment. Sorry that I bought it, and sorry that I looked forward to hearing it. I would give it away if I knew someone that I disliked that much.
3 ||| This is Jack Reed's well-written but highly partisan and pro-Bolshevik eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution. Reed's Soviet Socialist biases drip from every page like an oily coating, and this may irritate readers who are not quite so utopian as was Reed. TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD is all but useless as an objective history of the event, but it is extraordinarily useful as a subjective interpretation of the birth of the first Communist state, and therefore, it is an interesting, fascinating, and valuable document well worth reading.
4 ||| In only the form that Tolkien can give, we find that the Fellowship has all but split apart, where frodo and sam head of towards Mordor, while Strider and the others go off to save pippin and merry from a horrible death.The books takes the reader more in depth, emotionally and otherwise, with the main characters. We find that the fellowship has only been split up physically. Everyone is starting to find the strength in themselves to go on and fight for what they believe in even if it spells out their own death.This book is another reason why Tolkien is one of the best writers of his generation. A very moving book.
3 ||| This movie may not be as uproariously funny as the original but it does seem to have more to say. Instead of being about a bunch of guys trying to get laid, this movie, at times, explores becoming an adult after high school. It's a fitting compliment to the first without trying to outdo it which would have been nearly impossible.
3 ||| This was a disc that I knew would be unique. Other people make this disc out to be no good, but as you can see, these ar HOME recordings and Elvis did not have to be at the mercy of the record producer. This disc is laid back and easy on the ears.It is one disc I amproud to add to my collection.
3 ||| I just finished reading this dark masterpiece by Burgess and I have to say it was pretty good and I'm probably gonna read it again.Alex is one of the most confused charachters ever printed(like De Niro in Taxi Driver)and I hated it when he beat people and raped women but I felt sorry when everyone beat the carp out of him later. Anyway this is a pretty good book and highly reccomended!(I'm really 14!)
2 ||| The watch in itself is a good one, however, do not try to depend on it in the dark. Personally, the light function on a watch is very important to me so that's why I gave this 3 stars. Everything else on the watch works great especially for the price: $12.00. If not having a light doesnt bother you, this is a major steal at this price. For me, its rather disappointing. I never knew how often I used the light until I got one that didnt have it.
1 ||| The only track I really like on this one is "Left Side Drive", which is reminiscent of their older work. Why "Dayvan Cowboy" is issued again is beyond me, since it already was totally redundant on "The Campfire Headphase". To top that, the remix is even worse than the original.The rest of the album contains mildly interesting noise-drenched synth noodlings, somewhat sounding like their earlier work, but mostly lacking its emotional power.I keep hoping that the Boards will get their act together, but it hasn't happened yet with this EP. Only one decent track out of six is hardly worth it.
4 ||| I read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again.My order was handled quickly and professionally.Great service. Great book.
0 ||| I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm really not an Asian-movie person. I just don't "get" them, and I'm sure it's a cultural thing. "Tampopo," "Crouching Tiger," "In the Realm of the Senses" and now this one -- I couldn't sit through any of them. Unless you are a martial arts or samurai fanatic, or a big lover of Japanese culture and history, I would say definitely skip this -- especially if you are female. I think this is one of those "Emperor's New Movies" that we're all supposed to like, and no one will admit to NOT liking it for fear of being thought ignorant!
2 ||| Le Tigre is a feminist, quasi-lesbian band that uses sparse, minimalist techno to prove their point. In order to enjoy, you must be willing to hear the lyrics screamed and shouted. Maybe the members will go on to bigger and better things with a broader based appeal.
4 ||| Mostly biographical vignettes of a motley assortment of eccentrics and crazy characters. Author has remarkable powers of observation and description. Darkly humorous and addictive fun reading!
2 ||| The book was entertaining and heartfelt. I gave only three stars because I feel very strongly about overpopulation being a global epidemic. Still it is worh reading.
4 ||| I was really surprised by the full and balanced response of these sport headphones. These are a very good alternative to ear buds when working out. Helping with the low end are 16mm drivers using Neodymium magnets. These are way beyond most ear buds and much better than my old Sony sport headphones for bass response. They seem very efficient and are easily driven by my MD player.These also fold into a small bundle that can be wrapped with the cord. They're water resistant too.If you are frustrated with buzzy ear buds that come loose as you sweat, try these. Well worth $20.
3 ||| This strainer is perfect for small jobs around the kitchen (I use it for draining freshly squeezed lemon juice. While it seemed a bit pricey, it's strong construction and reinforced edges make it the perfect kitchen tool!
4 ||| Just want to say that it's great to finally have my favorite part of the star trek legacy available in DVD format with the extra features. I have been a fan of (TOS) (TNG) (DS9), as well as the feature length movies, and can say this is one of my favorite installments, so in general i am just saying Good job
1 ||| Well, I was looking for a book to help me out with Freehand 9, not to mention how to incorporate it with Flash. This was not the best of books. No offense, if you're a print person, then this will be a good book to have. If you work on web and multimedia, then this book is not what you're looking for. It's well written, but not much help to what I was looking for.
0 ||| As a man, I bought this book to help me try to understand how women think. This book scared me. The author seems to have a narrow idea of what men are. I found it sexist and almost racist. Women that read and follow the guidelines of this book will only find men that the author describes. Selfish and lazy. I was going to give this book to Goodwill, but I think that I will burn it instead.
1 ||| THis product looked nothing like the picture. It was very small and did not sparkle. I had to purchase other earrings, instead.
3 ||| toby lightman performed for the vocal students at my school and and it was juss her and the guitar and it sounded 10 times better than the cd!!!!!! it really showed her beautiful voice....nonetheless her cd is very inspiring i really love it and i love the fact that she writes her stuff..she is a true talent and i hope she comes out wit an acoustic cd in the future...she is also a very nice person she was really cool to all us and answerd questions 2...i hope later on fame doesn't get 2 heR!
1 ||| Clancy obviously has different constraints nowadays like publishers to satisfy, etc. As a result he is having to move with the times especially with the end of the Cold War being witnessed. His usual attention to detail is obviously missing. Some may argue why worry about such trivialities (e.g. the VC.20B that Clark and Chavez use to fly from Canada to the U.K. is not a Gulfstream 4 but a G3!. In the U.K. we talk about a draw in Football - Soccer, not ties!) but things like this should be easily verified and was the thing that won him many fans in the first place. This is a good book and easy to read but when compared to the very high standards that he set early on this one falls well short. It will appeal to the masses who aren't quite so discriminating.
2 ||| Not a bad book, although one would expect something more at the end. Only question is who is the real hero this time. When bullets fly, McNab is the hero, but when keyboards work overtime, someone else should get the appropriate credit. Come on, mr. McNab, you of all people should know that SigSauer pistols DO NOT HAVE SAFETY LEVERS! It takes just a little detail like this to give away the game... Anyway, not a bad book, not bad at all.
4 ||| This is an excellent book. Easy to read and motivates you. My mother in law and sister in law are following it and are very happy with the results.
0 ||| McDougall must be the most egocentric, pompous MD I've ever read. His diet NEVER fails, only YOU fail at it.
4 ||| OH' MY GOODNESS--THE BIG BUGS WERE SOOOO AWESOME I COULDN'T HANDLE IT--ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WERE OVER 18 HOURS OF GIANT STUPID BUGS!
3 ||| You need to understand that you are not listening to Booker T. & the MGs. No Booker T. Jones, no Steve Cropper on the album. This brings a different feel to the recording but nevertheless a nice one. One track, "Breezy," should have been the title - it sums up the album perfectly. None of the songs made me jump up and take notice (like "Green Onions," "Hang 'Em High," or "Time Is Tight") but when the CD is over, I'm still glad I listened to it.
2 ||| Dlink operating systems are very bad, they seem to be developed by complicated designers and programmers, always a lot of bugs so you need new firmware to avoid half of the bugs.They devices work but you need a lot of hours dedicated to understand their OS. So if you are not an IT expert, do not buy them.
0 ||| As other reviewers have noted, this is a ground-breaking, hilarious, one-of-a-kind movie. It deserves to be in everyone's DVD collection, even if your collection consists of but two DVDs. It deserves five, even six, stars, but...I urge you to wait for another DVD version, for two reasons: first, if ever a film deserved extras, it's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, but we get none on this over-priced DVD. Second, the movie is trimmed by a scant few seconds (on grounds of poor taste in the offending scenes), but the critical thing is -- It IS censored. Strike a small blow for the ability to decide for yourself, and avoid this DVD. Wait -- it'll show up in an unadulterated version at some point in the near future.
3 ||| This is just Five Faces Of Darkness, the five part third season premier from the original Transformers TV show. If you grew up back then, like me, then you should have already seen this yourself back in the day. If you didn't, or you're new to G1 shows, this is ok but not essential to your enjoying The Transformers: The Movie. The F.H.E. Video of these episodes has been available for rent at my local ... for years & years. Since it's not likely to be available here, check your ... or, better yet, go to ..., check out the CTLP and get your episodes on VHS from one of the many video traders/sellers who have many if not all G1 episodes on tape. That's what I did for the episodes I wanted that haven't been released by Rhino Video yet.
0 ||| This was a complete waste of money. It does not hold a charge for more than a couple of seconds.
4 ||| Even though I'm a senior citizen I still enjoy and take pride in my ability to stay abreast of the times. I have an iPhone 4 and love the different things I can do with my 'Smart Phone'. Besides being a fantastic phone, I can also check my mail, look up something on the internet, check my accounts at the bank, download hundreds of applications and as a personal little satisfaction-- I downloaded 'Treasure Island' to re-read on my Kindle app...
2 ||| "The House on Haunted Hill" is one of the those older horror movies that relies more on the creeking of doors and shadows to get results with its viewers. Unlike, the horror movies of today which are mostly just gore fests. This was more of a comedy, actually, just because the effects and some of the writing was so hoky.Still, it stars Vincent Price who is the owner of the House on the haunted hill, and he is in his true zone of acting in it. He is mostly known for movies like this.The effects and props for the "scary" scenes were more funny than anything, but it's the scenes where you hear a door creeking or those moments where you wonder what's on the other side of that curtain that really make you jump.At just over an hour, this is a great movie to watch during the month of Halloween. It is even good for older children.
0 ||| this movie wasn't scary at all, except seeing how old the women look just 5 years out of college. there was one 'reunion' shot where there were some like 60 year old women, luckily they didn't show their breasts. plus, enough with the strangulation, horror movies don't have stranglers dressed like ninjas. i actually checked this out from the library and found myself wondering who does the movie selection for them. i probably would have liked it if i'd seen it on skinemax when i was like 15.
1 ||| After spending part of my summer vaction reading Chaim Potok's novel The Chosen, I felt that I learned more about the Jewish religion, but I was also a little disappointed. The Chosen is a novel of two Jewish boys growing up under different Jewish customs in the 1940's. Reuven Malter, the main character in the book is an Orthodox Jew, and Danny Saunders, the other boy is Hasidic. Since the two are different in religious ways, Danny being more serious about his beliefs, and Reuven being more relaxed, there is a lot of tension between the two at first, but they get around that and evolve to become best friends. I felt disappointed after reading this because I expected much more. It has wonderful reviews, so I expected non-stop excitement. At times the book was fun to read and interesting, but most of the time it was rather monotonous.I give this book two of five stars.
3 ||| Very good history of Lincoln's war years. Some of more recent books are more interesting reading.
1 ||| In my mind, "Ferment" is this band's masterpiece and Wishville does nothing to further their legacy. I've listened to these tracks several times, trying to pluck something noteworthy from a bunch of truly uninspiring songs. Only "Mad Dog" caught my interest, and that's not saying much. Maybe they should hang it up and move on.Avoid this one unless you are a diehard fan.
1 ||| Out of all the songs on the CD only the very first one was one I enjoyed. The rest were just junk as far as I'm concerned. Of course, this is just my personal taste.I loved the movie, and for some reason I remembered more beautiful songs and music scores than what were on this CD. I would have been better off to have found that one song and just paid to download it...bypassing the rest.
3 ||| These are great suppliments. I have never heard this brand before. But, now I take 1-2 AFTER my workout. They seem to help in joint and muscle ache and fatique.
0 ||| I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson. I FULLY admit my mistake; I thought it was a DVD version not a VHS. Immediately after I hit the purchase button, I caught my error. At that moment, (not more than 1 minute after purchase) I sent an email explaining that I was sorry but I didn't want the item. I sent a total of THREE requests to please cancel the order. I didn't receive a single response from them. My VHS version of Robin Hood came in the mail and the money was deducted from my account. The VHS tape is still sitting on my dresser in the original mailing box, in the wrapper and of no use to me. I will NEVER purchase again from godsnet and would STRONGLY recommend others not to. I made a mistake yes, and would not be leaving a negative response if they would have just contacted me. No response at all makes me question the ethics of this company. RED FLAGS are up for a reason.
4 ||| Occasionally I will read a book that causes me to chuckle out loud once or twice. This book made me laugh out loud so often my roommates started worrying about me. The comic relief aside, a masterpiece.
1 ||| We first got this grill 3 years ago (may 08). At the time the legs were stable the cooking temp could reach 500-600 without difficulty. By the next summer the legs started getting weak. The liner under the lid needed constant cleaning and most importantly the temp would barely break 450. Then last summer came along and the grill just refused to get hot. I took apart the heating element and was aghast at what I saw. The entire encasement was one big blob of plastic. The whole thing was melted to pieces. You would think the designers wouldn't use plastic so close to the heat! I will not buy a replacement part or buy a new grill until I hear that charbroil has addressed these issues.
0 ||| Marilyn Manson should get into film making.His themes and imagery are mind blowing especially on this latest album.For that reason it gets a star.It is his best art work yet!However his music has reached a dead end.This album is his last two albums revisited.It is less melodic but the dynamics are the same as is the vocal delivery.Lyrically there are some clever ideas but it borders on contrivance.Although Bowie has covered the Berlin period and the flirtations with Nazism MM takes it to another level but still, special effects and creative production can not disguise sub standard songwriting.Music should essentially be about good songs.Theatrics are secondary.Give me Torniquet,Coma white or The Nobodies any day.
2 ||| The way that long lines end is a little confusing at first, and makes reading with a group somewhat awkward, but for the price this is a great book.
2 ||| The Giver is about a boy named Jonas and he lives in a community where other people pick there jobs and wife's/husbands and clothes. Jonas job is the Giver and a Giver helps people and the community. A Giver also has special powers and great minds.I would recommend this book because it's very interesting and it kind of pulls you in to read and read longer. This book is also kind of sad because people die. Not only is this book interesting and sad, but sometimes in the book something pops up and it's always surprising or important.
3 ||| Well I'm biased because my cusin is in this movie. He dances with madonna in the bar sceen.. But I still think that it's a good movie.
0 ||| looks cool. Key word people "looks" cool, it isn't bullet proof, please don't think it is, or that pockets make you look the part.
2 ||| I love this book. We read it as a family this year. We read about a chapter a day. It brings a good feeling into our home when we read it together.If you Love the Savior, Jesus Christ, you will enjoy every page of this book. If you believe the Bible to be the word of God you will enjoy this book.Read it fast or read it slow you will be thankful that you took the time. If you have the agency to choose what you do then you should use it to give this great book a read.
3 ||| For me, this book probably ranks right about in the middle between King's best and worst books. It's entertaining, and you can get into the characters, but I guess the book is more of a "downer" than most of his. I won't say and spoil it for anybody.As far as the audiobook goes, the reader takes a little getting used to. He reads in kind of this matter-of-fact "Mr Rogers Neighborhood" kind of voice, which at first seems really odd given the subject matter. Eventually you get used to it though, and it's not so bad.
1 ||| They have already quit working. I had them resting on my knee and they fell to the floor less than two feet. They have not worked since. I could understand if they had been dropped repeatedly, but I would have expected more from Sony.
0 ||| I ordered the book for a friend, another professor, but Amazon shipped it UPS with signature required. UPS left two stickers on my door while I was at work and I never got the book.Why not USP--the US Post? A paperback book with value of $17 does not need to be shipped and handled like opium or gold. If UPS, why signature?Bottom line, it was returned to Amazon, I ate the shipping charges, and bought the book at my local Barnes & Noble. End of review.Great book, BTW. I'm teaching it next term. But the university will do a brokered order through Bowker and students will pay a 40% mark-up, I suppose. Who's getting rich on this racket?--Dan Bentley-Baker
3 ||| I was hesitant about this movie, but man it was too funny, I was laughing so hard I was crying! I found it completely worth it! Way to go Jenny M.!
0 ||| you gave the wrong bag to me,it donot fit in the camera.i am very disappointed.Please do not repeat this with any other customer atleast.thanks
0 ||| I bought 2 Breezaire 4000 units thru Beverage Factory and while the fist worked for 5 years, the second never worked and after back-and-forth for over a year with Breezaire Service without getting it fixed, I found myself no longer covered by the one year warranty and having to pay to ship and repair a $1,100 product that never worked. Eventually, I gave up and threw it out. The dump is too good for this piece of junk. Beverage Factory was useless, not standing by a product they sold and just passing me on the Breezaire Service.
1 ||| I did not enjoy enough this CD since it has a lot of explanations and very few vocal exercises.
1 ||| We thought that the 2008 date meant it was a recent production. It looks like an old VHS that has been transferred to DVD. It was a dull presentation. We're donating it to the library.
4 ||| Like most OXO products, this is a bit more expensive than other options, but also a bit better quality than other options. I like the rounded end and the way this helps join the brush to the pan. Works well.
3 ||| works as expected and of nice quality well worth price others were more expensive but funtionality of this is good
3 ||| I first heard this disk on vinyl when my college roommate pulled it out from his stack of twelve records.I immediately loved George's flash and in-your-face playing style. After all these years I still do.This disc has one of George's best track lists, including "Who Do You Love?" (popularized by many commercials--Sam Adams beer the most recent); George's signature Rock & Roll version of Hank Williams' (Senior) Country and Western classic 'Move it on Over'; the story-with-a-moral 'Cocaine Blues'; and another George favorite, 'Baby, Let's Set a Date'.This is also one of the better-recorded Thorogood recordings and is enthusiastically recommended for newbies and oldies alike.
3 ||| First off let me say that of course theis wasn't as good as the first Dune nothing ever would be.-But that doesn't mean it's not woth reading. If every book you have to read has to be a masterpice like Dune!-The charector development was good i loved seeing the problems Paul Artrdies actions, and how he is disgued with what he created, It was overal, avery short but good read, and i highly recomend it to anyone who liked the first book.
0 ||| Vin Diesel is confirming his status as the Steven Segal of the 21st century. This movie is a hot mess!! Vin is supposed to be an hunted anti-hero in this sequel to the hit "Pitch Black". He's a former prisoner caught between warring forces in an all-galaxy mega-battle led by the powerful Necromongers. Vin learns about his mysterious origins (he's the last of his breed) and faces off against the leader of the Necromongers with the future of all beings hanging in the balance. Whatever!! Anyway, this movie feels like its 5 hours long. Its an overheated and over-rated spectacle. Go see it if you must, but you have been warned.
3 ||| Congo is an exciting read. Michael Crichton takes you on a perplexing adventure into the depths of the Congo jungle, where few human eyes have gazed. Truly suspenseful.
0 ||| To Michael Franco who wrote "IF IT WAS MADE IN THE FIFTIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASTERPIECE", that is definetely not true. In fact I suggest you watch the 1952 movie, which has much more believable special effects than this movie has. The '50s movie is still watchable today and stands miles from this garbage.
4 ||| Item arrived in timely fashion. It was described as "like new", and it looked like it just came off of a store shelf. I am very pleased.
2 ||| Another meh. Really about as serious and developed as some of the classic tunes offered by High School Musical, but since these guys might be out of high school (?) it's marginally better, or at least I can take it without wanting to fight someone. It's just throwaway pop, but that has its place, so after sampling a bit online I bagged it- shallow as it is, at least they're more original than the light hiphop schplack pervading my airwaves these days. Good for 12 listens, then it hit my shelf. I forgot I had it until I dug into my Amazon Purchase record and saw I never reviewed it.
0 ||| I purchased this watch in April 2007 for my wife, who needed a stylish dual-time zone watch. Unfortunately, one of the clocks stopped working accurately within 1 month, and the other stopped entirely within 3 months. A watchmaker identified the problem as defective watch movements (not batteries, water or abuse). It is a disgrace that a company charging over $100 for a watch can't put in the same quality mass-produced Japanese movement that one gets in a $10 watch elsewhere (and which costs less than $1 wholesale). What good is style if the watch can't tell the time?
1 ||| Not impressed, slow moving and not a plot I was happy to watch. Expected something more exciting, but fell far short in my opinion.
1 ||| This magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away. I was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside, but the articles are very short and pointless. It was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they don't know what their doing.
1 ||| The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie "Clueless". However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person.
3 ||| This is great to have -- my four year old now marvels at the fact that his hand once was so small. It's a great present but may be a better gift for parents who likes to stay on top of things. It turns out to be a waste when parents forget to do it every year.
4 ||| I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young.
3 ||| Well, I beg to differ with the Amazon reviews. The thing that makes this extra creepy is that our young, uncertain heiress fully believes she can trust her new husband. As a matter of survival and love, she finds it impossible to believe any cruelty of him; it is less painful for her to accept her own insanity. The black and white media is used well here, and surely inspired Hitchcock.......
0 ||| What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work
2 ||| Director William Cameron Menzies, set designer for "Gone with the Wind" and the original "Invaders from Mars" (1953, which he also directed), keeps this modest Civil War story moving along nicely and with sufficient human-interest details. Guy Madison (TV's "Wild Bill Hickock") and James Craig are close friends who end up on the North and South sides, respectively, and who, not surprisingly, must fight one another in the movie's final reels, though they do so out of sight to one another. Come to think of it, we only see them together some two or three minutes at the start of this reasonably exciting B-epic that belies its budget, courtesy of Menzie's set designs, in spite of harsh early-fifties color and a less than liberal budget. Nothing profound, but this notable picture does convey some of the tragedy of friends and loved ones torn apart by the most horribly personal war in our history.
4 ||| This was just what I wanted.......a clog type shoe without holes. Very strudy. I usually wear an 8 1/2....ordered a 9 and they fit well.
4 ||| I bought a set of these several years ago. My only regret is that I didn't by more than two pairs. I literally use these on every project. The get a good gripping force and they are very handy.
0 ||| "Seven" deals with two police officers (played by thespians Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) who are trying to track down and bring to justice a killer, except this is no ordinary killer. It is belief of the killer that he was sent through divine inspiration to put to death anyone in violation of the seven deadly sins.
2 ||| I tried the toothpaste BEFORE trying to get the toothbrush in his mouth. He sniffed and turned away. The toothpaste MUST be tasty if you don't want your dog to hate having his teeth brushed. The brush is a good size for a pup or small dog, but feels a bit too stiff. Because of this, I cannot recommend this kit.
3 ||| The fire pit has been a nice addition to my patio during the december chill. It's used frequently and appears to be holding up well. My only problem is the screen appears to weaken when used during the fire and becomes mis-shapen. it is also starting to rust. All in all a good investment for the use it's getting.
1 ||| I can't believe it took him five years to write that. All fluff and very little story. I was so looking forward to this book, now I am not so eager to see the next one.
