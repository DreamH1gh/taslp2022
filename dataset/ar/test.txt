4 ||| The format of the movie is very intriguing, the plot plays backwards, and you don't find the motivation for any of the characters' actions until after each scene plays out.This is one of those movies that leave you questioning what really happened; in fact, even more so, because the main character himself has to question what really happened since he can't remember!
1 ||| I read this for a book club. I went away for a weekend and read it in 24 hours. Paradise is about isolation. Are you interested in isolation? I was. I have never read anything else by Morrison, but I may after this.
3 ||| There are a few sentences in which Benson could have written better, for example: "Fility habit." Bond said to the unconsious man. It is obvious that Bond had been speaking to the man, who else could it be? It could be change to "Bond shooked his head" or simply "Bond sighed" Nevertheless, I still think the plot is good.
1 ||| This is a mostly terrible collection of re-recorded hits. Find compilations of original recodings and you'll be much happier.
2 ||| The watch works fine but the band is wider than I expected so it is not as comfortable as is would like and it looks a bit clunky but it is easy to read and set. The blue is VERY blue so it is has a very sporty feel and less of an everyday look.
3 ||| This is a very entertaining, albeit pretty short (170pgs) book and I would recommend it to anyone that likes survival type stories.Only problem is that now I don't think the movie will be anything near how good the book was.
0 ||| I returned the CD because it didn't play. The seller ImportCDs gave me instructions for returning the CD, which I followed. When I questioned them as to why they didn't return my money, they demanded a confirmation number which I didn't have because they didn't tell me I needed to return the CD registered mail. They never refunded my money.
2 ||| I picked up this book soley on recommendation of a friend and when I saw that it'd been given excellent reviews here on amazon, was expecting a grand novel. Instead, I found myself extremely irritated by Katherine and her weak demeanour and low self esteem. She's everything that as a woman, I strive not to be, so I had absolutely no respect for her or the story.
4 ||| We have two of these seats (one for my 4 year old that we've had for about 2 years, and one that we just bought for my 2 year old). We LOVE these boosters! They do not slide off the chair too easily, they are a great height, very comfortable (according to my kids), and they clean easily. AND...considering we've had one for 2 years already with very few signs of wear, I give it an A+ for durability!You won't regret purchasing this - and your kids will love it!
0 ||| I'm sorry to have to write a negative comment, but the Brother co. deserves it. Most of the bad reviews above are true. I will add one more: it is a pain to print envelopes with this printer, IF you can print them at all. I visited the Brother website to get help with the issue, but no luck, Their suggestions did not fix the problem. The stories about the ink cartridges are true, as well as the constant self-cleaning. I did like the fax/scanner capabilities, but I will never buy a Brother product again.Sorry Brother, you should have fixed the problem before putting this thing out there.
2 ||| I picked this book up after reading Jack Kerouacs 'On the road', but I must say that I'm pretty disappointed. It has some brigth sides, a sometimes laugh-out-loud humor, surreal characters that just makes you wonder if he was high all through the project, a language that absolutely won't disappoint you (pretty hard to follow though). But there's just no story to tell. I haven't read the whole book, and I'm not sure I'll do that. It's bizarre, weird and I don't understand how someone just 'gets it', because I didn't.The guy's probably a genius - a word-genius anyway - and I think that's just the problem. No normal intellectual person can understand his unfinished ideas and thoughts. It's just the cocain speaking...
1 ||| Undeniably, great special effects. Unfortunately not sufficient to make a good movie. The story line is poor, linear, and barely compares to the Star Trek universe. This version is more like space cowboys. I am a The Next Generation fan. In TNG, Captain Picard is constantly faced with situations that require a discerning and strategic approach, combining smarts, negotiation, creativity, tactical maneuvers, not just the boring "let's blow them up with a bunch of proton torpidos". Zachari Quinto (Spock) is the only excellent actor in this mascarade.
0 ||| I have to disagree with [a] reviewer , as this film deserves every bit of scorn heaped upon it and then some. Pity the poor cast as they try to maintain the illusion that the ghoulish, octagenerian Ms. West is some kind of a sex symbol. Run for ear plugs as she and Mr. Dalton mutilate "Love will keep us together" (not the best song to begin with but it deserves better than this). Recoil in horror as the reanimated corpse of Mae West spouts sexual innuendos that were stale 60 years before this film was made!Of course, even without Ms. West dottering around the set this movie would be unwatchable. The screenplay is dreck and it was seemingly directed by Helen Keller.I watched this movie on a dare, and I'm convinced that God has knocked some time of my upcoming sentence in Purgatory because of it. Unless horrifically bad movies are your hobby this is to be avoided like the plague.
2 ||| The author presents a tour of cyberspace. During this journey, we learn how the author feels, and what their priorities are. Cyber communites are the logical extension of chat sites, and web/ mail exchanges. In the real world, where restrictions can be placed on our daily lives, virtual reality provides an escape. Exploring this venue, we can learn more about ourselves as we interact with others, and the new environment. I'm glad the author documented their experiences!
0 ||| I watched it this weekend and it was slow. I finished it because I don't like to see half a movie. But really, it was like watching Ground Hog Day without the Humor.
2 ||| I was told this is an excellent book but did not find it to be that great. The second half was more interesting than the first half. I think what I liked least about it was the author's writing style. To me it seemed plain and boring. I have read so many books that I could not put down but this was not one of them. It was not a bad book - I was able to finish it with no problem - but it certainly was not great in my opinion.
3 ||| Ricky Fant√© sure knows how to strike the pose, how to fraze it, how to make it sound like it did back when Volt/Stax was the hottest sound around, but he lacks the depth, it's like he forgot to share himself, it's almost to perfect, just the emotional depth missing, it's close but no cigar.It should have been 3,5 stars, but still if anyone finds the way back to the originals, I'd gladly give it 4 stars.We can just hope and pray that Ricky gets swept away on the next album, he sure knows how to carry a tune...But unlike Otis and C;o it's not for real, it's a pose, a well executed one, but still just a pose...
2 ||| even on the lowest setting, the fan is quite loud. powerful, sure, but a lower setting would have been appreciated. it's not a good model, as it's too large for a desk, but too small otherwise.
0 ||| When this thing worked, it worked out ok...I've definitely heard better quality out of cables but hey...you get what you pay for.However, it stopped working after only a couple of weeks.How many stars does a cable get when it can't supply it's basic function for more than two weeks?One.
1 ||| There wasn't the typical depth to the characters that I'm used to from Ms Roberts. I have loved almost every other book I've read that she has written, so this was a disappointment. I'm glad I didn't pay that much for it. It had a decent story line, and it moved along at a decent pace, but again, the characters just weren't up to par. I understand that this is a reprint of a book written in the 80's, and you can tell how well Ms Roberts has evolved in her writing technique.
1 ||| I agree with many of the other people who have reviewed this book. Although some of the information is helpful, the tone of the book is very preachy and condescending. I invariably become offended every time I read more than a few pages of this book.
2 ||| I think I might have gotten a defective punch. It works okay on thin paper that you would use in your printer - but give it anything thicker and it will tear rather than cut. If you buy this punch I suggest you test it right away on different types of paper so if it is defective you can return it. The punch I have also has a tendency to jam and remain stuck in the down position.
0 ||| If you believe that books are a great way for your children to learn good English grammar, then this book is not for you. The author fails to use the subjunctive and writes, "I wish I was" instead of the correct, "I wish I were", several times in the story. Shame on the author and the publisher for dumbing down the English. Just because this is accepted in popular culture is no excuse for writing in such a way. It is disappointing because the story is lovely.
2 ||| I like the game. It is somewhat challenging, and I like that. The only real problem I have with the game is the fact that you I have the freedom that I have in other similar games. You have to choose a chasis (you cannot design one), and everything goes into predetermined places. What I mean is, although there are a wide variety of weapons, you can only place them in one of two places.But it is a challenging game, and a fun one to play. Even with the almost pre-fab feel, I do enjoy playing it. I only regret that I cannot build a replica of my bots from the other game. I would love to attempt to rip the plating off of the house bots with it.
3 ||| I really enjoy listening to David Sedaris and consequently I really enjoy this book-on-CD, however, I find that the collection of stories -- while varied -- are not as uniformly funny as found in DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM, which I find much more uniformly funny. That said, there's quite a few gems on ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY! A must for any Sedaris fan.
4 ||| Love the book, i'm not a very big vampire fan but steakley brings a great story. The heroes are tormented and afraid but still fight on. they got the backing of the catholic church and god but they'll need more than that to survey great book. buy it and read it you'll not be disapointed.
2 ||| Possibly it is my copy. Possibly it is my blu ray player. In my opinion, stay away from blu rays made in Mexico. Quality is poor
4 ||| I love this movie. It is so funny and romantic. Meg Ryan is awesome in this movie, she is so cute, you can't help just feel like your in her shoes or something. She really rocks in this movie. Kevin Kline, you fall in love with his personality. He pulls off a great French accent. Also, he is hilarious. Everytime I watch this movie, I just feel like I want to go to France. Great job, worth every penny. Get it, it's worth it.
2 ||| Ok, so I saw the preview for the movie with the same name. I'm not quite sure what to think about this. I can tell this is no ROCKY right off the bat. Really, come on. This is a book based off of a true story, that they are NOW making into a movie. So...why didn't we just leave it at ROCKY. He had all those things, did it WAY before, and had a cool name.They are lucky I SAW the preview. If I had heard about it, well... I just don't know what I would think. As I said before, only in boxing could a name like "Cinderella Man" be considered tough. Later.howardtuttleman.com
2 ||| As one of the previous reviewers have already stated, this book promises more than it delivers. However, it does cover in detail what happened in June, 1941. Stalin was deceived by Hitler and the Germans even though it was well known that those 185 divisions sitting on the Russian border were not there for the climate. The information was so well known that at least a dozen sources issued the alarm before the invasion actually occurred. The author does a good job detailing the state of Stalin's mind and why he was deceived. Both Stalin and Hitler had a healthy respect for each other.This is an OK read about a fascinating event. The German invasion could have turned the pages of history, but other events (Japanese actions) actually sealed Hitler's fate. The author is a respected historian and offers some new insight on some minor details.
3 ||| How else do you explain someone who tries to pass off another's insightful and intelligent writing as their own? i also read that er...'review' on pitchfork a week ago. He must think amazon's customers are stupid. I can copy and paste too! The album is tremendous however...
0 ||| This movie has been compared to masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoire Dogs. The question is why? Chopper does contain explicit gore scens such as ear mutilations and shootings. Apart from the violence, Chopper lacks the humor and masterful direction from Tarantino's classic works. In addition, the acting is substandard and the plot quite simple and boring.This movie has been hyped up to be the biggest thing out of Australia for years but Chopper disappoints on all levels except the DVD transfer which is tolerable.If you want to see an Australian classic, watch Roadwarrior; Mad Max 2 and stay away from Chopper, which is one stinking DVD, which reeks of cheap production and lame acting.
2 ||| This is a good, but under whelming movie.The plot is somewhat predictable.Good acting, but nothing out of the ordinary.
4 ||| I purchased this and have it on my desk to play with when my computer is super slow. This is very, very addicting. People often stop by to play with the supermags.I wanted to play with this instead of working. The pieces are super tough, the log pieces can be stepped on, dropped, put under heavy books and they don't crack.Be careful using this around computers and other objects. They are strong and will literally fly out of your hand if there is something metal nearby. I recommend keeping the pieces in the Styrofoam container in which they came - the top can be turned over and used as a play table so not to lose the pieces.I plan on getting several more sets for home as well as an additional set for my desk.
3 ||| As a long time fan of Oasis and there previous albums, I must say that this CD took me by surprise. After reading all the bad reviews and bad comments made about the CD, I was happily surprised to fine that this CD is really GOOD! I wouldn't call it there best effort, however, by no means is it as bad as some people have made it out to be. Tracks such as "Go Let It Out" and "Little James" are reminisent of the Oasis of old. While tracks like "Who Feels Love?" allows the listener to hear a new side of the group. The only reason this CD didn't receive 5 stars was because the CD has a real "Noel influence" deficency. However, Liam does a good job picking up the slack. P.S. The bonus track on the 2nd CD "Let's All Make Believe" is one of Oasis best songs ever.
2 ||| I have owned two pairs of these headphones and the sound is superlative. However, I would like them to last more than a year. Both pairs suddenly died on me, the most recent today (I'm shopping around Amazon for a new pair and thought I'd review what I had).The headphones do everything the manufacturer says they do. Outside sound is all but nonexistant while wearing these...a real marvel. The sound bears mentioning again. It's that extaordinary. Very natural sounding.Two pairs dying on me, while I'm being extremely careful in handling them, is unacceptable to me.
2 ||| I read this book in high school and didn't like it at first because it was a little tough for me and the attempts to get off the island seemed to drag on to the point where I no longer cared if they got off the island at all but then I read it again and seemed to like it. It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as "beasts" I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it.
4 ||| This story takes place around the 1860's Leighton Buzzard,Bedford Shire in Great-AuntSophy's manor, in the kitchen under the floorboards. That's where most the story takes place.This book is mostly about the Clock Family Pod (father), Homily (mother), and Arrietty (daughter). A boy, "Human Beans" as they say (a human boy).In my opinion I liked this book a lot because of all the fiction and fantasy.I would recommend this book because it's fictional a lot of fantasy and at the end it makes you eager to find out what happens after the book has come to it's end. If you like fiction and fantasy this is a great book to read!!
2 ||| I dig the songs but the lyrics for the most part are angry or hurt feelings, almost like he doesnt want to be happy. This feels like break up music at times and then the he sprinkles a few happier songs. Could be just me, but give it a shot.
3 ||| This is a recording by a very great orchestra, conducted by a top-notch conductor, and featuring a very good recording. Why is it so reasonably priced? It is a live recording(complete with applause at the end) and has a couple of moments where the orchestra stumbles a little, one or two overly loud timpani strikes, and lots of plainly adible coughing from the audience. It really wouldn't have been fair to charge big dollars for it, I suppose, but I almost would have paid it. I have lots of 9ths and especially from the third movement on, this is right up there with the best of them. Very musical, wonderful singing, heartfelt and rich without being grandiose, the last movement gets 5 stars.
0 ||| I don't know who gave high rating for this crap, maybe producer friends?!? Keep your money. Except two minutes near the end this is a very cheap movie.
3 ||| I seriously do not know why the people who have reviewed this product have had so many problems with this VCR. I've had mine since last January and have had no problems with it at all. While there's no denying the fact that it is loud, and that the unit is pretty light, this VCR, in my opinion, is pretty close to top of the line. It has good sound and the picture quality is great. The VCRplus+ is also really easy to use too. Just punch in a few numbers and it's ready to go. I also like the remote too. Even though the light feature only illuminates the play, stop, rew., and f.f. buttons, it's just the right size, and it has a very strong sensor (I can hold the remote about 1/2 inch away from a wall, facing the opposite direction, and it still gets a full signal. It's that good.). There's also some other nice features, but I won't get into that. Overall, if you want a nice VCR at a low price, you shouldn't have to look much further than the V4611.
2 ||| If you did yourself a favor and researched the plotline to this movie and saw how it related to the other movies then you wouldn't be pissed off you spent your money for nothing. Derp. Its still a good wholesome movie for the family, i haven't read the books but i still wouldn't care, its still good acting. Stop bitterly complaining before you scare other people off from getting this movie. Shame on all of you.
0 ||| I read this book when I was at a friend's house; I was attracted by the title, but dissappointed by the content. If you have common sense, nothing in this book will be news to you, and not all of the advice is good. The book also fails to treat men as individuals, as the author seems to think that the same tactics will work on all males. Being a male myself, I can assure you that this approach is erroneous. Better communication with your partner will do far more than this silly tome ever could.
2 ||| Some history of different styles is included which I found interesting. This book looses a lot since the photographs were omitted. Written from historical upper class perspective.
3 ||| The Wahl 4000 electric razor I purchased through Amazon comes with 3 shaving screens. I have been using the one for the closest shave. It has been comfortable to use and closer shaving than the Norelco I was using before. I have been very pleased with the results.My only disappointment has been with the side trimmer (for use with trimming side burns, etc.) It is not easy to use without pulling hair. And it is not as effective in trimming as other razors I have had.If you don't need the side trimmer, this razor is the best I have ever had -- more like a "blade-close shave" than any other razor I have owned.
4 ||| This was my "first" exposure to RENT so I had nothing to compare it to.I absolutely fell in love with the movie and all of the characters especially Tracie Thoms! I have all of my friends and family addicted to the movie now. I am now officially a RENT HEAD! I am so sad that I missed an entire decade of RENT. I loved the overall theme of the movie which for me was simply, LOVE, TRUE FRIENDSHIPS AND FAMILY! Tracie Thoms was so convincing in her role, it was so moving, I have cried every time, especially on the cemetary scene. I thought that everyone did an excellent job. It is so funny because, my favorite songs change from week to week and my favorite character changes from week to week;but, Tracie Thoms is my all time favorite! I was one of the people who paid the $20 to see the final stage performance at the movie theatre and I will be attending the stage performance in my city next month. TAKE A CHANGE ON THIS ONE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
4 ||| I love this mat! High quality for an inexpensive price. I ordered the light blue, and it's actually a little darker than pictured. Not by much, though. Not a big deal. The thickness is perfect for my bony dinosaur spine. Perfect comfort. The thickness didn't throw my balance off at all. I would definitely buy this product again.
2 ||| I didn't expect too much out of this movie. But it was actually funnier than I thought it would be. I'm not at all a Ben Stiller fan, but he was pretty funny in this. I can't believe how much the girl in this movie, looks like Marcia from the Brady bunch! The resemblance is unbelievable! It's good for a few laughs. Definitely not a movie for young kids.
0 ||| Stay away from all the crap zeze e luciano done...It's all the same nulity, some of the worst you can get from the music industry! It's so lame and ridiculous...JUST LOOK AT THE ALBUM FRONT COVER!!!!UNBELIAVABLE, but sad but true!
4 ||| Samurai and the Tea was not only historically accurate but kept my interest from beginning to end. Cathy Brueggemann Beil has an extraordinary talent for writing! After reading the book myself I am now reading it to my children. What an incredible way to learn about the beautiful legacy of the Japanese Christians! I look forward to her next book!
2 ||| MacAlister is an excellent author covering a unique subjet(dragons, etc.) extremely well. This is a good read. Purchase it. This book will hold you over till the next Aisling Grey comes out.(buy her other books) Though, simply put it is not as fantastic as You Slay Me(really her best work to date).
2 ||| Very interesting book. Gives a good overview of the Homeland Security status and effectively illustrates the futile efforts to protect everything ultimately protects nothing. Also good effort describing the "shark feed" of vendors sopping up billions in tax dollars by trotting out dubious products and services to address Homeland Security. The book diverges in Chapter 9 Electronic Pearl Harbor where it is written more for an Information Technology type.
4 ||| I am a Civil War reenactor, and this book has been an excellent source of ideas for first person scenarios and ideas for living history. It is an insightful, unique record of the soldier's life for living historians or students of history. I would highly recommend this engaging book.
0 ||| this book was one of the worst books I ever read it had no point at all. I would defintly never read it again
4 ||| I use these in making paint thickness gauges. The price is great, quality is very good; does exactly what it should! I will be buying these again!
1 ||| I bought a used copy of this book at %30 discount, and I still think it was not worth the money.The book is very hard to read, the author puts his personal opinions all over the place very frequently and presents them as facts. Moreover, the content is also all over the place, on one page you are reading about the deep details of IP address formats, a few pages later you encounter the author's opinion about the way oriental people work, and then you read about why so-and-so project failed in 1970s, etc.Most of the bits and pieces of information are related to Chicago Merchantile exchange. The book is full of acronyms, you need to go to the index page at the end of the book to figure out what they mean, yet the explanations in the index sometimes lead to even further confusion.I work in the finance industry, developing trading applications. In my opinion, there are a whole lot of other books that you can better use your time on.
3 ||| This movie is very acurate but does drag in certain places. The director does a very fine job of re-creating the battles. I am a Civil War enthusiat but not all consumed by the war and found this movie to be worth my while. I recomend you play the directors comments at the end of the movie...very interesting.
0 ||| so i should go into depth on this. many of those "hated this cd" reviews are longwinded crap themselves, so i'm gonna try to make this interesting to you,my eleven year old trying to break away from his parents friend.now many of these dudes on here bash greenday, but i like them. theyre good. they came out with dookie, and now they've matured big deal. simple plan will never mature, they'll die thirteen and bitching. blink 182 i dont like. but they still at least try to grasp fans over 12 with there greedy paws.simple plan is good and dandy and fun if youve had a brain anurism. they wanna b punk, and give them a pat on the head and the finger for their troubles.good luck.
2 ||| They seem along with J.K. Rowling seem to be turning these sequels out at record rate.Magic is fun for kids?From the UFO stuff in the 60' through 80's I realize that what seems "harmless" funto the more intelligent can be a trap for the less preceptiveand simple?Sure, I like these movies and seeing the characters grow upon the screen, but the problems of this being a sort of modern Buck Rogersserial of full length movies is one that we will have to deal with down the road.I just saw the last one out on dvd over Christmasand the villain's personality is split into 7 parts:each of which it seems will be killed in froth coming books and movies.That plot device will keep this going past 2017 and make Rowlingas rich as the Beatles?
1 ||| William Queen presents a straightforward and compelling look at life within the most violent outlaw motorcycle gang in the United States. I found the most disturbing thing to be the movement of the gang across the United States, establishing locations in areas where local police have no experience dealing with them. Seeing the gang from the inside is a revealing and eye-opening story.
1 ||| Even more so than the previous versions of MS self study kits, this one heavily relies on readers to research things on their own. Also double check the "correct" answers in the practice exams they are not always so correct.
0 ||| This is a waste of money. We have been giving it to our maltese every morning in her food for a month now and it has not done anything for her tear stains. The only active ingredient is 100% beef liver and beef liver does not remove or prevent tear stains. Save your money.
2 ||| Sadly for many fans of Ben Affleck, this movie that supposed to be a great drama and portraid the irony of life, it got affected by the bad publicity made on Ben and Jlo, and the flop that Gigli became, although I still dunno if Gigli was good or bad cos I haven't seen it. This movie it's an average one, the story is balnd and without a continuos plot. Ok he became unnemployed, he work with his father and had a supposed romance with Liv's character, but every lil' aspect presented in this movie it's hard to be connected, anyway, the best things about this movie are the acting, every actor does well in that matter, but the plot just don't make any connection between one scene and another, although the best scenes are the fight between Ben's and his daughter, and the Video Store scene....great....but after all it's not a movie that I'll watch agian sorry....only if is on cable....hihihi....***THREE STARS
3 ||| This is a much more rock-influenced CD than Robbie's previous work. That said, fans of sophisticated pop will also love this CD. The first 10 songs on the album are accessible to new Robbie Williams fans, while the remaining songs fall back on his more eclectic, tongue-in-cheek, British style and might take several listens before becoming palatable. "Me and My Monkey" is the low point of the album. "Feel", "Sexed Up", and "Love Somebody" are particularly strong tracks.
1 ||| It was a good story line, but the leding lady was just weak. She just couldn't make up her mind, yes she was sick but why did she not want him there for her. I just disliked her alot. I was happy to put the book down.
3 ||| I read this book about 5 years ago at JNU, New Delhi and found it to be very good at historical analysis of culure and narratives, especially seen from a women's point of view. I also liked the way it focussed on literary "genres"--and their role in the politics of conduct. I recommend it to those interested in cultural analysis, feminism, historicism, and narratology.
0 ||| God this album is progressive. Some of the songs go over 5 minutes long and I love it. It's not crappy like Opeth or Dream Theater but it's awesome. Man what beautiful guitars. I'm an experienced guitarist who still can't play this stuff quickly. Forget Opeth or Dream Theater, Angels and Airwaves rules!That was more sarcasm. Angels and Airwaves try to be progressive but fail misreably and can't compete with Opeth or Dream Theater.
4 ||| i would have to say that i know that this book is really true. you have to really want to know of its truthfulness in order to have the promise at the very end. those who say it is not true doesn't really know anything. people who dig up old civilizations on the american continent are sure that they are not just put there by some prankster. so is the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith did not have enough education- only at a 3rd grade level. He was not able to know much, and have the ability to make things up as some claim. and this book is not written by Joseph Smith- he just translated it.
1 ||| You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
4 ||| This is my second UDY perfume... I just love the perfume.. One of the best perfumes I ever used. Comes in a nice girly pack as well.
2 ||| I bought this book some years ago following a rave recommendation, and the title really grabbed my attention. Once I got home to start reading it, I got the black smudges all over my fingers, and the really poor quality of print made it close to impossible to concentrate on the reading. I managed to get through some 50+ pages but just couldn't finish the book. I tried two or three times, to covercome this problem, but the paper color was quite brownish, and I just gave up in the end. I realized I couldn't give this book to any of my friends, and had to let it go. The one memorable part of the book was something about Ugly Duckling, and "unmothered mothers" theme.Also the written quality of the book is such that it is quite chatty and repetitive. I think I might've preferred a condensed version of this book. Just my two cents. Thanks.
2 ||| Given how much I'd heard about this book, I was surprised at how little it had to offer. Yes, he does tie together some important ideas about how civilizations develop, but the author is clear from the start that the purpose of the book is to argue that poverty is not the fault of the impoverished, and wealth isn't a reflection on the merits of the wealthy. This is a point that he returns to so often that it becomes tiresome. Any explanation of historical development that actually looks at the qualities of the players involved rather than at their good or bad fortune is dismissed offhandedly. This is a political commitment that requires him to overplay factors in human development like geography. The book is worth reading, but largely to show how academic presuppositions can get in the way of good research.
1 ||| I bought these based on the reviews and the price. Big mistake. I only get 6 hrs of "dry" time before my little one soaks through his clothes and leaves a big wet spot on the bed.
4 ||| I bought two for our twins. So far I am thrilled. The installed very easily for read facing and also very easily for forward facing. The babies are now 12 months old and I wonder if they will really fit in them until they are 3 or 4, but the sales person insists they will. So far we are deilghted with these seats.
0 ||| Despite the product description online AND as stated on the box cover, this dvd does NOT include the theatrical release. Only the extended director's cut is included.
3 ||| The front storage pocket is just big enough to carry a couple of extra AA batteries. The camera fits snugly inside but is easy to remove for use.
3 ||| Look it, JL = r.i.p, GH = r.i.p JPM = r.i.p since he was killid beyond recognition in a carcrash in 1966, so that only lives RS.too bad really?
2 ||| As I write this in Mid-January of 04, there is little info available at Amazon's page for this item.It is important that potential buyers know that this item is labled as a 'usb' kvm switch. What Iogear means by this is that you plug a monitor cable and a usb cable into each computer, then plug your monitor and PS2 mouse and keyboard into the kvm.I bought this item supposing that I would be able to plug in my USB mouse and keyboard.Otherwise this might be and excellent KVM switch. Unfortunately I had to put a rating on this review so I placed a 3 with my kvm UNOPENED as it does not suit my needs.I hope this helps.
1 ||| i borrowed this CD from someone, listened to 4 songs, and gave it right back. the lyrics are ok, but otherwise this cd has nothing. the music is AWFUL, the voices (other than JC) are pathetic, and the whole thing is blah. Every song sounds like the others and it gets worse- do these guys know about ANYTHING other than breaking up with girls? And how can people say these guys are even even remotely cute? ugh... If only we're lucky enough, this "pop life"- or at least N*Sync- will be gone soon. At least they're not 16...they'll be too old pretty soon (case in point Debbie- uh, Deborah- Gibson). the cd itself isn't worth the cost.
2 ||| Chris sounds like he's shouting at you for most of this album. The vocals lack power because of the lack of contrasting, quieter moments. For power, witness "My Morning Song" from the Southern Harmony album to hear the bands raw power and dynamic range. Musically, BYS is not that interesting or throw-down funky, either. Marc Ford is greatly missed. Southern Harmony was their best all-around album, IMO. Every track raises the ante, My Morning Song clears the table, and Time Will Tell sends you on your way. Amorica is fantastic, though burdened by a couple of mediocre tracks (Cursed Diamond, p.25 London). By Your Side still shines with Virtue and Vice, however.
4 ||| I bought these to make raised panel shutters for the front of my house. They worked out great. I was able to reconfigure the bits to work for my needs considering that the shutters are only one sided. Expensive but very high quality. Nice case too.
4 ||| This information is probably the best practical approach to understanding the problems with relationships yet offered.Someone told me a long time ago..."people do things for their own reasons"...this information causes you to look practically and take the time to investigate how your spouse or girlfriend may be seeing things from her perspective...until you at least become aware of this fact of life, you'll never really understand why others do what they do....great stuff...I listen to it over and over again as I travel in my business activities...it can apply to any relationship....even your relationship with God.
4 ||| You want to see your almost every day car on your every day roads going as fast as they can.Than try this video and you'll be hook,you won't believe your eyes.And all this in a video made like a television serie,where each race adds up to the championship,you won't be able to live your t.v for two hour.I almost have every year of the FIA World rally Championship videos,i want them all because it's the best racing acting there is.
1 ||| No special features at all, on either disc, just the movie. Not at all what I expected from a Blu Ray/DVD combo pack.
4 ||| This is my personal favorite Slayer album.Although not as fast throughout as Reign in blood.Its a more three dimensional piece of work than Reign.Songs like Silent scream and ghosts of war are a natural evolution of the Reign in blood sound.The slower side of Slayer is just as much a part of their sound as the fast material.Lombardo's drumming is amazing on here.His double bass and lighting fast rolls on Silent Scream are truly a clinic in extreme drumming.This may not be the heaviest Slayer album but its the darkest and most unique.
3 ||| I LOVE this set !! But.......I have had two copies of this Match Game DVD set....and find portions of the discs defective and unreadable on my DVD players...I have four different brands. Check out Disc Four....the 1962 Pilot.....anyone else having problems watching this...?
1 ||| Nice style and appearance. Pretty god quality for price/package, good speakers. However some internal problems. You need to place it uphigh good clear view toward front edge of shelf- recieveer location on it for the remote signal is poor. I need a 2x2 inch block under front to elevate it to recieve remote signal. Programming it setting the time and radio stations/channels. Decent not greatest- but get used to doing this. It loses the time very frequently on me (and why unknown, no power outage nothing else in house needs reset). When time lost, mixed as to if it also loses station memory- not alway sbut frequent.
4 ||| In this book 4 kids wonder off in to a nother world threw there wardrobe. They meet alot of strange and unusual characters on there journey. En evil witch turnes alot of the characters in to stone and the kids help get them back. This book isnt realy like any of the books i've read befor. It seems more like a kids book with all of the crazy characters but, people of all ages could enjoy this book.On page 12 of the book, the quote,"How stupid of me! But Ive never seen a son of Adam or a doughter of Eve befor." This quote kind of lets you know that there are not many humans in Narnia. They refered to humans as sons and, doughters of Adam and, Eve. this book also shows you that even though they are animals they can still talk in english. This is a good book if you like books with unusual characters in it but, i you like serious, or realistic books this is not for you.
0 ||| The disk is very clean and has no scratches but there appears to be some sunlight damage or laser damage to the disc so it wont even start up. I am very disappointed with this company for not trying the game before sending it out. On a higher note i had a second game come from this company that is clean and scratch-less but unlike ratchet and clank plays like its brand new.
3 ||| We humans are even more persuadable than we like to think. Cordielia Fine takes us on a breezy tour of some well-known psychological studies, and others that are less well known.We create flattering self-identities and then protect them in the face of evidence to the contrary. We are all delusional. We may like to think that we are logical actors, that we can be persuaded by reason, but when it comes to the test, (and there are many experimental tests) how we imagine ourselves to be, and how we act, are usually at odds.Ms. Fine shows how we are vain, emotional, immoral, deluded, pigheaded, secretive, weak-willed, and bigoted. Is this enough to get you to want to read it? These are the chapter titles. This is an intriguing look into how vulnerable we are to external stimulus and how our brains delude us.The only criticism I have, and it is a minor one, is that I would have preferred less about the author and her family.
1 ||| Says right in the description:Durable steel template frame includes tabs for accurate placement on door or jamb.Works on small doors, but the jamb, or the door frame that the door actually hangs on is a different matter. The template has a strike though, that you can clearly see in the picture above, it was intented, i guess to be a "stop" for the door, but when using it on the jamb,it stops the template from doing it's job and that would be to let you route out a matching cut out for the door's othe hinge flap to fit into, instead it blocks you from doing a jamb cutout, so it will only work on a door, not the casing Jamb.Since i needed it now and did not want to return it, it got out my anvil and mini sledge hammer and knocked the protruding stops flat with the rest of the hinge, and not i can screw or nail it to a jamb and make a perfect cut. Wonder why they didn't think of that.?????
1 ||| Canon, I'm appalled: instead of simply packing the adequate number of steel plates with the various underwater housings, you're selling these things for, I'm sure, 10 or 20 times the manufacturing price, AND complicate matters with the multiple screw/weight combination.
0 ||| I've slogged through nearly half of this book and I turned to the reviews instead (which are much more amusing and a better use of time). At the risk of repeating what *everyone* else is saying, Mr. Jordan, Can You Finish It Already?It's not just that the cast of characters has swollen to include the tiniest thread of plot; they are all the same! All the women are short tempered harpies! All the men fret about what harpies the women are!Deep breath. I truly enjoyed the first four novels in this series. I would even maybe read them again. But is it just me or is RJ trying to ride the WOT gravy train?I will not spend anymore money on this author or his series.Check out Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. It's turning out to be long too but at least things *happen* in his books.
2 ||| Soothing and mellow, but no changes in rhythms or style. If you're in THIS mood, it's fine, but my other Debbie Friedman CDs would be my first choices ahead of this one.
4 ||| this tool really works like it should, you know you bought a tool that was not made to be a facsimile of the real thing
2 ||| Quite a throwaway erotic thriller only redeemed by the presence of Kari Wuhrer (much better than the Shannon Tweed original). Kari certainly has a talent for making R-rated movies and she shows that, quite literally, in this picture.
4 ||| This book is an excellent compilation of the words of the prophets regarding a variety of topics important to our ongoing liberty. This book was recommended in the LDS General Conference by Ezra T Benson in April 1965. If you want a compilation of what the Prophets have said regarding liberty, this is a great primer and will give you the tools to discern between the many opinions in today's society.
3 ||| way too cool, but its totally diffrent from 1 and 2 so look out. at leaste they got rid of those dumb costumes, and lowered item prices. but it still is sweet, go get it!
3 ||| interesting view of soldiers in the roman army at a far post in the hinterlands. the level of detail is enough to keep the flavor of life good and the roughness of life in that time not enviable. The author has made me feel the hard life of a non-com.
4 ||| Great collection at a great price. Not necessarily the best movies ever made but a critical part of Sinatra history
0 ||| This is a compilation of academic papers not intended for the lay reader.The numerous embedded citations are distracting. It is written in sociological jargon rather than English. With hundreds of heavily referenced ideas, there are a few nuggets of wisdom, but these are painfully hard to unearth.
4 ||| Alice is the master and "Dirty Diamonds" is "Perfect".I prefer "Woman of mass distraction","Pretty ballerina","Steal that car","You make me wanna".Perfect songs for the best rocker in the world.I know Alice since 1974 and this is one of your best albuns.BUY NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 ||| Make sure your bike will fit the rack. They have a chart to make sure rack fits car but not that your bike will fit rack. I have two Treck Pures. They won't work on this rack.
2 ||| This was not my favorite Boyle but I am reading everything he wrote so that tells you something. Very interesting and eye opening.It's so enjoyable to read his stories about real people because you can't be too sure how much is true and how much is "Boyle".
3 ||| The title of this album pretty much sums it up. This is an engaging, exhilerating album full of progressive, melodic and power metal.This is a hard album to place in any genre, but i would describe it as Melodic Metal, with strong elements of Power Metal. Fans of Power Metal, eg. Dio, will surely love this, and fans of more alternative Metal will find something to enjoy too.Songs like Center Of The Universe, Descent Of The Arkangel and A Feast For The Vain are epic and powerful songs with strong, driving guitar and good vocals, wheras Farewell and On The Coldest Winter Night are ballads, with sorrowful vocals and meandering music.This is a fun, exciting album that is a great listen.
3 ||| the xm radio is great. I was never one to listen to the radio very much because the DJ's around here suck. not a problem with xm. plus unlike tv there is always something good on. very easy to set up and use. Just make sure you have a southern exposer. I tried using it in my company's break room which faces north east and couldn/t get a signal. Otherwise a great item. I only wish the programming included the Jeff Foxworthy countdown.
2 ||| I admit to being partial to 'Fantasy Lover' and 'Night Pleasures'. It just went downhill from there.I was hoping with all my heart 'Seize the Night' will have the bite back, and it looked promissing... for the first few chapters.Afterwards... it lost the charm, the frivolty, the romance, and the action. It made me wanna cry with frustration.MILD SPOILER:What was that Acheron thing, anyway? Hello? Twilight Zone to the max!And passing around immortality like candy. Just plain nasty!No, ms. Kenyon has definitelly lost what she had at the beginning of this series. I suggest she finds it and pronto!
2 ||| It's a good buy for that kind of style that looks absolutely beautiful on your feet. I've got the gold one and the blue one. The blue pair is a little tight in front unlike the gold pair. Would recommend it to all. The price is good and the shoes are comfy. I can wear them all day long.
4 ||| It was a very good movie The Sting it was about two con men goin for there big con after one of their own dies. I would tell anyone i know to go see it.
3 ||| at his best, Illinois Jacquet was as sensual and inviting as any tenor saxophonist in jazz. It is good to hear the echoes of Herschel Evans in Jacquet's playing. My speculation is that Jacquet influenced Ben Webster as they moved into the 1950's. Partly because there is no squealing this is a 4 star disk because I have to save 5 stars for REALLY GREAT DISKS -- of which there are less than 100.
2 ||| They definitely need to get a better doo for Barbie in the hair dept.No comb or brush will get thru it. Everything else is okay.
0 ||| Bag of cheap parts. Nothing more. Total scam, ripoff. If you sell a car and it's assembled in the picture, you don't send the buyer a box of car parts.BEWARE.
0 ||| This has got to be one of the most boring and tedious movies I have EVER seen, not just out of the Halloween films. The problem isn't that Michael Meyers is not in it. The plot is SO stupid, and the "action" doesn't even start until the last 20 minutes or so. It's not scary at all, is just boring, boring, BORING. It shouldn't even be considered a horror film. I'd put it under science-fiction. Avoid this film at all cost. It wasn't worth the money to make it, and isn't worth the money to rent.
0 ||| Basic technique for filtering out lousy movies: The cast contains 2 or 3 people you almost always enjoy, stars 1 person you've never even seen in a movie but heard of from another entertaintment field, and you've never heard of the movie before. According to imdb.com, this 3-year-old stinker put an end to Thalia's movie carreer, and that's about the only good thing I can say about it. A rambling script and misguided direction (both on the part of the same person) waste the talents of Paul Rodriguez and Danny Aiello (who barely appears). The other performances look more like half-baked read throughs. The fact that the opening sequence is supposed to take place in New York City at Christmastime, but people are running around in short sleeves should tip you off right away. Don't even think about taking a chance on this one.
0 ||| The audio is fine, great music. The video for the Vienna Boy's Choir portion seemed silly and takes away from the music. This might work best just to hear the audio and turn off the video.
0 ||| This book is to fiction what the "White Raven" is to movies. It establishes a base line of mediocrity and tedium virtually unparelelled by anything else you'll find. Clancy can't keep from editorializing about former real life politicians, and he also exposes himself to be a racist and sexist through the so-called dialog of his shallow and boring characters. If you see this one in the bookstore, do yourself a favor and LEAVE IT. It's time to retire, Tom.
2 ||| I understand the book was used but it was definitely not in good condition. I think this book has had a hard life! I guess all the information is the same so I am still happy with my purchase but the condition of the book was a let down...
1 ||| The Vines have good pop music. That's all you can really say about them. They aren't original, aren't good for more than 10 or so listens, and aren't the future of rock. However, few people really care about that. I thought they were fun to listen to for a while, but I found my radiohead and wilco Cds came in much more frequently. I love nirvana, and when I heard "Get free" I thought the vines were the future of rock. They aren't, as evidenced by 7 or 8 absolute filler tracks in this short Cd. The only other good ones are Aint no room and Mary Jane, which both sound like the Beatles. When the vines are original, they [are bad].
2 ||| The safety pins were adequate, but they weren't as sturdy as I would have liked. The size was just right.
2 ||| A very quirky novel, sorta sci-fi, with tongue-in-cheek writing that interacts with the author and reader. A samurai cat goes into hell to kill off Satan and find his sidekick. From there it gets real strange... :-)
4 ||| If you are a person who loves the themes or periods like you play most of the time in D&D you will love this book. I originally saw all of the Lord of the Rings movies first, along with the new Hobbit movie that came out this winter. I do have to say, the movie isn't as good as the book but it was pretty darn close. Tolkien uses his words in a way to intrigue the reader while making them think in a different patter and just sucks you into it. I loved it, and I do recommend reading this book.
4 ||| I purchased this DVD for my 3 year old after reading a review of it in a parenting magazine. It was on a list of "must have" videos. I then checked it out on Amazon and was amazed to see that nearly everyone (65+ people) had given it 5 stars. And I can see why! After only owning it for 10 days, My son can recognize nearly every letter of the alphabet, and knows the sounds that half the letters make. He just adores this video and asks for it repeatedly - which is great, because it's educational! The song is very catchy if corny, but we sing it in the car all the time. The repetition is fantastic for learning. Good Job Leapfrog!
3 ||| If you're the type of person who likes survival novel books, this is the book for you! This book is called My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. The main characters in the book are Sam Gribley, a boy, Frightful, a bird companion, the Baron Weasel, who is also friends with Sam, and Bando, a man who helps Sam. Sam Gribley decides to go out to live alone. There, he is independent at living. Will Sam Gribley ever return home to his family in NYC? I liked this book because it's a first person narrative so it gives more description about the animals, setting, and what he's doing. I also liked the book because I like books about kids, especially a book about a kid and his pet. I highly recommend this book for ages 7 and up.
1 ||| This is a nice book to help review the content on the NCLEX-RN but there really was not much of those application type of questions I needed for the exam. It helped me review the material but honestly other review books with questions were more helpful IMO
4 ||| This was heart-rending and displayedthe same finesse at fully roundedcharacters with their issues. The priest'sdiscoveries and how he dealt with themwere particularly poignant.
3 ||| Ok. I just HAVE to get one of these. I got games that have no case and they are being scratched up BADLY. Including my favorite, Suikoden. I don't have many games so if they don't work, I might start to feel like a big, brown, cup full of (I'll leave this word out for now). :)
0 ||| On page 260 you mention one of the most beloved pastors I have ever known, casting him in a bad light for saying abortion is murder. I have not seen him for years, but he was always a person of real intelligence, grace, integrity, and compassion. Does the unborn have intrinsic value? Does the unborn child deserve rights of protection? Does human life have value??? Pastor Prevo would say it does. Why? Because we are created in God's image. Also the abortionist is a person of value made in God's image and Pastor Prevo would never endorse in any way killing an abortionist...and he makes that clear. This excerpt in your book which I read here online does not give enough context for me to know how you will resolve the situations in your book. I hope it is not just a rant against religion...that the character on page 260 is not speaking for your own views. Since I don't know and am not going to buy it and read it I will end my comments.
1 ||| Boring, boring, boring.... SLOWWWWWWWW. plodding, confusing script, mediocre acting.... dark, depressing.... If you have a weekend you want to wast and it's raining & your dog died and momma is still in prison and the fridge is empty and the roaches won't go away - go for it.... I am donating my copy to the library.
4 ||| Everything the explosions, the flights , the aliens looked so much more brilliant and clear in bluray. The sound was so clear like being at the theater.
4 ||| At the beginning all the girls were very selfish. There mother and sister Beth teaches them to feel better and content. By the end they become good women.
3 ||| its a great story no problems but i wish it had table of contents but for FREE cant beat it
0 ||| Its hardly been a month and the product ceased to work!The fans aint moving.Tried to get hold of customer care and it didnt happen either!
3 ||| A cinematically beautiful film. A mosaic of sympathetic characters, raw emotions and the roads they all intersect on. A deeply emotional tale of regret, rejection, liberation and ultimately finding forgiveness and rediscovering that one true love. A film that will be as relevant in 10 years as it is today.
3 ||| This is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size. We bought it to replace our bulkier Sony DSC-F707. The large screen is wonderful! The video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video. The battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left. The main downside with this camera is the flash. It doesn't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots. If it weren't for the flash, I would have given this a rating of 5 stars. This is overall a good camera.For more serious digital photography, we prefer to use the Sony DSC-F707 as it has a better flash and zoom. However, it is too bulky to carry around.
1 ||| I have been hearing about this book for years and years and never got around to reading it. I finally did, and totally hated it. The prose was very lyrical, but there was hardly any characterization to speak of, and the plot can be summed up as "wizard chases his shadow". It was a very boring, albeit poetically written, story. It reads like an epic poem, flowing writing, but hard to connect with.Whoever recommended this as an "if you liked Harry Potter, then..." is totally off the mark. J.K. Rowling may have been inspired by the wizard school and coming of age story in this book, but the resemblence stops there. This book is completely devoid of the warmth, humor, and delightful reading experience found in Rowling's books. It is 100% exposition. It is more like a modern-day Beowulf than an old-school Harry Potter.
2 ||| I don't get this movie. The story is more than predictable - and still, it is very talentlessly told! And above all, the character descriptions are very very very poor. In brief, The Skulls has no structure at all and leaves me wonder if the makers have cooperated at all, or if they've just quarrelled from the very first shooting day.The third star is for the exciting scenes that it - after all- does provide! But in general, this is really a waste of time.
1 ||| Sure, the "Redwall" series is well-written, and unusual in its use of animal characters rather than humans. That does nothing to alleviate the fact that the plots are all the same as any other epic sword quest. The characters are flat and stereotypical, and the conflicts wrap up a little too neatly. I read the first two books in the series, but I don't think I'll be coming back for more.
3 ||| I read this book during my tour round Europe. Once I started, I read and read continuously until I finish the whole book. In the end, I miss out on almost two days of tour. This is as good as all the other books that I have read before. Keep on giving us these kind of good novel to read, Jackie.
3 ||| The Lost King is a very good novel centering around two individuals who are mind-linked. These two individuals were part of an elite military corp responsible for the protection of the royal family. The royal family was killed in a bloody rebellion except for one survior. The few elite military people remaining try to hide the existence of this child. Unfortunately, the one who led the rebellion is a traitor from this elite group. These three end up together at the same time and place. Now the battle continues as to who will live and who will die. This is a great novel that you will definetly enjoy!
0 ||| The promise in the book is that you will know the book is true if you pray sincerely. That is a silly way to determine the truth of something. This is the flimsy foundation of most Mormons' faith. I have never heard of a single nonMormon scholar who accepts the Book of Mormon as historic. It is over 500 pages and covers many aspects of several cultures, and yet in 170 years, no outside scholars have accepted it as an historical book? That is amazing. Perhaps Satan has a lease around the necks of all scholars who are not Mormon? I'll let Occam's Razor cut where it will. It is a fraudulant book written by a flim flam man. And to think I wasted my time reading it over a dozen times-once in Chinese. It is good to be at peace and away from the mental illness called Mormonism.
1 ||| I did not connect with this film for the following reasons:1. There was a lot of talk that seemed to bog down the pace. Granted, cultural and literary references were plentiful and cleverly integrated, but I too often found the dialogue tedious.2. Many of the plot situations were over the top and just not that funny to me---a tribal roasting interrupted by skin heads??? I felt these silly plot gags were at odds with the often deadpan pseudo(?) intellectual dialogue. The tone of the movie veered from one extreme to the other.3. There really was not much of a plot, which is ok with me if there is sufficient character development. But I didn't find much character development here either. Lots of characters, but what do we learn about any of them? Not much. I saw them more as "type." It was hard for me to care about watching any of them.
4 ||| Cooper is the American Jean Genet and some aspects of his subject-matter may scare people off, but he writes amazingly beautiful prose, has an incredible ear for dialogue, and is quite funny even at his most dark. "Try" is actually a very appealing, offbeat love-story. Give Dennis Cooper a, well, try.
0 ||| 8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running.
1 ||| This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life.
4 ||| This book had wonderful reviews, so I felt luck to find this old copy. They seem perfect for reading- not too long, not too short, not too scary, but with enough of the original Grimm flavor that it is a little scary in places- which I consider to be a good thing.
0 ||| Note to all rock stars: Just because you might've been in a band with a big name, dosen't *neccissarily* mean that the new band you're in will be any good.And so with a band formed from a music reality competition show, Lukas Rossi, with The former four-stringer from Metallica and other famous rock stars like Dave Navarro and people washed out, this album poorly accoplishes it's goal. Instead of sounding like they were concentrating on quality, it sounds as if they were just trying to get the recording/producing part done and overwith so as if they didn't have to concentrate on it. and the worst part: Lukas Rossi, who dosen't even help by contributing some whiny emo on "Headspin", should have been replaced.Sorry, Supernova, but this just dosen't work for any of us.
3 ||| Well, only in the chart position, it's a shame this song didn't got the chart position it deserved over the top 40 in the Billboard 100, but since, Radio keeps playing only hip hop and rap music, it's obvious that LOW didn't got the chance it deserved, this is one of that strong ballads that are uplifting, and yeah you know get on with your life and move on...a great tune by Kelly, and of course the mixes for this song should have been ackward so the extra tracks are mixes by MISS INDEPENDENT a total girl attiutde power infected with great party stomper club mixes, great single, worth the money.
3 ||| The authors clearly love dogs. Some of the stories and testimonies left me in tears. However, as others have noted, some of the material in this book is not to be taken 100% seriously. Looking beyond that, they do make a great case for the mixed-breed dog -- a case that needs to be made at this time.
4 ||| The previous DVD version of T2 had "English (Descriptive Video Service)" as one of the audio tracks. This new one doesn't.I realize it was intended for blind and visually impaired people, but I liked listening to someone describe the non-verbal action of the film. Since I'd already seen the movie many times, it allowed me to walk around my house, doing other things while I "watched" the movie. Since the track was included in the previous disk, I kind of wonder why they didn't keep it.I'm thinking about "upgrading" my T2 DVD to this new version. I was going to either sell or give away the one I have now, but I would miss the DVS track. I really want all the new extras, but do I really need two?Movie - 5 stars (Missing DVS - 0 stars)
0 ||| People- please, think! If you're spending over $1000 on a precision piece of optics, why would you put an cheap window pane in front of it? It sucks that filters cost a bit of money, but seriously, you need to get something that's at least multicoated, and preferably B&W or Heliopan or some other good brand. For a $200 lens, this is fine. But it breaks my heart to see this "bundled" with an $1100 L lens.
3 ||| This movie was good and I really enjoyed it, I thought that it was a delight!And hilarious, but my school put on a play earlier and it was a lot better than the movie... the movie cut out half the songs from the original play. I liked the music and the characters but it would have been better if both the people died at the nd like the play!
0 ||| This isn't really a review of the movie but rather a review of the video sent out. My copy was so bad (just simply too dark) I could not see any the player in the scene. I would guess it just over copied, as besides dark hard edges in the movie (like walls of a building) were wavy. I returned the DVD and got a full refund. I will continue looking for a better copy.
1 ||| Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, "oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it.
4 ||| I have persian cats that I bath. sometimes the water does get in the ear. I no longer have to worry about getting the ear dry without doing any harm to the ear drum. so easy to use and smell great too.
3 ||| This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. There will be some pain at first when using this product, but its gets easier after the first time. The key to using a epilator is to exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate. If not, you will have some serious ingrown hairs. Don't expect your legs to be in anyway as smooth as shaving with a razor though. The epilator works really well for your underarms as well as legs.
0 ||| This novel was about twice as long as it needed to be to tell the story. Someone needs to introduce TC to a good editor, because there was no excuse for the length of this book. It really bogged down the pace and made the novel a chore to read. There was a time when you could count on TC for good tight writing, but those days appear to be over. He hasn't been the same since EXECUTIVE ORDERS. His earlier works are still his best. After this fiasco, it will be a long time before I pick up another Clancy novel.
3 ||| So much easier to read on my Kindle than in print. Much easier on my eyes and the light does not keep my wife up at night.
1 ||| I'm a Maiden fan, but frankly, was a little disappointed with this one. Wasted Years is a good song, but other than that, I don't see anything special here. I recommend earlier albums like Killers, Number of the Beast, and Powerslave. I enjoyed Fear of the Dark as well.
1 ||| I have to say that I was disappointed with this DVD. The variety of dance styles it shows is nice, but the bellydance and bollywood sections were awful. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it is the only DVD I've found so far that even touches on the flamenco style, which I've become interested in lately.
3 ||| I finally got round to the book that began a whole sub-genre: and put headless robed women on the covers of a thousand novels. This is a tale of two sisters, b%#chy Anne and her unfortunate sister who gets to deal with her famous sibling. Of course we all know the ending, but England comes alive in ways it didn't in 10th grade history. Also gave a copy as a gift, and my friend enjoyed it as well.
4 ||| It is true that they teach lessons...that always teach the child that the parent is telling the child not to do something for there is things that will happen either good or bad...that they are only trying too protect the child...teaches them about loving others that arent of the same race or culture....among other things....I think they are wonderful and my now 9 year old loves them...her granmother always gets her them when they come out...
0 ||| This is one of the worst books that I've read. The characters are lifeless. The dialogue among them is dull and illogical. The relationships between the characters seem rushed and unexplainable. I could not see where the "love" developed between the main couple. The sexual relationships were not romantic and were very boring. It was like reading a textbook, with the heroine asking "what's this" kind of questions.
4 ||| The "Out Of The Dust" is a "John Newbery Medal" winner.It starts with a mother wanting a baby boy,but ands up with a baby girl named Bille Jo.Then it gets worse.as it goes on something tragic happens.Then Bille jo is left with one person to help her,but she learns that she can still be happy some times.I liked this book very much.It is a sad,happy,and alot more emotions in this book. I would recommend this book for kids and grandparents.Hope you like it to.
1 ||| I like the problems given in the book, but you cannot use this book to purely teach a student algebra. Much of it needs to be explained from your own knowledge, which is fine for me.The biggest gripe I have about this book is the error on page 12. Problem 1 (x + 5 = 3) should have the solution "x = -2", but the book answers say it is "2". This also results in the wrong answer for the puzzle. The answer should be "Twenty-eight", but solving the problem correctly gives you "Gwenty-eight". I would suggest looking for another resource, since I am not sure if the rest of the workbook has errors that may mislead your students.
2 ||| Fantastic evocation of down and out-er in Mexico; but the plot becomes so unbelieveable insofar as a hobo miraculously becomes a Hollywood star only to scorn a 3 movie contract for stupid reasons. Cain tries too hard maybe to blend Chandler and Hemingway. This also shows the limitations of 1st person narration. Eventually, I couldn't stand the "Then I did this. . . Then I did that" so many times on the same page. Runs around too much to get to a fairly predictable ending.
2 ||| The Oxo can opener is easy to attach to the can, easy to turn, and does a good job of cutting the lid off of the can. But, the can opener always leaves a small portion of the lid attached to the can. It just is never able to cut this last bit of the lid. That requires the delicate act of trying to lift the lid out of the can without cutting your fingers. I will go with side-cutting can opener next time.
1 ||| When first playing this disk I was surprised - I had to check the label to make sure I had not picked up something more related to the film score from Mary Poppins. The first and last tracks are much more akin to Dick Van Dyke's renderings from the Disney classic than the earlier works of Jenkins such as Adiemus.Unfortunately, the rest of the tracks do not make up for the initial disappointment.
0 ||| This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I am currently in the process of returning my second RIO 800 128 MB via the incredibly lengthy sonicblue RMA process (The first return took over 30 days to get a replacement). The players both lasted around 3 weeks before audio became garbled and then they ceased to work at all. Sonicblue customer support is nonexistant, their website offers no information about these players problems, and customer support is clueless even if you do happen to get ahold of someone in less than 30 minutes. DO NOT buy this ...
0 ||| I have recently read some reviews by five star people in response to one star people. They make their case. He is fifteen, say the one star people. They say, Give him a break. After reading this, I have my own views on the matter. First, I admit it is very good for a teen writer. However, it is not good for a published work of fiction. I would accomadate for his flaws and agree with the five star people had he not said on his site, "I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf." Obviously, the publicity of this book has bloated his ego, because his writing is nowhere near that of the aformentioned authors. I can only hope that you will not fuel his vanity and purchase a copy of Eragon.
1 ||| Oh, I know what I'll do. I will make a kids record with some really popular songs so the parents will buy it. Then the kids will love it because it's music "just for them." If there was such a thing as packaged music for kids, this would be it.
1 ||| This one was Ok. It could have been much better. Leatherface was dumb in this one. All he does is put on lipstick and women clothes. It als turns the whole thing around. In the first one The Massacre controlled the other bad people but in this one the bad people Control him! But it was Ok. It was NOT good and NOT bad. That is why I gave it a 2 stars. But it was definitely Not as gruesome and bloody as the first and second -in fact it was not bloody at all. And it had some modern, teen humor in it! It is not worth seeing if you want to be so scared that you can't sleep for 2 weeks straight! Definitely not.
3 ||| good material and cover. needed to cut of most of the part behind the neck to make it comfortable.
1 ||| This spatula is too stiff! I gave it to my daughter and stuck with my old one. Not worth the money.
0 ||| She goes way too fast! I have been doing beginner/moderate yoga for years, and my body yearned for it when I was pregnant! I needed to stretch to relieve my muscles and get pressure off of my joints. THIS WAS NOT THE VIDEO I NEEDED!! She moves through the moves so quickly it's hard to even enjoy the stretch. Plus it's really short, and not all that challenging. I had high hopes since her sisters workout was SO good! The only reason this even gets a star is because I was able to resell it on Amazon for $20. I would not recommend this. For good stretching yoga that relieves the body, I use Suzanne Deason Yoga Conditioning. Some people don't like her because she's too easy--but it totally makes my body feel better.
1 ||| The blueberry bowls I ordered arrived in a periwinkle color... yikes! Returning these as they will not match in my kitchen! Also the packaging was sooooooo dated, which is not a concern as long as goods arrive in one piece I suppose!
2 ||| Moby's 'Play' CD is a real treat - loads of great tracks. However, the quality of the recording is among the worst I've ever heard. The recording quality is so bad that I can only listen to the CD in my car - it's off limits to my high-end stereo set-up. 'Porcelain', one of the best tracks on the CD is a case in point - great music but the background noise/hiss is so prevelant that I wonder whether it was introduced onto the track on purpose for some warped reason. Music rating - 5stars, but the quality is the worst of all my 200 CDs, and so I must call attention to this dramatic flaw - overall rating 3stars (Moby, do yourself and everyone else a favor and get another recording company!!)
2 ||| First of all, let me say that I have no problem with the music on this CD. Every song on this CD--every single one--is 5 star material. However, the buyer should realize that this compilation CD has not one, but TWO mislabeled tracks. The track labeled "Stardust" is actually "Yesterdays" from the "Clifford Brown With Strings" album. Also, the track labeled, "If I Love Again" is, in reality, "Gerkin For Perkin" from "Study in Brown". This error is pure sloppiness on the part of Verve records, and is likely to confuse the uninitiated.
1 ||| With all of the talent involved with this project, this CD should have been much better. Let's see how the next one is. Skip this one.
4 ||| As a mother, a home educator and a former public school teacher, I have always loved having Jan Brett's books around. They're lively, they inspire children to look for detail and they entertain in a wholesome manner. When we saw this book at the library, I immediately had to come home and order one for us. I never thought I'd have a new favorite, besides the Mitten, but this one may be it ! :-)
2 ||| I've had a unit running day and night for almost 2 years straight, it seems to work great and kills odors pretty well. Cleaning the fins is easy but notice that over time some parts are tougher to clean and keep clean over long period of use. The only thing wrong with my unit is that it runs great on the high setting but it shuts down by itself on the lowest setting. It doesn't matter to me since I just keep it on high all the time. I paid much less for mine after it had already became popular and went into its demise but mine's been well worth it.
1 ||| I shpuld have shopped around more I found them cheaper locally after I had ordered...price of convience I guess....
1 ||| After _Trinity_, one of Uris' best works, we are given his worst. It is almost as though he is having trouble remaining focused on the story; there are frequent flashbacks to the climactic passages in _Trinity_, usually for no apparent reason. Some stories gallop, some walk purposefully; _Redemption_ meanders aimlessly, retraces its steps, and bonks into trees.The only redeeming feature of the book is the description of Gallipoli, which is still a sore point in Australia and New Zealand and deserves comprehension and remembrance throughout the Western world. Unfortuately one must suffer through the rest of the book to get to the Gallipoli part, and unless you are extremely interested in that particular topic, this book is not time well spent.For an idea of what Uris has accomplished in the past, try _Topaz_ or _QB VII_ in addition to _Trinity_. Given the other great reading Uris has provided us, let's forgive him for this one.
0 ||| Stand in the Wind is really a boring book! It really wasted my time. I couldn't help skipping pages. Don't read this book!
4 ||| For anyone who is seeking a fuller more rewarding lifeand knows they are spiritual - the marriage of quatumphysics and prayer is deeply moving.
1 ||| I have to agree with many reviewers that the 5th season is disappointing. We got to know Dr. Martin as uptight, rude and cold man and still accepted him as such, because he is also a brilliant devoted doctor and a hero at times.But what's hard to accept is the fact that the birth of his love child with Louisa, a cute baby boy, did not change him one bit. In fact it doesn't make sense that he seems even more pissed off than ever in the 5th season, and there are no moments of emotional connection between him and Louisa or him and the baby what so ever.On top of that, the 3 new characters in the 5th season; the new female doctor, Martin aunt Ruth and Louisa's mother are all rather unpleasant problematic women. And the new receptionist Morwenna is just a bore.I am still looking forward to the 6th season in 2013, but really hope that Dr. Martin will loosen up and change for the better and enjoy his life with the lovely Louisa and their son.
2 ||| The concept is interesting enough. The characters could be engaging. But ultimately this novel falls flat. The dialog is very poorly written. And while science fiction writers can certainly assume a number of improbable things it is best to be parsimonious. The author dishes them out in medium-large expository lumps.On the whole, it was a bit too much like watching a remake of "The Thing" set in Pittsburgh.
1 ||| Its always fun to own a Zippo. I am not sure though that the description "uses butane fuel" is accurate. Its not airtight enough. Flares up! Its neat, cause it burns much too quickly to cause serious injury (although it most definitely could). I'm new to these lighters, so I am not sure if what I am doing something wrong (overfilling, for instance), but after flaring up, the wick stops lighting up even though the flint creates a spark.
1 ||| When this group rocks, they wail -- reference cuts #1, #2 and #13. Other than that, having listened to the CD several times, and been a popular music fan all my life, I'm not sure what I heard except a bunch of kids playing around with electronics. Many groups have experimented with new musical forms, themes, lyrics, and so on, over the years, sometimes with results that have a significant impact either immediately or over time. Far from being a trendsetter, this CD, in its better cuts, temporarily entertains, while overall, it costs much more than it is worth and resells at a very steep discount.
2 ||| Of course, I picked up this book because it was written by my favorite author. His other books were thrilling and good, and I thought this one would be the same... But no, it turned out otherwise.I barely knew anything about jets when I first started to read this book. But the book taught me some stuff, and I found it educational.... In a way. It was interesting, but where's the fast-paced stuff that I expected? Nowhere... There were lots of abbreviations and I had some difficulty catching up on those stuff. Either I didn't know what they were, or I forgot what it was and had to look back and find out. The book was kind of slow, but it was interesting enough to finish it. I had to look up words in the dictionary, too! And I had expected something amazing at the end, but no, it wasn't... So it's 3 stars for me.
2 ||| The book Lord of the Flies by William Golding is one of Golding's best books. It is about a group of British boys who get stranded on an island. At first the boys have good intentions, but as time passes those intentions change and they break up into 2 groups the fire-watchers which are led by Ralph and the hunters led by Jack. Ralph who becomes good friends with Piggy thinks more about being rescued and setting up sort of a community. Jack and the hunters on the other hand think more about getting meat and themselves. This book not only tells an exciting adventure story, though, it also describes on a deeper level, the thin line between civility and insanity, and how young children can become insane without some amount of authority and discipline.
0 ||| This product is a waste of money,everything meaning quality is ZERO in this AudioSource product!I dispensed it!
1 ||| Thoroughly enjoyed the half about the Golden Gate Bridge. Really unbelievable. Eye opening, I had never heard anything like that about the bridge before.The half about her relationships and living in her city, not so much. The style showing scenes from all over the area were great at first, but then started to feel like a slide show. Slow paced, could have used a little more creativity. Overall, would not recommend. Too dry and artsy to be considered a documentary.
0 ||| I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought. It is only 16 pages. I do not blame the seller. I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it.
0 ||| I have had trouble with this piece of hardware since I installed it. I went through numerous conversations with D-Link support trying to identify the issue, installing different driver versions and none of them have worked. Don't buy it, if you want my advice.
2 ||| While not up to some of the music produced with Vincent Herring this is still and excellent bluesy outing with nice selection of not to ofetn heard tunes.Can't go wrong with Walter"Bookie" Booker or Jimmy Cobb the pleasant surprise here is Rob Bargad a pianist not high up on radar who plays a nice funky/bluesy style al la Timmons of the Adderley's original "Mercy,Mercy,Mercy" writer Joe Zawinul (before he lost his way into fusion...oh well them's fightin' words fopr some and "Can't we all just get along?".All in all this is worth the super cheap asking price and you might even pull it out now and then.For a better Nat/Herring pairing I'd get "Old Folks" or "Tribute To Cannonball".But this is worth getting.I'd definitely give it 3.5 or maybe a 4 star if your a devotee.Chazz
0 ||| Worked well until Week Six, when it died. Unilaterally changed its own status to "read only" -- meaning, you can't take more pictures until you buy a new one.This is when I said to myself, "Maybe I should have read those hundreds of one-star reviews ..."
2 ||| Is this film really PG13 in USA? In Finland it is not allowed below 15 years, which is as it should be. Of course, films are getting more and more violent, but more than this I do not care. There were a couple of things that were good in this film. One of them was Eastwood himself. The other actors were good, too. Ben Johnson is always great, but his part was very small. This is a typical revenge story. That's a main motive in westerns. Is it enough to get a man to risk his life until the rest of his life in order to finalize his evenge? In real life one hopefully would give up. Eventhough he was almost hanged. There were some loose ends in the story. Perhaps this was meant to be so. Inger Stevens is looking men who rape her, but does not find them. Eastwood is feeling pangs of mercy, but the film requires revenge. Was it really necessary to have the long hanging celebration? It took a great part of the film.
1 ||| I knew I buy a second handed book but I thought it will look nice butit doesn't fit my expectations.The book itself is very helpful for minerals and gemstones collectors.
1 ||| This guard didn't fit right - uncomfortable, and I found it very difficult to sleep that I had to take it out. Unfortunately, I will have to keep looking but thinking the ones you boil and mold to your teeth would be better for me.
1 ||| The movie starts slowly as you wait for pierce brosnan to be more a part of the movie. Then Brosnan is truly a dispictable character (unless you love sociopath sex addicts) with the only good guys being the revolutionaries and the tailor. There are plenty of vulgar language and dialog, plus some T and A, so this one is for 18 year olds and up, or no one at all.In true left-wing Hollywood style, the bad guys win, and there are untrue references to President George Bush, "#41".
3 ||| This retelling of the life of Jesus, is a simple, straightforward account. It would be very nice for a teenager or useful for a youth minister or a Sunday school teacher of teens and/or young adults.Bible Scholars and readers who enjoy more poetic language and more complexity would probably not enjoy this version; however, I don't think that's who it's intended for! :)I would recommend it for use by and instruction of younger readers and less experienced readers of the Bible.
2 ||| I got this movie with no expectations becasue my lids were interested in it. It actually was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Considering that most of the ideas came from a 6-year old, I found it watchable. My daughter watched it once the first day, 4 times the 2nd day, once on the 3rd day (she ended up on a playdate or I am sure that it would have been several times that day as well) She watched another time during the week because school, homework, and a school performance got in the way. She is looking forward to tomorrow when she can watch it again. It may not be Oscar worthy by adult standards but the kids seem to really like it.
3 ||| This movie is ok,but it is more focused on littler kids.You can tell that it is by the songs and stuff. This movie doesent really go indepth on some of the key events that happen in the book.But if you dident know about all those events it's a good movie.So I sugjest that you watch the movie before you read the book, but make sure you read the book.This movie is a great gift for a younger brother or sister.
4 ||| I like using these shirts for my kids who don't like sunscreen. These shirts were the best value, are comofortable and good quality. Remember not to put them in the dryer!
4 ||| This has always been one of my favorite stories, and I love the illustrations that accompany the text in this book. I'm very pleased with this edition.
3 ||| Only used it once to start a car, had it about two months. Worked great in that one use. However:1)This unit is somewhat dangerous. It came without any covers for the live (always live!!) copper teeth. This could cause a short and possible fire hazard. No 'on-off switch' on this. Be careful how and where you store this.2)Cables are short, you must tie it to your engine well or have someone hold it. If it ever fell into your engine it could do some damage.Unit is heavy, has a nice guage to see how it is charging and how much charge is left. Comes with 12Volt carger so can be charged in a car, also can be plugged in with (not provided) extension cord into household 120V power. A 'normal' extdension cord works fine but it won't fit one with multiple female ends.I will update this review after I use it more.
3 ||| i.e., by rapidly-successive turns she's both absolutely insufferable And absolutely rapturous :) tracks 5 and 10 from disc one, and 1, 4, 6 and 7 from disc two are impeccable and beyond compare to Anything else you'll find out there. tracks 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14 and 15 from disc one, and 9 from disc two are distinctly less impressive, though still enjoyable. as for the rest: i haven't bothered to endure pseudochic nattering This indulgently banal (courtesy mm himself, alas) since the interludes on grace jones' otherwise fantastic "slave to the rhythm" album :p luckily, the good is mostly separable from the bad :)a tip for international buyers: stick with the american release. while the french issue sports a different (nicer?) cover, it does Not include disc two which, as i just got done pointing out, has some of the best stuff :) sorry, i've no info about the uk version :(vt
2 ||| I can still recall the horror and surprise I felt in the middle crisis of this story. I reread it several times to make sure I had not made a mistake. From that point on the story became more trite though it did have a mystical aspect to it. I felt that the author left the reader dangling in the end with a lot of gaps and holes in the plot. Still it was an interesting read but I wouldn't buy the book- get it at the library. It reminded me quite a bit of The Horse Whisperer but it wasn't of the same caliber.
3 ||| \it is a lovely musical with professional actors well mimicking hardship of US history of the time pioneering.Once to see good enough.
3 ||| At first i liked the song "somebody told me" but not enough to buy the album. then when i heard "mr. brightside" i decided to give it a try. at first i was very dissapointed but it's grown on me.the only song on it similar to "Mr. brightside" is "on top" (one of my favorites) there are two songs with a gospel choir at the end and at first that bothered me but now i like it more.i think its good that we have a band as innovative and creative as the killers. if you liked the first two singles i'd say you will deffinietly like the cd. but it may take some time to grow on you.
2 ||| Now that you gotten rid of the 4 original cast members its really weird to watch .. may have to watch it again in its entirety
3 ||| I like the way this one turned out! Looks like they neatly and tidily wrapped up the G'ould saga and can now close out the series without loose ends, or have them move on to other enterprises like getting rid of those pesky Ori, once and for all!
2 ||| As a fan of northern New Mexico as well as our nation's atomic history, I was expecting a bit more than this superficial look at the life of Edith Warner and her impact on the Los Alamas/San Ildefanso areas. While it's pretty good at conjuring up mental imagery, the writing is not terribly smooth. This is probably because Ms. Warner didn't appear to leave a very large diary, so the rest is filled in by the personal commentary of Ms. Pond Church who was a sporadic visitor to the "house" at best during the period and writes in a very different style than Ms. Warner. All in all, I just didn't feel it ever got to the heart of Ms. Warner's story, but it was a nice "read" nevertheless.
2 ||| I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. Many of the card images are pixelated.I bought a tarot deck mainly for research purposes and I chose this one because it seemed highly recognized and regarded -- and, from the samples, I thought the pictures were wonderful.However, not all the cards have the same quality art as others. I am not sure why that is. I am not talking about pixelation here I am talking about the actual drawings. Some are excellent, while some look very sloppily drawn. Not sure if Godfrey Dowson got tired after a while or what.Anyway, the price was perfect so I really cannot complain too much.
1 ||| Jack Reacher is the same violent loner that he was in the first, second, third... twenty-third book. Just too much violence and the end of the book is just as silly as the end of all of the Lee Child books. Lee Child writes so well, why don't the stories live up to the writer.
3 ||| These things are the best way I've found to carry around my iPod headphones while avoiding a serpentine mess of cords in my pocket. Highly recommended.
2 ||| This camera is excellent in many regards -- but it has a real flaw. I've had mine for 6 months, and now it will not work; the battery light is on, but new batteries don't solve the problem. The lens moves agonizingly slowly and will not return to its proper position. I thought I was just unlucky but in the last few weeks I've been told about the exact same problem by 2 other people who have this camera!! And I don't converse about cameras very much... Nor is Olympus very helpful. Their 800 number leaves me on hold for so long that I've never gotten through; searching their website is a multi-step process (what's wrong with a little box where you type in what you're looking for?) which leads one to, yes, the 800 number. I've now found out where to send the camera for repair, but I sure wish I'd bought something else.
2 ||| In the past week I have read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and Hearts in Atlantis. They are very different. Both are very worthwhile. This book sucks you in and won't let you go. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is very fast paced and I love the message. The last few paragraphs are outstanding. A recommendable book-even if you aren't a Sox fan.
4 ||| This is arguably the best movie I have ever seen. I saw it in the theater when it came out & went back several times to see it again. I couldn't have been happier when it came out on tape & I could see it uncut for TV again--even though it was a cumbersome 2 tape deal. Now, this 50th anniversary DVD version fills my heart with nostalgia & great happiness. The 2 books add a depth to the story of the making off the movie that was enjoyable as well as informative. The extra discs provide insight as well as entertainment. It was even interesting viewing the silent version made back in the 1920's. It is reassuring that this 50+ year old movie still means enough to the industry that they would issue this commemorative edition. I was surprised to see it was numbered as part of a limited edition.
1 ||| This book is a collection of old photos matched to new photos supposedly taken of the same locations as they appear today.Unfortunately, there are some very blatant errors. Certain photos look, at first glance, like the same location. But quite a few are actually not. And some that do match the location are taken from a different vantage point, making it hard to understand what exactly you are looking at. I do not believe that the authors reside in the Twin Cities, which may explain the sloppiness.The photographs (both old and new) are nice, hence the two stars. But Larry Millett, a local architecture critic, created a far better volume which was impeccably researched and meticulously rephotographed. Skip this one, and seek out Millett's "Twin Cities: Then and Now" instead.+
2 ||| It does what it's suppose to do and for the price it's an OK product.I would have wished it was made of a heavier material and had a longer base so it does not fall over so easily.
2 ||| While hiking the Appalachian Trail with her mother and brother, nine year old Trisha McFarland leaves the path to use the bathroom in the woods. No one saw her leave the path and she ventures so far into the woods that she is unable to find her way back. So begins The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.I'm a huge Stephen King fan. That being said, I was a little disappointed in this book. His stories usually grab me right away and don't let go until the very end. This one didn't do that. It wasn't a bad book at all. It just didn't grab me. As a matter of fact, this is about the fourth time I've tried to read this book and the first time I ever got past chapter two. Once I did get past chapter two, I was more interested in the story and was able to finish. I'm not a baseball fan either, so that probably added to my disinterest. Funny thing is, this book will probably appeal to people that are not fans of Stephen King's typical fare.
4 ||| This is an excellent basic starter kit for N scale model railroading. It is good value for money.
4 ||| Haven't listened to the Beatles in some time. I live in Las Vegas and family is coming to visit and we are taking them to see "LOVE". I have seen it once before and it is fantastic. I bought this CD and Magical Mystery Tour to get ready for the show. I simply forgot how good they were and the CD is a classic. My favorite song on this is......impossible to choose. Sorry for the people who didn't grow up with this group and missed all of the excitement.Buy this!
2 ||| I was dissapointed by the "clunkiness" of this game. The framerates are choppy, controls were stiff and the aiming stinks. Not a comparrison with [edited] but I could see this game having some fans. I would rent first.
0 ||| AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOIDI watched about half an hour of this nasty transfer last night, it was awful: sound quality is atrocious, the print is lousy. Which I supposed lives up to its billing, "...the best print we could find."AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOIDOf course the Criterion Collection version has to be great -- avoid the LaserLight! The only reason I can think of to buy this turkey is the TRULY WEIRD intro by that renowned Hitchcock expert Tony Curtis. Even that is just sad.
2 ||| With the AMA as the source for the content I had confidence that the medical info was current and most reliable and I would give this book a 5 for content, also a 5 for the reasonable price. However I was disappointed that it had so few colored illustrations, was divided up into chapters devoted to disease categories or age of patient, was not "thumb indexed" to enable quick access alphabetically, and lastly I could not find a date for the most recent year this material had been updated.
3 ||| I purchased Sade's Lover's rock album back in 2000-2001. I found her album to really satify my need to relax and think about situations I was going through. Her delightful voice combined with her soulful lyrics produces a serine enviorment for any true music lover. Lover's Rock is not much different from any other album she has previously released. Her songs are based on the same topics, love and relationships which I feel to be a good thing it shows consistency. Lover's Rock has proven for me to be the best song on the album, and it's also the the title for the album.Her hit single King of sorrow also display her talent and ability to touch her audience. I plan to have this album in my cd rotation for a long time.
1 ||| I felt that the most valuable material in the dvd was the fulcrum, lever and base combined with the two way action. Unfortunately, there are very few close ups clearly showing the wrist action and hand placements. The instruction would have been much more effective with close ups and slow motion.I was disappointed with the focus of the dvd being more on Leon Jay's emphasis on the pressure points striking without providing any real instruction on that topic. I did not see the connection between the title of the dvd and what the emphasis of the instruction that is actually on the dvd is. The title could have just as easily been Leon Jay shows off his knowledge of pressure points and knocks a few people out.However, the real value and a special treat on this dvd is a short biography of Professor Wally Jay. Well done and worth the price of the dvd alone.
1 ||| Don't believe the book's cover. The reference is not even a quarter complete. Many ActiveX controls are missing. Where are the references for the database? Why include Usercontrol references in the book when even the Winsock control is not covered? The source code examples in the CD are next to useless. Why call this book the #1 Definitive Master reference???? I want my money back.
3 ||| If you have seen Black Mask and Run Lola Run, then you will know where they got the ideas for The Matrix; and both movies were made before The Matrix. I rented the DVD and I'm going to buy both the CD Soundtrack and the movie!
1 ||| I normally buy Pampers Cruisers, I will not buy these again. They seem really cheap, plastic like, I don't like the smell. Yuck, can't wait for the jumbo pack to be done!
4 ||| This is a must-have if you're a real Jarreau fan. Wonderful music. The slew of Grammys didn't come until a year or two later when Al came out with Breaking Away but This Time might have been even better. You will be uplifted by this CD. Get it.
1 ||| Ok, so Riedel Vinum Port Glasses are in fact beautiful, I certainly don't dispute that. When I saw them in the store I thought, "that's exactly what I'm looking for." $21 a piece ($85 for six or whatever it is), a little steep but I'll bite the bullet and get 'em. Then I picked them up. Why would someone design such a beautiful glass (or anything for that matter) and insist on putting their name on it. Tacky. I don't advertise at my dinner table. As a professionally trained chef I recommend going for the official port glass, authorized by the IVP - Instituto do Vinho do Porto and designed by world acclaimed Portuguese architect Siza Vieira. <$37. I believe they ship from Europe so it may take a few to get them here in the states...mine are on the way.
3 ||| The book was deliverd fast and for the price, new you can't go wrong. Plus, it's packed with useful information for todays man.
4 ||| I'm not a very fan of this artist, but i must to say that "Med√∫lla" is a great record with very good sounds and songs...she's back with a lot of alternative sounds and rhythms...whatever, congratulations for this amazing cd!..
0 ||| This had to be the longest, dullest movie I have ever watched. Though to be honest I did fast forward through a great deal of it because it was so incredibly boring. Way too much Kevin Costner! Dennis Quaid was okay as Doc Holliday, though Val Kilmer was much more fun and interesting in Tombstone. Lewis Smith as Curly Bill definately could have been developed more. He's a gorgeous guy and should have been in more scenes and given a few lines to speak. His character was spoken about amongst the leading characters quite a bit leading the viewer to think he was 'important' though his character never developed in this rendition of the story. In Tombstone, Curly Bill was definately a major character and I just wish Wyatt Earp had done the same instead of making the viewer wonder what all the talk was about.
2 ||| The songs selected to create this mix were very good but I found a problem with track #3, #7. I found #3 vocals distorted as if the recording was turned too high. #7 volume of track goes too low to be normal. Buy this CD if you don't mind skipping these 2 tracks.
1 ||| I'm an amateur ripper-ologist and am interested in who everyone thought did it, so I picked up Patricia's book at the local library. I was sadly disappointed. Patricia is an excellent writer, I'll give her that, but the way she put this book together made me think, "HUH?" She says, "Here's who did it," and that's about it. She had a theory and nicely fit all the facts around it, which is the WORST case of detecting I've ever seen. Every good detective, professional or amateur, knows that you never fit the facts to fit your theory. She doesn't even explain how she came to figure out Sickert was Jack. She just says, "He is, and here's why." I've read other books that gave just as compelling arguments for other suspects, but at least they explain why they believe their choices are right.Ah well, can't wait to get to heaven and find out who the real Jack the Ripper was. Believe me, it's the only way ANYONE's going to find out for sure.
1 ||| I've been a big fan of the Droll Yankee Flipper, and have had it for about seven years. For some reason, even after inserting new rechargable batteries, it will not hold a charge for long. I decided to replace it with a non-battery Yankee Whipper. The reviews appeared to be good and said it was pretty much squirrel proof. Our local squirrels figured it our in less than three minutes. If there is any way a squirrel can reach the feeder from a bush underneath the feeder, they can beat the system. They hang on by putting their front paws in two of the feeding holes and eat out of the third. I've cut my bushes back, but it's amazing how high these squirrels can jump. The Flipper would be the way for me to go if I had to order another one.
1 ||| I bought this video based on the rave reviews it has received. I have the Kathy Smith and Billy Blanks kickboxing videos, and was looking to vary the routine. The first part of the video seemed great, with easy to follow demonstrations, and a killer buns/thighs floor workout. However, the rest of the video was disappointing. After all the talk about "go at your own pace," I thought the floor exercises went much too fast. During the standing portion of the workout, Grogran loses count on every section, and the music beats don't match the workout counts. This may not be a big deal for some, but I found it very distracting. I am used to instructors that are conscientious about working both sides of the body evenly. As to the "fun" factor: Grogan kept telling me to have fun, but I didn't, not even after the fiftieth time he told me to! I can only recommend the buns/thigh drill portion of video at the beginning if you take it at a slower pace.
0 ||| Completley beyond the fact that these tops barely cover Barbie at all, they won't stay closed because of the button on the back that makes the fairy wings flap so you can't even get them on. When I did manage to get he blue top on it kept popping up over Barbies assets because it was so small. Really dont' bother, this is a waste of money!!!
3 ||| Another good release from the best of all METAL bands. This EP contains one of the greatest metal songs ever written, "Chemical Warfare". The other songs on this EP are above average but nothing special. Buy it just for CW.
4 ||| This was a brand new OEM part, in the box. Worked great. Awesome price, saved almost 50% from other vendors.
0 ||| I have bought 3 titles from this company; 1 HDDVD and 2 blu ray. The HD DVD and one of the BD were awful. Though they are 7.1 surround, it seems that original "master" could have easily been from an 8 track. The second BD was not even recorded correctly thus it was unusable, the audio was like a 45 RPM disc playing at 33RPM and the video portion did not even work. From the many different music BD's (>20) ranging in genre from opera to rock and roll that I have purchased this is the only label that I would rate as utter trash. Again DO NOT BUY ANY RECORDINGS FROM ACOUSTIC REALITY EXPIRIENCE, they are a complete and utter rip-off. Avoid this label like the plague. Caveat Emptor.
2 ||| I'm 14 and I wanted to do a few things for luck, money, women, and revenge. I thought this book would help alot, I was sort of right. It should be a SLIGHTLY INTERMEDIATE book instead of a BEGINERS. Most spells require you to make a GUFFAH BAG....but it doesn't say exactly how. It also requires a few hard to find "ingredients" like fox, or muskrat intestine. Overall I'd say get this as your SECOND witchcraft book.
1 ||| This was purchased primarily for the calendar function and address book. It is slow, requires more key strokes and requires that my Dell Inspiron 1100 have additional RAM. It will not do certain functions necessary to preserve an accurate record of appointments when the appt. is recurring and I want to edit one or more of the series. It restores all previous edits to the original series status, deleting any individual appt. edits. It also deletes records older than six months according to what colleagues have said. BUT, it hasn't locked up my PC like the very user friendly Palm OS did, resulting in whole days worth of lost scheduling.
4 ||| I've been buying Bosch bits from Home Depot. Generally, drilling concrete, I was lucky to sink four holes before the bit became bent and useless (they would bend long before they became dull). These bits are considerably less expensive and a better quality. If you have a similar problem, you might give these a try. I'm happy.
0 ||| I wish someone would have told me that this locking cap is a pain in the butt to operate before I purchased it. Don't put it on without some practice first, then consider that the little metal guard over the key hole is going to make unlocking even more difficult. I threw it away because it was too much work.
3 ||| Yes, there are parts that are a bit tricky. If you don't like a challenge don't bother with it but it is very involving and well laid out. Great story line with wonderfully interactive characters all providing enough clues and goodies to keep the game moving.If you like intelligent, challenging games then this one will be for you, otherwise just stick with the kiddie stuff.
3 ||| I really enjoyed doing this Bible study with my kids. However, I just want to warn the reader that if you're using this with a younger child, be aware that it does mention 'having s*x, and fornication. I wasn't prepared when it came up, and I'm glad my ( 8 year old) child wasn't reading it on his own. This may not be an issue for some, but it caught me off guard and I just wanted to give a heads up. Otherwise, we really got a lot out of this book!
3 ||| If you're a Harry Potter fan, you will love the extras like the photo album and "making of" videos. However, I expected that volumes 3 and 4 would include an extended version like volumes 1 and 2, but they did not. If I can see the extended version on ABC Family Channel, then I should get that version in an "ultimate" edition.
2 ||| I bought this as a gift for my daughter. I realize that I bought it used but it should have stated somewhere that it had someones name written all over it. I was a bit annoyed at that. Otherwise the DVD plays fine and I guess it was a reasonable purchase.
4 ||| I have a 5 month old daughter and we have had this play center for about a month. SHE LOVES IT!!! It didn't take her long to spin herself around so she can look and play with everything. She especially loves the red, blue and yellow spinners (first things she discovered) and now she's really into the button that makes the cow sounds and laughs at daddy and I while we dance to the song. Everything is brightly colored and she can sit in it for hours. She also loves to "talk" to the dragon puppet. It's her favorite toy.
0 ||| It has to be. Everyone laugh. hahahahahahahahahaha. Laughable. What is This? A weak attempt to crossover to the mainstream even though she was already there. This is what you call a sell out album. Temptation of Fame made her sellout her substance for style. Nothing Much else To Say.........I dont know what to tell ya. Best Of Me with Jadakiss is pretty hot though. Besides that it's kinda eh blase' Nothing else even worth mentioning on this cd. Oh yeah the production really brings out the weakness in her voice. It Was weak before but now it is really noticeable and it sounds horrible. Please dont buy this and dont even dub it. Warning Has Been Issued!
1 ||| The bars were OK I guess. The packaging was not the best and all of the bars melted into one pile of gooey mess. I would not order from here again.
0 ||| I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ! I GOT THE PRODUCT AND IT WAS A MESS! FIRST, THE WAY IT LOOK WAS VERY OLD AND THE LABEL WAS FALLING APART! SECOND THE EXPIRATION DATE WAS SCRATCH OFF ON THE SIDE AND UNDER THE PRODUCT IN THE BOTTOM IT WAS WIPED OFF! IT WAS SO SUSPICIOUS BUT, UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE EXPIRATION DATE I AUTOMATICALLY JUST OPEN A LITTLE AT THE TOP TO CHECK IF IT WAS REALLY COOKIES AND CREAM! IT WAS BUT, I DO NOT TRUST IT AT ALL WHY WAS IT WIPED OFF AND SCRATCH OFF? SOMETHING FISHY OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING! NEVER GOING TO BUY FROM THE SELLER AGAIN! IF I COULD RETURN THIS ITEM IT WILL BE WONDER!
0 ||| Not pleased with his product. It says "LARGE camera pouch" but even a medium camera (Panasonic DMZ 18) will not fit into it.
1 ||| Now that the right wing has trashed the Clintons, who is gonna trash the Bush's?Who will be the first pundit to blame 'W' for aiding the Bin Laden's and Saddam Husseins while profiting Cheney's Halliburton?To be honest, I am sick to death of conservatives trashing democrats and liberals tar-and-feathering republicans. It is time for a leader to stand up and speak out FOR something instead of AGAINST everything the other guy represents.Noonan has, this time, told us what's wrong with somebody. I wish this were the last such tome, but I know better. Noonan usually is good with the quip but tedious when going beyond a two-minute sound bite. This book is Noonan not at her best, but, should please her fans.
0 ||| I don't think I have to say anything about this unique film. The Dude abides, period.I was excited to hear about this new "special collector's edition". It is basically a re-marketed version of the same thing. No interviews, no commentary, no new 'making of' (yes, it's the same making of as the last DVD), and no frills. It's a fleece-the-moronic-fans deal. What a disappointment.Oh, yes. The only new thing it seems to have is "introduction by Mortimer Young". Oooh, whopee, that sure is worth my money! Who the hell is that anyway?
4 ||| We ordered two of these and they work really well when it comes to preparing apples for the pies. Great quality and price...........which, of course, makes for a Great Deal !!!!
4 ||| I have owned several rice cookers in the past but this one is by far the best. It makes perfect rice every time.
2 ||| I bought this product back in 2005 for the birth of my first baby. The bubbles stopped working on it,so I was quite disappointed . My daughter is now using it in her crib. And she's 18 months old now. So it's been a pretty good toy to have for the crib. I just wish it would have kept working properly. My daughter loves the lights and music it plays.
3 ||| Henry Roth was a truly talented writer and I feel frustrated as a reader that there are only a few books of his to read. However, "Call it Sleep," is a wonderfully full and vibrant novel about a poor Eastern European Jewish family that settles in the Lower East Side slums of New York. David is the protagonist, a small, fearful, and imaginative boy who must contend with the fast moving intensity and danger as a foreigner in New York. He is surrounded by moving characters, such as his brutish and impatient father, who struggles to support his family or Aunt Bertha, the sanguine flirt who represents the peace and comfort of the old world. I don't ordinarily enjoy these kinds of sociological novels, but Roth is able to conjure up breathtaking images, and he paints his canvas with fascinating dialects with encompass the multi-culturism of American life. "Call it Sleep," is truly a neglected piece of depression-era literature.
1 ||| This is one of the worst books i have ever read. I know the author is young(i'm still younger than him tho, but my god, the writing in this novel is disgusting. I almost threw up reading it, i seriously did. Maybe it's just because i'm used to the writings of Tolkien and George R.R. Martin, but this guy really needs to learn how to write. Hopefully he'll get better and at least become as competant as Robert Jordan, but that still isn't anything to brag about.
1 ||| I gave 5 stars for 2001, 4 stars for 2010, 3 for 2061, and... I was tempted to give 1 star or none at all, but I felt sorry for Arthur C. Clarke, because he is my favorite writer... So what is this book? Half lecture, half pulp science fiction... Surely, he could have done much better than this!!! SHAME... TT
0 ||| I have never felt indebted to by someone I did not personally know, but William Friedkin owes me two hours of my life back. Bug joins "Wicker Man" and "The Bridge to Terabithia" as one of the worlds most deceptively advertised movies, and certainly one of the worst. This is the worst possible genre Hollywood has ever come up with; The Statement. There is supposed to be a message in a Statement, but I've not been able to discern it in Bug.The movie unwinds interestingly enough, but then seems to go nowhere. Plot elements clash; Why does the doctor smoke hash? Seems unusual for a medical professional, at least in public. Why does the very dangerous ex-con boyfriend not just toss the loony bugman out? What is the point of this somewhat disgusting and very disturbing movie?William, if you are reading this, feel free to contact me. We can work out the cost of the two hours, and maybe I can fill you in on what movie making is supposed to give the viewer.
0 ||| With Walk On coming out 8 years after Third Stage, a person would think that Tom Scholtz had more than enough time to write plenty of strong material for a new, but I guess not. Walk On is a total bomb. Boston is a great band, but with this album they really missed the mark. None of the songs make a lasting impression. Stick with the first three albums.
1 ||| The music box was nice and it works, but the nativity looks cheap. I gave these as gifts and I was embarrassed because it looked like I bought it from the Dollar Store for $5.
3 ||| Bell's novel recreates the Haitian revolution through the eyes of several different vibrant characters. We as readers come to experience this event as though we were really there. The Island is transformed before our eyes from a slave colony to a surrealistic Hell on earth where bands of men travel the countryside in search of blood and cities burn with regularity. Delving into the minds of slaves, masters and soldiers equally the book shows every side of the event in vivid life. The themes in this book ring out every bit as pertinant today as when the revolution unfolded. The issues of racial hatred and class warfare exist now in America even if they live subdued beneath the surface of everyday life. This novel explores what happens when the shroud is pulled back and the passions and hatred of men is let loose.
3 ||| This is a very engaging book. It was lots of fun to be introduced to Long Piddleton and to its assortment of eccentric characters. The plot itself is fairly complex, although not completely difficult to figure out, and it ends with what appears to be an action sequence in the life of the Richard Jury books--in a church, no less!It is interesting to be introduced to Vivian, the femme fatale of Richard Jury, Melrose Plant, etc., in this book. I am not sure that I ocmpletely see the attraction, but that seems to be one of the interesting truths about relationships that comes out in Martha Grimes' books--relationships and attractions have a strength and life of their own.
4 ||| I am looking for books for my nieces and nephews and when I saw this book it brought a smile. I remember reading this to my kids when they were little, they just loved it. I highly recommend this book, it will be a favorite!
2 ||| I LOVE the wit and humour of these Canadian copycats, and THAT'S WHY I have been offended by the boldness of the issuing record company, who somehow neglected to dust off the vinyl from which they have copied most of the tracks for this CD. Furthermore, some of their transcriptions here are grossly distorted. I have heard better sounding bootlegs, of which this may well be the one!? In comparison, my Diamonds' original Australian MERCURY singles sound like master-tapes... Try UK import instead! Sometimes it is wiser to spend a bit more than to throw your money away.
2 ||| The product is heavier than I had wanted. The vibration is very strong even at the lowest speed, so if that is what you are looking for it is great.
1 ||| Thirteen Ghosts is about a machine. This machine was designed by a Man who was at the time possessed my Satan. Yes, Satan. If the plot doesn't seem stupid enough, it needs Ghosts to power it. Ghostbusters anyone? At the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a Michael J Fox movie. As time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts. If done right, it opens the 'Eye to Hell'.Save yourself a few bucks and don't rent this. It's awful
0 ||| The MP3 files downloadable from this site are not for Parsifal but Verdi's Traviata. Amazon needs to fix this urgently.
2 ||| How techno-tranced out can one get? Well, listening to Wink's "HereHear" will answer any curiosity you may have in regards to this question. The overlay of keyboards, sounds, and beats can hijack any listener's listening pleasure to an unsurpassed level into the musical mind of Wink. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails makes a vocal appearance on the track, "Black Bomb (Jerry in the Bag)", while Ursula Rucker soothingly delights you with her vocals on the track ,"Sixth Sense." Spaced out and trippy, yet yummy and satisfying.
1 ||| Compared to all other J&MC albums, this one stands out as the most banal and 2-dimensional.This album was produced by suits. End of story.There is no question that a reasonable album was cut in the studio and a bunch of remix jockeys massaged it into something that pandered to the lowest common denominator. Psychocandy had none of that and was a large commerical success - why the label decided that could not be replicated, I could not tell you.Muscially there are some very interesting elements in this work, but they have had all the rough edges sanded down. If you are looking for J&MC albums that are creative and push the edges of music, listen to Psychocandy and Munki.While I *do* enjoy listening to this album, keep in mind it is J&MC work in an "Elevator Music" warpper.Annoying and dissappointing.
4 ||| Because I can't see them in concert everyday this is a great CD to hold me over! Every time I buy this CD my whole house steals it to listen to it. Hence, this is the third time I have had to purchase it. If I needed to, I would purchase it again. This CD really speaks to the community without having to be vulgar or derogatory. It is all real talk! A great traveling CD...you won't skip a track!
1 ||| This is an extremely important topic, and it is interesting (even intriguing) to read Sanders' and Fackre's atypical views on this subject. However, Nash does not make a positive case -- WHICH IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Both Fackre and Sanders readily express their frustration with it, which can only lead the reader to exasperation. If you want to engage this issue, check this book out only for its bibliography. You also may want to read Fackre's argument as it is intriguing and well-written -- you'll never read First Peter again quite the same way...
2 ||| It's okay if you already like Tony and Carol from the TV show. There's not much to draw you in if not.
2 ||| The sound is terrible! I think the affects channel is on the right and the dialog on the left. The video quality is worse than VHS! How could Rhino do this to such a classic movie?
2 ||| Echo the same comments: + good raw material. Coverage on OO is very good, not just for Perl programmers but anyone interested in OO. One of the better intro to OO I've seen. - Yes, Index section sucks (editors are falling asleep on their jobs) - Yes, lots of errors (editors are falling...)Just by focusing on fixing the two minuses will make the next edition one of the better Perl books.Also, next to nothing in terms of coverage of OS interaction, networking, etc. Granted the book is pretty thick as it is, but calling it a "complete" reference is a bit of a stretch, IMO.
3 ||| To me Casting The First Stone is a story that covers many aspects of marriage, choices, actions, and consequences. The pastor of a prominent church has a wife and adoring daughter but it doesn't appear to be enough as he makes one reckless decision after enough that affects his life and his ministry. At times I found myself laughing at some of the drama that unfolded, but I must say by the time I read the last paragraph, I honestly felt sadness in my heart for the pastor. What happened to the Black family isn't anything I'd wish on anybody. They went thru much hell. I don't want to give the ending away but I think it's worth it for people to read, enjoy and maybe learn something from this story.
3 ||| this is great book for the trivia buffs. i purchase the book when it originally went into print. this is my third time buying an dreading the book and i am still discovering it.
1 ||| I spent most of this movie asking why this ship wasn't moving in heavy seas.Then I spent a few minutes yelling at it.Highly predictable "boo" factor here.Telegraphed from the off.I happen to like mindless entertainment late at night.Sometimes I just watch a stoopid movie.Ten Little Indians did it better.
4 ||| I ordered these for my little girl to sleep with at night. They are the perfect size for her and nice and soft. She loves sleeping with them and its great that it came with two in case she ever loses one.
2 ||| ... and music changes so did ZZ Top. This is not anymore the very blues they were famous for. I don't want every one of their CDs to be like this one.But anyway it's a CD that's just fun listening to.
1 ||| I was told by a close friend that this was her favorite book, so I was looking forward to reading it. When I came across it there was an insert saying "order the hard cover edition". Apparently people who have read this book want to read it again. I don't. I will admit that there were times when I really wanted to keep reading because I was waiting for something to happen. Eventually something did, then it got boring again. Ayn Rand has writing skills I could only wish to have, although it doesn't save the content. As I neared the end, determined to finish, I didn't think that John Galt's rant was ever going to end.
0 ||| I have already had one bit bend under normal use and I do not like how quickly these clog up.
0 ||| Until the action sequences and battle simulations, this thing plods. The script is very poor. Martin Sheen turns in another wooden portrayal. It had to be long to cover the three days of battle, but basically the only worthwhile aspect is the action, beginning with the struggle on Little Round Top. Using reenactors and authentic locations was about the only good idea at work in this thing. Despite all that, probably worth seeing, just for the action, and here and there some of the performances.
1 ||| When I first saw this movie, I was looking for a funny, romantic, movie full of laughter and romance. What I got - a few funny lines, and absolutly NO onscreen chemistry between Grant and Bullock. The plot was good, but it kind of dragged on a bit. The ending didn't hit home, and overall, the film wasn't very good. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, don't bet all your money on this one.
2 ||| Okay movie. nothing special. Effects are hokey, acting is bad (new jersey accents from canadian cops). But as for a certain scene with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree bagged-and-gagged (in which ropes obviously move around) Well, worth a few laughs or two.
4 ||| I first heard the bats ona little known surfmovie (or rather bodyboaring movie) called Blastoff. It had Black and Blue on it, whch is an amazing song and worth buying the entire album for, however the Blastoff tape also had "flotsam" on it, Flotsam is an amazing song as well. There is a beautiful harmony between the lead singers voice and a female background vocal. Give it a listen
4 ||| Preston Klik delivers once again! For all you My Scarlet Life fans, this new incarnation is even better, with great singing by Chandra Clark. Some of the tunes are trance inspiring, while some have a harder, more rythmic edge.

4 ||| I've been wearing these socks for years and, although they are a bit pricey, they're the best for wearing with athletic shoes.
3 ||| This is basically a Morbid Angel CD played at double speed..."Blizzard Beasts" is sort of a "transitional" CD for Immortal, combining the cold, frosty old-school black metal sound of "Battles in the North" and "Pure Holocaust" with the more crunchy well-produced death metal sound of later CD's as "At the heart of winter" and "Damned in black"Maybe "black metal puritans" will prefer the earlier CD's and new fans of Immortal prefer the new more polished, mid-tempo approach, but I think "Blizzard Beasts" is the perfect mix of the two, and therefore Immortal's best album in my oppinion..The almost Fields of the Nephilim sounding track "Mountains of might" is the album's highpoint, although it is the least representative, because the rest of the tracks are played at breakneck speeds!!Credit has to go to new drummer Horgh for his incredible stamina and energy, which seem to charge up the rest of the band.
3 ||| Unfortunately, I wish Santana would stick with the straight ahead latin stuff and not try to do something for everyone. Every song on here with the exception of the songs with Lauryn Hill (which is HORRIBLE) and the song Maria, Maria (which sounds like something Boys II Men would do..yuck!) are welcomed. Love of My Life (with Dave Matthews) is wonderful. Starts out funky and grooves right in to the latin sounds. Yaleo, which has been a concert favorite for years finally appears on an album. Smooth, is a nice Cha-Cha groove. (similar rhythms of Guajira and Oye Como Va).YES >>> There is a hidden track!!! It appears after "The Calling", which is track 13. It starts at 8 minutes into the same trach number. The song is called "Days of Celebration".If you have never bought a Santana album, this would be a great CD to pick up and then buy his other CD's. You won't regret it.
2 ||| A self-serving autobiographical reflection. In very few moments of this book does Norris step outside herself and her own "needs." Clearly, this is a woman who has too much time on her hands.
3 ||| Well, I must say, I have been reading several of these reviews and they seem pretty much the same: there are two ways to go: its boring or its incredible. For those who think that one must slug through this book do not have a very imagintative mind and won't allow themselves to explore the wonderful descriptions of nature and surprizing realistic chracteristics of the protagonoists. I do agree that the very beginning of the book is a bit trivial, but it sets up the rest of the story incredibly well. Of course, the other way is the ultimate 5 star way, which i would give to the other two books. the second half of this book is absolutely stunning while the later part of the first half gets really intersting as well. The only reason this book does not get 5 star is the slight slow start. Otherwise, if you cannot make it through that much are not a real fantasy fan, just a simple-minded moron.
3 ||| A 'must' have disc for true fans. This disc shows the real genius (both lyrical and muscially) of the Mael brothers. Symphonic versions of their classic tracks (This Town..., #1 Song in Heaven) add another dimensions to the muscial side of Sparks. However, i feel some tracks (Angst In My Pants, Popularity, and #1 Song...) redone with a dance feel were a waste of time. The reworking of the original wasn't worth the effort and added little to the interpretation of the song. Still, a must have for the true fan.
2 ||| This movie wasn't an all time great, funny in a few places. It does have Mark Calloway, The Undertaker, as the "bad guy."
2 ||| If you are thinking you are getting a bargain, you are. If you think you are getting high quality pans, you are mistaken. This leave me wanting my parents Calphalon set
2 ||| This book had some interesting and funny facts...got alittle lonnnnnnng, so it took awhile to get through it...it was okay
0 ||| I have used Pyrex for years and always thought these dishes were pretty durable. Today I bought a new one, filled it with cake mix at room temperature, and placed it in a 350 degree oven. It exploded about 15 minutes later, leaving shards of glass everywhere in a major league mess. After a Google search, I was shocked to find that there are numerous reports about exploding Pyrex. Apparently the official explanation has something to do with thermal shock, but why would you sell a dish for baking if it's subject to thermal shock? I'm swearing off the product and feel I must warn others.
0 ||| The movie is fine.....the other's that we tried to cancel have been charged to my credit card. This was a big mess and I don't think I will ever be able to clear it up. Never again....Syl
4 ||| I think her cd is moving and tuches me very much. I think she can sing very well and has a beautiful vocie. she is my idle and I admire her admiration.
0 ||| The mug looks stylish and, yes, it does not leak, but has two drawbacks:1. it's hand-wash only2. the lid is very hard to cleanafter using this mug for more than a year now I was foolish enough to take a screwdriver and disassemble the lid. The space between the seal and the top of the lid was absolutely disgusting, even though I had cleaned it regularly with a brush. Since I don't want to do a major maintenance job after every morning coffee I chucked the mug and reverted back to a cheapo mug I received as a gift earlier.
4 ||| ...I bought the Blancards' book at their restaurant after eating dinner there. I was absolutely mesmerized by the Blancards' hospitality in their restaurant. Melinda's writing equals her culinary experise. We love Anguilla, and their book gives a marvellous portrait of life there. Only one humongous problem...how can we keep this Caribbean paradise from becoming another Aspen? Books like this one, won't help. Already the "glitzeratti" have found the place. Keep this island paradise small, obscure and very difficult to get to...it took us all day and three planes to accomplish this. Love the place; love the book; love the Blanchard's.
1 ||| These microfiber clothes don't seem to actually pick up any dirt or dust (except in extreme cases). It looks and feels more like they simply push it around. I've been using them primarily as a cover for glass or plastic that I don't want scratched during transit.They're worth the price, if only for that purpose; if you actually need stuff cleaned, pick a different microfiber cloth.
0 ||| I really tried to get into this book. Sorry, I could not get past the shallow, dislikeable people and situations. Prose and symbolism are nothing if accompanied by a boring, unreadable plot. Maybe that is the point, but there are plenty of classic books that have it all: prose, symbolism, good plot, good characterizations, action, social commentary etc. It seemed like this book was an outline of a novel where the author sketched the main points, threw in some symbolism, then decided not to fill in the outline and create any depth to the story. Maybe that was the point, but it made the book really lacking. It does not require a thin, shallow book to portray thin, shallow people or times.
2 ||| The piece that the bra straps slides up & down used to be made of metal, but within the past couple of years Bali changed it to thin plastic that breaks within 5 washings if your're lucky. This basically ruins the bra,i've tried to gerryrig something, forget it. Bali does not sell any replacement pieces or fix it kits. So far the only thing I found was a store on the internet & so far having a difficult time ordering from them.Needless to say, I am VERY disappointed! For about 15 years this was MY bra, lmost knew this bra down to the serial number, devoted! Unfortunately Bali doesn't share the same feeling, seems like they are only interested in shortening the life of there product so they can sell more.Know I have to look for another bra that's similar, hopefully it's made a little bit better than this one.
1 ||| Fallen is IMO one of the best albums ever -- a rare one where I find all the tracks enjoyable. I'm still far from fully understanding why I don't like The Open Door nearly as much, but there's one thing I noticed, and that's that I have to strain to understand what Amy Lee is singing. This is probably a major part of it. In Fallen I could enjoy the words, and I could enjoy her voice. In The Open Door it's all somehow drowned, by either the music or the effects, or at times it just seems she's whispering. In Fallen her voice was also overlayed with stuff, but at least she seemed to make an effort to rise above it, or perhaps whoever edited it seemed to realise that her voice should be heard.
3 ||| I just had to respond to the reader who panned this book: do you own a dog? This is a VERY funny book! And well done. Murphy, like many dogs and their humans had gotten into the habit of too many calories and too little exercise. To view the storyline as a case of "society's...reverence of appearance above all else" and to equate Cheryl's conduct with "humilia[ion] by forced exercise or dieting" is a major case of the reader projecting HER issues on Murphy! He's a dog: he lives to eat, sleep AND please his alpha dog, Cheryl. And Cheryl, like any good alpha dog (or parent, for that matter) is using positive discipline and proactive behavior to mold her protege into the best--and healthiest--dog he can be.My kids love this book! And they don't see the negative messages that the CA reader does; they see a funny story about an owner's creative way to help her dog get healthier.
0 ||| When you have a kid on the autism spectrum that isn't talking/developing appropriately, sometimes things work out OK on their own. That's pretty much a summary of this book's contents.However, all too often, they do not work out on their own, and any parent that buys this book because their child isn't talking/developing appropriately, and decides to do nothing or delay testing and treatment, is making a regrettable mistake.True, some kids talk late and turn out fine. But all too many don't, and even children that are "on the borderline" can fall far, far behind unless Parents make an effort to address the situation.Early intervention is key in helping kids on the Autism spectrum. If you're worried about your child, go ahead and purchase this book, but look at OTHER books on the matter, and think carefully about what you need to do to ensure your child's needs are fully met.
0 ||| This has to be the worst Bond of them all! (The only reason I even have it is because I got the complete Bond set and apparently you can no longer get them individually).Here's an example of how bad and unbeleavable the story is:in one instance, he's seducing numerous patients at Blowfelds clinic, the next we're supposed to believe he's in love with Tracey? Give me a break.
0 ||| I have yet to meet a child who has actually seen a sardine, much less eaten one. This book, from concept to execution, is one of the worst examples of the picture book format I have ever seen, and, being a librarian, I've seen plenty. Despite what other reviewers have written, most children will not find humor or comfort in the story and will not be "uplifted" by the illustrations. Kids are "uplifted" by COWS IN THE KITCHEN or DOUBLE TROUBLE IN WALLA WALLA, not by the death of a fish. The book is dark, ugly and pretty much a waste of a tree.
2 ||| The thank you song is by Dido on her No Angel album. It is entitled "Thank You". I hope this helps. :)
1 ||| The idea is really nice, but I wish the walls are longer and thicker. When I received it, once side was down and after months it's still down. I couldn't get the mold to go back in shape or to get the wall to stay up.
3 ||| this book was about a boy named max who meets a crippled boy.they go on adventures together so they call there self freak the mighty.but one day max's dad killer kane broke in and took max.so freak saved max by finding them in an abanded building ....i recommend this book to anyone.and my favorite character was max.
0 ||| I use the foot spa infrequently, primarily for helping to recover from foot surgery.I've had the unit for over a year, but have used it only about 6 times (and being careful not to add anything to the water per the directions).This morning, I pulled it out, filled it with warm water, plugged it in and started it up in anticipation of helping a foot recover from another, recent operation. The unit worked for about 5 minutes and then the air pump quit functioning properly, making only a clicking sound and providing no air jet flow.The only advice from Brookstone customer service is to take it to a repair shop.I am extremely disappointed that such an expensive unit has failed and requires repair after just 6 uses.
1 ||| Sorry, but I was expecting more. Save for the part where the ghost is sitting next to him on the couch, this didn't have that suspense that I was looking for. It definitly ranks way behind "the others" and "sixth sense". The acting isn't too bad, which makes it watchable, but there's just not much to it.
4 ||| I remember this from my early teens. This is comfort food on celluoid. I have the vhs version and wouldnt give it up for any fancy DVD or super duper Blu-Ray version. There is an ambience with vhs that is lost in digital. I have stacked duel vcr players plus a back up built in the TV. Anyway get the movie and be a kid again-good stuff!!
0 ||| I had this installed on our car seat thinking it was a great product. I then went to a car seat check point and was told by the technician checking the seat that these were very dangerous. They removed it and got the seat just as tight without it. Highly recommned not buying. If you take your car seat to most fire stations or police stations (call ahead), most are happy to assist in getting the seat in correctly and snugly!!!
4 ||| I gave this DVD to one of my God-daughters as a Christmas gift. We watched it with the whole family and we all enjoyed seeing the movie. It is nice for young children to see and learn the battle between good and evil and watch good to prevail.
3 ||| This album was recorded on various days and at various locations between June and July 1980. Billy was promoting his GLASS HOUSES album. He and his band decided to tape a few concerts from the tour and release some live performances of his pre-STRANGER material. We start with a TURNSTILES track,MIAMI 2017(Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway),recorded at New York City's famous Madison Square Garden. Also recorded there was THE BALLAD OF BILLY THE KID. With this album,SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD,originally a TURNSTILES track,became a hit. So did a COLD SPRING HARBOR track,SHE'S GOT A WAY. The album also contains songs from PIANO MAN and STREETLIFE SERENADE. Each title gives its own date and location of recording. Too bad ANGRY YOUNG MAN was not used for this album. Another TURNSTILES track that would be later recycled for Billy's next live album KOHUEPT. There should have been PIANO MAN on this album also.
3 ||| I got this for my 4 year old because she wanted to play with her daddy. the guns are fine but the belt was huge still she has funn using ti for dress up it was a good buy.
2 ||| Overall for the price this is a decent DVD player that does what it's advertised to do. Picture and sound quality are good and being able to watch divx encoded discs is nice. The only real problem is that it it's SLOW, it can take up to 30 seconds to start up and another 20 seconds or more to load a DVD. It can be very, very annoying. If you can live with the sluggish interface then overall it's a good DVD player for the price.
3 ||| This is a delightful and character-driven program full of wonderful historical perspectives not usually seen on television. After watching the interviews and art director's run-through of how the shows were shot, I was even more impressed with the inventiveness of the crew's and the book author's careful conveyance of forensic history's development in the industrialization of the New World. I'm buying the rest of the series and hope that the funding keeps coming for more shows. This is a must-see for the history-ignorant youth of today.
1 ||| The writing in this book makes it painfully clear why the author endured the abuse described just for the chance her demanding boss would pull some strings for her and help the author get a job as a writer--she has no talent. Anyone who actually can write would have enough confidence in her ability to get a job based on merit rather than enduring the humiliation described in the novel. The characters are undeveloped and Andrea comes across as a whining, self-centered, insecure brat who expects everyone around her to feel sorry for her but who has no interest in anyone but herself.If you have a lot of time on your hands, you may find the stories about Miranda mildly entertaining; however, if your time is precious to you, this is not a worthwhile book.
4 ||| I had this music in album form when it first came out and it was super deserving of 5 stars or better. Wished I could find it again.
3 ||| Blood, Sweat & Tears frontman David Clatyon-Thomas' first solo release in 20 years takes a decidedly different turn. With "Blue Plate Special", DCT gets back to the music of his youth, his musical roots - straight ahead blues.On the opening cut, "Too Many Dirty Dishes", David shows right away how comfortable he is with this material. There are some other excellent covers as well, "Hoochie Koochie Man" and "Hard Times" Some of the best material, though is David's own rocker "Wish the World Would Come To Memphis" and "Suzy Got Her Big Hair On".Two cuts, "Drown in My Own Tears" and "Lucretia MacEvil", both have been recorded before by Clayton-Thomas and should have been left alone.Let me be clear on this, this is not a Blood, Sweat & Tears album. You won't find the rich horns on most cuts or the pop hooks. If you are looking for BS&T sound, then by BS&T's collection "What Goes Up". But for David Clayton-Thomas singing the blues, then this is the CD to get.
2 ||| Released as one of a series of CDs dedicated to the "Songs of Bob Dylan" (See another in this series under The Byrds), this CD offers wonderful interpretations by a band that was one of Dylan's greatest interpreters. Both Jerry and Bobby have time and again dug into the Dylan treasure chest for material that they molded into their own seemingly without effort. Why only three stars, then? Well, there are just too many tracks from the Brent-tinkling-on-the-DX7-synth era for my taste. I've seen and heard the Dead play Dylan from the Keith-and-Donna incarnation, through the Brent years, to Dylan and the Dead (at JFK Stadium in Philly no less), and even the Vince and whoever else joined him on keys last lineup. So ... I wish this particular collection would or could have dug out performances from a deeper vault. Finally, check out the Jerry Garcia-Merle Saunders "Live at the Keystone" CD's for some excellent Dylan interpretations. Happy trails!
2 ||| I really liked this book for the first 2/3rds of it. Great story, did dry up a little towards the end, otherwise I was kept interested until the last 1/3rd of the book. Ursula has a great writing style that's worth mentioning. I guess I was just expecting something much more sinister based on the title of the book. If I had not had this expectation would it have been different? Possibly.
0 ||| i cant believe you people would pay money to get this cd. the only good song on the cd is "did you ever think" (feat. nas), and the only reason it's any good is because of nas. if you don't have this cd, use your money on a nas, 2pac or other good RAP cd.
2 ||| the chi-lites were known for their early 70s masterpieces HAVE YOU SEEN HER and OH GIRL. there's a lesser hit called A LETTER TO MYSELF which really borrows a lot from their first big hit. and theres a few more sound a likes since they thought it was a winning formula. they never reached the heights of groups like the o'jays, stylistics, spinners and the like. i bought this for a very minor hit since i had the three previous hits. a song called MY HEART KEEPS ON BREAKING. it was so long ago but i remember really liking it. surprise surprise when i heard it again. it was a real stab at country for them. its funny to hear it now. the cd is nicely remastered and the booklet and liner notes are extensive and there might be another gem or two i didnt mention.
0 ||| I bought this clock based upon the Seiko name. I've had two Seiko watches and found the quality to be outstanding. I was very disappointed to see that this is a CHEAP plastic clock. It is not "metallic" as described in the website. We sent it back.
3 ||| Yes, I could have bought a plain old plastic recorder for my 2 year old son to play with, but once I saw these adorable and brightly colored instruments, I had just had to have one! I also ordered another and gave it to my friend, who has a son five months older than mine. Music is such an important part of childhood development and this darling recorder is the perfect way to celebrate that notion! One drawback, however is if you have a young child, who likes to throw things, this recorder may chip a little, since it's wooden and not plastic. It's nothing serious- just a little chip off some of the paint. When I see my son pick this up and blow into it like the "pied piper" to make a "melody", I crack up!!! Also, lots of speech therapists use items such as these to exercise muscles in the mouth that are imperative for talking...
2 ||| This Movie was ok, you can tell it was done by horror fans who tribute alot of horror films in this movie. If you know anything about horror movies you will get the little clues in the movie. I enjoyed this movie, it was fun and a good waste of time. I wouldn't watch it again though. The makeup in this movie is really bad, but it goes along with the feel of the movie. The acting sucks too. It's still an enjoyable film though. If you haven't seen it I suggest that you do for a good waste of time.
1 ||| This is more typical garbage that the industry keeps producing.......anyone notice its tougher and tougher to find good rap cds,theres maybe5-6 a year now....thats LAME...everyone go buy the black album
1 ||| For all those who have yet to buy this movie, WAIT!!!I know many have criticized the DVD release as it is the shorter, general release and NOT the memorable "Roadshow" edition complete with Overture, Intermission, and over 25 minutes of deleted scenes.The film is currently being worked on up in Canade. It is one of the last surviving prints left in existence. Supposedly, it will be released sometime next year on DVD and Blu-Ray. GOOGLE IT!!!In the meantime, add a couple other John Wayne films to your list until the NEW and IMPROVED version arrives.
0 ||| This is a good pillow if you do NOT plan to breastfeed. The pillow doesnt stay around your waste if you want to sit comfortably. I find that in order to breastfeed my son i have to lean foreward so far that it hurts. It is just too bulky and firm for brestfeeding. The star is for helping my son sit up. However it does tend to slide back away from him. This pillow is also too bulky for tummy time. My advice is to buy a cheaper one if you feel you need one. Or buy one with toys attached, even better is the gym model, which I plan to get after I return this useless pillow. Think about this: $34 for about $3 worth of material and stuffing.
3 ||| This is a very pointed look at a young woman's descent into psychosis. Plath is a blunt author and there are many questions as to if this book is an autobiography. The main character, Esther, uses many aliases (aliai?) and tells a story that lines up quite well with that of Mrs.Plath. This was a required reading book this year at school for me, but I will tell you this. I read it over the summer and liked it-but I enjoyed it more this time around. This is a powerful book and is written with a lot of well thought out imagery and symbolism. If you have seen the movie Girl, Interupted or read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest you will find this book of interest. But if you have a light stomach beware in the last three or so chapters. One of my all time favorites!
1 ||| I am about 2/3 of the way through this book and went on line to determine if I should even bother to finish reading it. These sceenes are so muddied and boaring. No-one goes through this much mental anguish for 4 to 5 books. Anita had a personality before she had to start second guessing herself all the time, where did it go? PS. LKH, editors, publishers, why should anyone else spell check their work, it you can print books with this many errors.
2 ||| The author presents vision improvement in a way that likens relaxed use of the eyes to other forms of fitness that keep the body, or various aspects of it, working smoothly and efficiently. The material isn't strictly the Bates Method, but it's basically in line with it, with some things added that some Bates teachers may not agree with. The book goes over why glasses are not the solution, then it gets into specific exercises that are to help refractive errors.
2 ||| the book came in an acceptable condition, the description should have been a little more detailed as to how old this book really was but overall shipping was quick and the book was only 4$, so I cant complain
3 ||| This does not have anything that the Informix manuals do not have if you look long and hard enough. It does however cover a lot of ground in a very easy to read form. As a DBA familiar with online v7. this was money I do not regret spending at all !
1 ||| I had bought this movie a few years ago and never watched it until recently.I was disappointed by the plot and by the characters, the premise itself is fascinating.The premise is that this unlikely black angel (Belafonte) comes to this suffering Jewish man (Mostel) and his wife and tries to get him to believe in the angel. The theme of a man's need to believe in something resonates.But the plot goes in a different direction, much of it is about the angel. And the language is often harsh and the movie itself resembles The Pawnbroker in its cynical and harsh view of New York life at that time.Mostel is perfect, I believe every word and action of him. Belafonte would be a great choice as the angel if the plot eliminated the earthiness and self-pitying of his character and stressed the idea of him as an angel. As for the rest of the cast, Milo O'Shea as a Jewish doctor?
1 ||| Lews book was not helpful in the fact that it did not offer any such information on how to write the screenplay. INSTEAD he concentrated on charecter development and night and day senerios. Most of us know how to tell a story. We just want the information and facts to help us delever our thoughts in the screenplay format.
3 ||| I use this for both washing/rinsing and spinning my leafy produce. (For washing, I just fill the bowl with water, swish around the greens, then lift the inner basket to drain, and repeat.) It's sturdy and easy to clean. (It takes up a lot of room in the drainer, but I can't really see a way around that for a spinner this size.) I don't use it for storing produce because it takes up too much room in the fridge; I transfer to a bag for storage. I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I've been satisfied with my purchase.
0 ||| Beware! Four minutes are missing from the Ballad Medley. It should be 11 minutes long, not 7. This is one of the best songs on the album, which is why you can't buy it by itself. So, I bought the whole album only to discover that it's an MP3 Amputee. I hope Amazon will refund my money.
4 ||| I purchased both the "remastered" import versions of Surrealistic Pillow and Crown of Creation. Both CDs have bonus tracks and it has been claimed that each has been digitally remastered. However, if you study both the CD and the accompanying insert, there is no statement whatever to suggest that these CDs are remastered. Though listening tests are subjective, neither of these CDs sounded superior in audio quality. The widely available recent U.S. reissue of Surrealistic Pillow--including stereo and mono versions of both songs but no bonus tracks--actually claims to be remastered (e.g., note info on audio restoration & digital transfers) and sounds superior to the European import w/ bonus tracks.
4 ||| If you want your 9 year old to read, give him something that he won't want to put down. My grandson loves this book.
0 ||| This is one of those movies that I have walked out of and all I could think was "Why????""How could they take a sweet story and corrupt it this way? I have sat many a night with my children, reading this story over and over. They absolutely love Seuss.This movie is visually spectacular, but does not hold true to the spirit of Dr. Seuss. It is not approptiate for young children. It is Austin Powers dressed up like the Cat in the Hat. The need to throw in improper innuendos in a film that should be for children and families is just sad. The rating for this movie should be PG-13. If the studios feel the need to add adult bits to a film, then please don't target my kids!
1 ||| Amateur totally unprofessional home video, sloppy production.Strikes against this video are as follows:Amateur video production.poor sound qualitypoor close ups of foot workcamera bounces around so much I got dizzynonprofessional dance teammistakes are NOT edited out.the small Blue room, blue walls, blue floors, and blue ceilings make one feel closed in.Apparently, this group of dancers are the people of a local synagogue and they are just having fun - as they do on Shabbat. They are just - well, regular folks - all ages.Pros:Kids can learn most of the circle dances.They do cover lots of different dance steps in real time and slow motion.It has a good running time of 90 minutesBottom line: If you can look past the amature production and just work on the steps and if youcan get it for half the price, it would be worth it.
1 ||| I chose to buy these night lights over others because one reviewer stated that the night light started off dim when room begins to get dark and gets brighter as the room gets darker. This is not the case. The night light is either on or off. There is no gradual brightening as the room gets darker. If that is what you are looking for, don't get these. Aside from that disappointment, they are fine.
2 ||| I read this because some science fiction critic said it was "better than Robinson Crusoe."Not quite."I am Legend" is a pretty compelling metaphor for isolation (and isolationism), but the author lets a lot of that tension run to waste by devoting the middle portion of the story to a bogus Freudian/science-fictional explanation of where the vampires came from, why crosses repel them, blah blah blah...I suppose it's an important contribution to the evolving vampire mythos (though I'm not sure that's a good thing if "Twilight" is what we get from it), but it could have been something even better: a truly atmospheric story throughout. That, to me, would have been even more valuable.
0 ||| I recieved my first issue today. It is the June issue, which hit news stands 6 weeks ago. I would have preferred my first issue be a new issue rather than one that was printed 6 weeks ago. Who needs Father's Day recipes in the middle of July?
2 ||| There's a lot to like about this 2-player spin-off of Settlers of Catan (which I love). The knights have unique capabilities and even names. All those city improvements from Cities & Knights now actually do specific things (related to what the buildings are; for example, the aquaduct makes you immune to plagues). And, or course, it allows two people to enjoy Catan when a third isn't available.However, by design, this game is only for two players, and sometimes that can be a problem, because once one person gets ahead by just 2-3 points (it takes 12 to win), it's pretty much over. One of the beauties of the original Catan was the balance provided by having 3-4 players. When one got ahead, the other two could often "gang up" on him to balance out the score. In this game, it's more difficult to do that.
2 ||| It's small, which is what I wanted. But the steel is thin. This thing pops and crackles like crazy on an electric stove as the steel heats up, even on medium. And the "whistle" is barely audible. I'll be keeping an eye out for something better.
3 ||| It's good enough for me to order volume 2 after having this for a few months. It's the arcade versions of some good oldies. So if u want some good old games to kick around with your friends in 2 player mode and having endless continues to win every time, you are in the right place. To be fair, about half of the games i don't play at all, and were boring the one time i did play them. However, the other half... worth the money easily.
1 ||| Okay, I'm giving this product two stars instead of one because it was the best eye mask ever unntil it started falling apart. The lining eventually peels apart from the foam. I still wear mine even with the flopping lining, but I am in need of a new mask now. Bummer because the product is EXCELLENT until the lining starts peeling. :(
1 ||| I ordered the DVD from Amazon based on the description given. The DVD I received did not contain the original version of the film, as was advertised, only the black & white version. This quote is from the Amazon.com description; "This DVD does not provide a working replica of the Illusion-O viewer (earlier copies did), but it offers both a straight, black-and-white version of the feature (no viewer necessary) and a version with the film's original tinted scenes requiring the viewer for extra fun. Also included is Castle's own introduction, in which he explains the Illusion-O technique. --Tom Keogh". I don't care about the viewer, I'm interested in the original tinted scenes.
2 ||| Since the story is a mixture of espionage and romance, a lot of names are revealed. I had to reread the passages in order to keep track of them. So this is not something you'd want to read in bed. Damien and Emma are the faint reminiscences of what Ryman's other characters have been. However, the dialogues are too played out, and the exposition is a bit shaky. I still don't get the love-hate relationship between them. But overall, Ryman's curry-like description will work like magic.
2 ||| I too have read the WoT series and I confess that I am hooked! This last book seemed to be like the last two. They are starting to get bogged down somewhat. Too many little characters and too much detail on trival stuff. The story line needs to start moving to a finish. I worry that something might happen to Robert Jordan and that the series will NEVER be completed. Please Mr. Jordan, let's get this "show on the road".
2 ||| Nice video with semi-amatuer camera shots. Suprise appearance from Michael Stipe (REM) for Kid Fears. Has bits of personal interviews. This video shows The Girls in an intimate light.
2 ||| This album has a lot of ups and downs. I rarely ever play it all the way through. They have quite a few hits on this album such as Live and Let Die, November Rain, Don't Cry, and a few others. The most underrated song as this album would be the final track Coma.
0 ||| Has this guy even studied history? I don't even know where to begin. But I know where to end - the book is awful. I had to give it one star, because zero isn't an option.
2 ||| I previously rated the Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info.there. This trap looks good and should work, but it didn't catch any mice. Setting the trap doors is a little tricky.
2 ||| full of textures, incredible drumming , huge bass riffs and a voice that did not seem annoying to me. Any bozzio fan will like it. I liked a lot.Do not believe even in my own review before you listen to it.
1 ||| I guess I need to look a little closer at what I'm looking to check out in the future when it comes to non-fiction, as this was aimed just a LITTLE bit below my comprehension.The biggest issue with the book is that rather than presenting the facts of the various matters in a strictly historical context the author makes sure to point out how each of the individuals that had been involved in the various hoaxes - unwittingly or not - was either 1) a Snidely Whiplash-esque villain, twisting his or her mustache as the marks fell for the con, or 2) a grade a moron.In theory it wouldn't be a bad primer for this sort of thing, but you could easily glean more information from Wikipedia about each of the cases in question.
3 ||| This is the first GPS that I have been able to use. I purchased a Magellan Triton several years ago but it was so user unfriendly, it is still in the box. I have been able to use the odometer, track my path so far. The downloading of maps and installing in my GPS my prove to be VERY difficult according to reviews, hints, advice. Good luck.
3 ||| I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!
0 ||| I just did some research on-line of the Henri Young at Alcatraz facts. Go to Alcatrazhistory.com and see for yourselves that this movie was a COMPLETE fabrication of the truth. The movie claims that it was "inspired" by the true story of Henri Young, which is a slick way of trickery for which Hollywood is famous. Having said that, the acting and direction is very good; but the false propaganda by the liberal communist Left makes this film yet another slap in the face of the truth.
2 ||| In this story, Hyacinth is a woman who is faced with one of the most horrible moments in a mother's life: she is forced to give up her two children for a moment of craziness she already regrets.Faced with an incredible emptiness, she is able, with the help of a total stranger, to rebuild her life. what once seemed an impossibility becomes her career and she is good at it.The story is interesting and the plot keeps you interested till the end. It makes a good summer reading.
3 ||| The Booklist review of this book brings up a good point. It says: [Ancestors of Avalon is] one that telescopes the evocative notion that the otherworldly forces supporting Arthur were remnants of Atlantis.There is another series of books that supports the Atlantis/Arthur connection. The Pendragon Cycle books by Stephen R. Lawhead are a series of well-written books that Zimmer Bradley fans would also enjoy.
2 ||| Apartment 26 is such a different sound then im used to. Its like jazzy rock with scremo, its kinda wierd like nothing else (especially give me more). Nevertheless it is a good cd, the songs on this are so much different from the next song, the songs that i like are strike, stupid world has to be one of the worst beginnings to a song and the following 2 songs are just to jazzy for me. Continuing on New Years Resolution, and Kick to the head are great great songs. Followed by one of the worst songs summer.The only thing that I can think of is like a rollercoaster ride. some ups and some downs over and over. Its an alright cd, but theres only three songs that stand out to me, the others are garbage.
2 ||| The movie industry is the draw and an incredibly odd collection of characters find themselves living marginalized lives in the shadow of early Hollywood. Their lives interact in a series of bizarre scenes fueled primarily by lust for the one female character who is completely self-absorbed and has somehow transformed the attention from men she encounters into her own fanasy version of celebrity.There is a dark undertone of violence that finally erupts in a random and surprising way that sems to be a rebellion against the perversion of reality that Hollywood represents.Not a great book..but a memorable one.
0 ||| Viewed: 7/05Rate: 27/05: Oh, no. Another sequel of Child's Play. There is nothing new with Child's Play 3. It's just boring as hell, and the picture is stupid as bananas. All in all, there is nothing good to say about Child's Play 3, really.
0 ||| i don't know about you, but when i heard "he wasn't man enough for me" i thought the rest of the album would be just as good if not better, and that at list there will be some tracks which will be "single honored", but... I WAS WRONG! the album ..., and exepct from 3 songs, which are a bit upbeat and fast paced, the rest is mostly ballads, boring ones, and non of them seem to be as a single... unless you love this kind of music, or you are a toni fan, don't buy this album. instead, by survivor by destiny's child! ( a great album!!!!!)
1 ||| This book is not worth the time to read. The plot is convoluted and unbelievable, the characters are not interesting, and the horses (ponies) are poorly delineated. I gave it every chance, but got so bored with it I started skipping pages madly less than a third of the way into it. Even for confirmed horse-lovers (me, for one), the book rates low. Good grief, horses just do NOT act in the manner described! Who ever heard of a "wild" stallion leading a person to a foal's grave and pawing it up? It just doesn't happen that way, folks. Do yourself a favor...pick some other book to read at the beach.
0 ||| I purchased one of these kettles a couple of years ago and generally like it, especially the spout that opens automatically when you pour. However the whistle is not durable. I sent my first two back to OXO due to the whistle failing. They graciously replaced the units with new ones, the second of which had a new design for the whistle. However, it too failed within a couple of months. I have followed the directions of not filling the kettle with too much water and only using medium heat to no avail.I have an electric stove so I have not had the handle-heating problem that others have mentioned.I cannot recommend this kettle as I feel it is dangerous to not have the whistle function properly.
3 ||| This is one of those collaborations that pretty much sounds like just what it is. Ian McKaye of Fugazi fronting Ministry. As a longtime fan of both bands just the thought is exciting. The songs are too. Basically just a 6 track Ep, it's enough...but not too much. Trait is a real sound of the times. I'm not sure I can sell this any better than telling you who's involved.This entire release and more is also found on the Ministry collection "Side Trax". Can't confirm that it's remastered, but it might be more for your money.
0 ||| I am sorry but I was never able to appreciate this book. I found the plot boring, the characters uninteresting and no ingenious ideas whatever. It was not unconvincing; there simply wasn't anything to grab your attention. Moreover, I thought the style a bit similar to the unfeelingness of cyberpunk -- and since I take great delight in fantasy, cyberpunk is the last thing I'd like a fantasy book to remind me of. The problem is that I read "Lords of the Sky" immediately after Zelazny's Amber series -- how is it possible to rate these two works equally? (Also, if it is REALLY better than the rest of Wells' books, you'll have to introduce negative values on your rating scale.)Anyway, you should try it (as well as any other book) yourself. Judgements are always subjective; and tastes vary extremely.
2 ||| The Abominable Snowman is in a somewhat different vein from much of the Hammer films of this period. It aims to be more philosophical rather than horrific and comes across more as a long (too long) Twilight Zone or original Star Trek episode (particularly as the Himalayas looked much like a snowish covered version of the planets in which the crew always seemed to find themselves) which is not what one is necessarily looking for in what was once a feature film. The actors, particularly, of course, Peter Cushing, do good work and the film has nice intentions in its message but the slow build-up to the story is unnecessary when the time could have been used more effectively to develop the secondary characters and give a litte more back story to the leads, if not actually creating suspense. Not the best work from a great studio.
1 ||| This looked good on the site but for a van, it did not fit well enough to travel. There were 6 adults going on a two week driving trip and we could not make the saddlebag fit well enough to feel safe with it on the back of my Toyota Sienna van. It also rubbed against the back (just trying to install it) and I will need to have the lift door buffed to bring it back to the original look.SUV's may be better for this piece of equipment.
0 ||| How can one write a review for something that we have not received nor do we have a new ship date. We have been waiting for this grill for almost 3 months. Plus, we cannot find a way on Amazon to contact a human body to get more information on our order. PLEASE HELP111
0 ||| This book is intended for beginners, or so it seems - but it doesn't explain things with sufficient clarity. Examples are given sparingly. When they are offered, they are not explained thoroughly. So this book fails miserably as a beginners' text. By chapter 3 or 4, you'd be screaming for help.If this book is intended for more advanced users, it covers too much of beginners' stuff. It won't appeal to this group of users either.So for whom is this book written? I don't know. Don't waste your money on this one.
2 ||| Run for cover is the last HARD ROCK album of Gary moore before he released the not great at all Wild Frontier(too much Keyboards)and then went back to his roots:the blues.On this album Gary Moore shares the vocals with Glenn Hughes and Phil Lynott, which is certainly good news, it also features Phil Lynott's last recordings OUT IN THE FIELDS and MILITARY MAN.Run for cover contains very good HARD ROCK songs, strongly re-enforced by Moore's brilliant guitar job, but most of the tracks on this album are NO MORE than good HARD ROCK and I probably expected more from Moore, Lynott and Hughes.Also a "remake" of Empty rooms, quite useless.Not a bad album but weaker than Victims of the future, corridors of power or Dirty Fingers.3 and 1/2 stars would be a better rate...so yes depending on the fact that you already own a previous HARD MOORE album or not, that would be a 3 or 4 stars.
3 ||| Wonderful CD from the wonders of jazz. Hey, that would be a good title for an album. Very mellow. Not exciting. Just mellow.
2 ||| Honestly, I give this album, 3.5 stars. I was kinda dissapointed with Sleepy lyrically, but he makes up for it with beats and catchy phrases. I love the live instruments, being that every song is not computer generated. I don't know, I just thought that him being around the likes of Outkast and Goodie Mob would exert some influence lyrically, but the lyrics are nothing profound. All in all, I like the album, reminds me of a pimp soundtrack, lol, easy on the ears, his vioce reminds me of Marvin Gaye on some songs. Some of my favorites are I'm Soul and Sunday Morning
0 ||| [This review notes a problem with the Hesperus Press Kindle edition. It is not a review of the book itself.]Hesperus Press offers the most expensive Kindle edition of "The Tragedy of Korosko". Unfortunately, the work delivered is "Through the Magic Door", a long essay in which Conan Doyle ruminates about his favorite writers. The substitution is surely inadvertent. A review seemed like the best way to call it to the publisher's attention and in the meantime warn prospective buyers.
1 ||| There are a few issues with this set that make others more worthwhile (for reference, my kids are 6 and 7):1. When you add a shoot/funnel/anything other than the one-piece cylinder building pieces, you have to add 2 more clear pieces. Other sets would have a single piece that can be built upon. This doesn't, and you have a lot more work building as a result.2. The structure tends to be less than sturdy (not quite flimsy, but not as solid as other similar toys).3. The yellow spirals have a poor design. You have to add in small support pieces that don't snap into place. I believe this is so the spirals would take less space when in a box (they flatten out), but there are extra pieces you have to keep track of as a result. Not a fan.Overall, I'd suggest buying a different set.
0 ||| don't waste your time and money on this film. val kilmer made this film sound like it was the only film worth watching this year. i'll just say you're not missing anything. what was a good story line was turned into mediocre ... it was even fragmented, ... bad directing, ... [the lead actor] was trying too hard to be something he wasn't. he isn't made for a role like this. ... ...
3 ||| I think this is a great soundtrack companion to a pretty good movie. "Shine your light," played at the end of the movie, is an amazing and pretty powerful song, and the rest are pretty good too.
3 ||| here's a little story. once upon a time a girl named kaycie went to a newsboys concert. she had pretty bad seats that were almost all the way in the back. well kaycie got a little upset. she grabbed her friend jade by the arm and dragged her to the front. after much moshing, crowd surfing, and pushing kaycie made it to the very front of the crowd. she was so close that the newsboys' bassist waved to her. after that concert kaycie definately recommends this cd.
2 ||| The significance of this Battle of Midway as a turning point in the Pacific war is brought home to the viewer. The acting os good (for the era) and the integrated battle film clips are well presented. I give is just a 3-star rating simply in comparision to more modern film production and acting techniques. For a WWII history buff, though, it is an important film to watch.
3 ||| Scriven is one of the "grandfathers" of evaluation and it does provide background that quite a number of writers refer to. One of the three copies I ordered had a price tag stuck to the cover that was difficult to remove; one price label was impossible to remove; one cover was in pristine condition.Don
3 ||| I ordered these because they would go in the dishwasher. I do not like to put wooden spoons through because they dry out and crack. These work well, have not melted at all, and seem to come clean very easily.The only reason I did not give these a 5 star rating is that the larger spoon is *really big* and has a very thick handle. I still use it when I use my large soup pot, but I find the small size is much handier.
2 ||| I bought this one expecting it to be as amusing as "Regular guys" or "Balls". Unfortunately, it's not.Don't read the comments on the cover cause they have barely something to do with the film.I laughed maybe once or twice. Of course there are more funny moments, but they'd rather make you smile than laugh along loud.Acting is good, but the action is rather slow, at least during the first half of the film.To sum up: not bad, but Germans can do better :)
1 ||| I admired Lutz's throughness in accruing examples, and there are many interesting sidebars and historical illustrations, but there's almost no point to this book at all. It reads somewhat like Marjorie Garber's latest works, except it's even more "lite"--it's as if he had been so busy finding things to discuss relative to tears that he forgot to spend time actually discussing what sorrow and sentiment and sentimentality actually mean.
4 ||| What an amazing and funny show, much like Arrested Development and Family Guy (just to name the obvious) it didnt make it. Family guy has rebounded. Clone High ended way to early to have a chance to do anything. Regardless, I really want to have these episodes at home to enjoy, it's a fun way to see western adolescent culture roles intertwined with some of histories must influential and important people. Original and funny, pretty well Why it didnt have a chance.
3 ||| I use this book in my children's psychiatric inpatient groups as an intro to our lesson on remembering things that feel good and give pleasure. They love talking about the pleasures they have experienced and recalling that there is happiness in their lives....positive psychology approach.
1 ||| I have read everything in the Corps series and loved the first few. Griffin came up with a unique style that educates the reader on the details of military life through the stories of a number of interesting and heroic characters with comic relief provided by an occasional cowardly and/or incompetant martinet. Griffin should go back to WWII where there is much left to be told. The Korea books are not up to standard and make the personalities of the heroes redundant, boring, ridiculous, and parodies of themselves. Has anybody ever considered the similarities of Griffin's books to Star Trek? The main characters never die, just the ones new to the current episode! Or are they like Buck Rogers in which the hero goes off on harrowing missions every week and ends up back at headquarters lauded as the conquering hero once again? The funniest thing of all is that Griffin still has me hooked and I will buy the next installment (in paperback, of course)!
2 ||| After I first started watching the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer I decided I liked the show so much I wanted to buy the seasons on DVD so I bought the first season and also since this is the movie that started it all I decided to buy the DVD for the theatrical movie and I watched it and While I agree with the comments that this is a lightweight version of Buffy it is a cute movie and I pretty much liked it and though The television show is definitely better and I prefer Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy I think the movie is okay and that Kristy Swanson was good and I recommend that all fans of the television show watch this movie at least once. I try to watch this movie once a year usually around Halloween.
3 ||| I love my new Zen MicroPhoto...everything is good about it except the fact that I can't listen to music while looking at my pictures at the same time, and that it says that it has 8 gigs of memory but really when you look at the information screen on the player it says that the total memory is only about 7600 MB of memory...other than that a great product...highly recommended :-)
2 ||| Henry James is a genius when it comes to writing about American women in the 1800's. Although it is esteemed one of the greatest novels, I think that it should be condensed greatly. There were some parts that were very descriptive, but dragged on and on. If you have the patience like I do, by all means read this book!The characters are amazing! Isabel Archer is a woman with a strong head on her shoulders. Ralph, her cousin, is trying so hard to get her to notice him. She also attracts the attention of three other bachelors, one who is attracted to her money. I agree with Stephen Koch, that this book is about dreams that do not come true. Exceptional read.
3 ||| I bought this cd to practice for my latin dance class and it does the trick. It is all instrumental, but like I said, it works for what I wanted it for!
2 ||| I only bought this movie to see Peter Facinelli, and it ended up being ok. Actually, it was on pace pretty well and I was interested for sure as it has a very compelling premise, but the ending was very cliche and anticlimactic. The acting was all around good, but I probably wouldn't recommend Stealing Time to anyone.
3 ||| I read this book to my 5 and 6 year old boys, and in spite of the fact that it is about two girls, they listened to every word and laughed a lot. We first read "The Shortest Kid in the World" by the same author, which they equally enjoyed. The characters in both books are the same; clever and funny stories about friendship and overcoming certain childhood insecurities. Great books for boys and girls alike - especially emerging young readers. I will read these both to my son's first grade class.
2 ||| This adapter plugs into the wall and turns out 12volts just like your in-car plugs. It is effective and looks reliable (I haven't had it long enough to rate lifetime). It does get pretty hot, so you need to be careful not to let the cords sit on top of the adapter while in use
3 ||| Though nothing I've read so far compares to Portrait of a Lady, this novel is up there (with Roderick Hudson, The Bostonians, and What Maisie Knew) with his best work.Yes, it's a page turner with the standard James conventions - the European setting, the culture clashes and faux pas, the decaying nobility with their dark secrets, and wry humor.Very entertaining, and great for a summer read. I heard that Masterpiece Theatre is working on an adaptation.
2 ||| OK reference book. For pro pilots it's a good review but probably nothing you didn't know at one time. It's not a big book either, you could read it in an hour or two. And their is too much basic 2nd/3rd grade math: How to add, subtract, multiply, etc. that was unnecessary. But if you forgot how to figure a descent rate, VDP, TAS or ground speed, than it's a good review.
2 ||| Slow developing plot requires you suspend all belief in physics, genetics, technological capabilities, .... Not at all what I expected based on the promos and hype, and not worth the money IMHO.
3 ||| I believe this was a great book overall. However I do think that the vocabulary in this book was a little over my head. I believe this book was wriiten for a younger audience, and with the words that Carrol chose to use it would be hard to understand. Once you pass over the vocab you will enjoy the book.

1 ||| Congo was the first Michael Crichton novel I read, and I just could never get into it. So since it was Crichton's first that I had read, I read it again. No good. The book is way too informational. Crichton should have focused more on the gorillas and the jungle. None of the characters were interesting, so I really didn't feel anything when they died. Too bad after all the good Crichton's this really could have been something.
1 ||| If you don't care about the fact that there is nothing new on this album then it's ok. OK.There is nothing new on this album at all. He says nothing new at all. There's nothing new to the music.Yes, I got it when I was 15, but come on Trent, grow up. He's going to be 40 this month and he's still writing high school poetry lyrics.We all feel really sorry for you trent.
3 ||| This arrived quickly and I was surprised at the size. Its really smaller than the picture, but it is funny it has several different phrases that it says when you press it. Its loud and clear, very funny. It came with batteries in it and its ready to go.
2 ||| I heard in a televised speech by a famous dim-bulb that a now-deceased, third-rate tin-pot dictator tried to buy this product from Amazon Africa, but later I heard from a friend who actually visited Amazon Africa on advice of his wife that the dictator didn't in fact attempt to buy this product. It turns out that my friend was right and that had the dim-bulb listened to him in the first place he could have avoided a great deal of trouble. In spite of this, apparently the dim-bulb and his posse, perhaps motivated by embarrassment, spent a great deal of time and energy spreading nasty falsehoods about my friend and his wife. So devoted were they to their childish rumor-mongering campaign that eventually my friend's wife lost her job. What sort of adults would engage in such shameful behavior? It's hard to believe.
0 ||| The dialogue in this novel is as stilted and ridiculous as its characters. Here's the premise: a grown man with a successful career in education meets the mother of one of his students and, after a few seconds, he's madly and deeply in love, the dilemma on which the rest of the plot depends. I was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it doesn't happen. This book is not worth anyone's time. It's author obviously thought writing a good book wasn't worth her time and it's definitely not worth yours.
3 ||| An amusing, understated movie. Matt Damon is completely believable as a self-deluded schlub. He really is an actor, I didn't know that before.
4 ||| Very good stuff ... its amazing that the guitar player is only 18 and doing stuff at this quality not to mention that he's also in Wintersun....Imperanon has there own sound that sets them apart but still stays close to the usual finnish melodic death metal sound....very good CD
0 ||| This guy may be well meaning, but if he thinks that the only reason to become Christian is to be spared Hell, then he is very spiritually immature. If he has so little faith that he thinks that scaring people is a motive that God would approve, then he has no true faith.I forgot Bill. Who is the father of all lies?
3 ||| Great book so far. My only request is if they can make an app to go with the book. I think that would be a nice addition.
0 ||| This guy has has had nothing new to say in at least ten years. If this is what you want, then more power to you. I'll take the spatula. But it hasn't been fresh since 1993. Publishers should be ashamed of continuing to promote this loser.
2 ||| This is good story and a very easy read. I probably should have read it in Spanish because the simple sentence structures and language were a little boring at times. But, it was a romantic and enjoyable story that made me crave whipped chocolate for days!
2 ||| If you want the original silent film, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It was pretty much turned into a talkie and completely ruined the original. It isn't as funny or as wonderful as the silent film. As another reviewer pointed out, it ruins the fact that the visual acting is the story and the subtitles just fill people in if they aren't sure what is going on.
3 ||| This picture of the world of British Glam Rock displays one of the best movie soundtracks around. From the outfits to the strange story-line that you figure out in the end, the movie takes you on a whirlwind of thoughts, dreams, ideals, and even truths about Glam; the music that was made and the people that made it. Toni Collette to Ewan McGregor--Christian Bale to the lovely Johnathan Rhys Meyers, you see them acting at their best before Muriel, Obi Wan, American Psyco, and the Governess. I was impressed by the costuming and the extremity that the director went to to describe the occurances, rumors, and misfortunes of the Glam Rock era. Rent it, buy it, and purchase the CD too. If you enjoyed Boogie Nights, you will enjoy this. It gives deep insight to what that period in music history really was and how it affected its audience.
2 ||| Nothing too original here, but I do kinda like the music, since I like the genre. BUT, its just chicks doing early Alice in Chains like their albums Facelift and Dirt. If you like those and you like hot Swedish chicks, then get it.
0 ||| Pro The animated artwork is good. The story was good.Con: Bad acting actors go through they are reading scripts no emotion, looks like make with video camera, alot to pay for 50 min movie nothing interesting on second disk unless you are in the film or a family member of someone who is. This film deserves negative stars.
4 ||| At 16-years-old writing a book like this is AMAZING! This is the best book I have ever read in my life in fact the only book I have ever read. This book is about two-gangs that do not like each other.The gangs are the Socs(the rich kids) and the greaser( the poor and bad kids). The Socs like to beat up the greasers because they think they look weird and have funny hair. Well some of the character in the story are pony boy, soda pop, Derry, dally, Steve, two-bit, cherry, randy, sandy, bob, jonnie, Tim shepherd, and bob. All of these character have a very important role in this story.The major charter and narrator of this story is pony boy. He goes through a lot in this book. I strongly recommend this book to everyone, especially teenagers.(...)
2 ||| There are a lot of books about home inspectors and the inspection process that I have read and are much better than this book. ASHI has books that tell a lot more details and cover all the topics left out by this book. I am an ASHI certified home inspector so I am experienced in this field and know when I'm reading a good book on the subject. This book does not tell the whole story needed for a professional inspector and appears to be written for a beginner who only wants a basic understanding on home inspections and inspectors.I've been an ASHI home inspector for many years and wouldn't recommend this book to any of inspectors in my state. Shop around and you'll find much better reading to be informed.
1 ||| I'm not sure as to what I didn't understand about the product description, but the pot (and matching tray) I purchased are made out of plastic. They look okay I suppose, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the product. I thought it was going to be made out of clay. They need to put in the description that it's made out of plastic. I don't know why it says "clay" in the description, very misleading.
0 ||| The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it.
2 ||| Tom Clancy is just going through the motions on this one. Until he comes up with a book that can equal his early stuff I'm going to read writer's who aren't going through the motions, like Steven Edwar Rustad, whose THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY was as spellbinding and powerful as THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. Remember THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, Mr. Clancy ? It was great!
1 ||| i have listened to the entire CD and out of 22 songs the best one is Intergalactic. Many of you may disagree but this is my view
4 ||| As a former major seminarian myself, there is no doubt that Mr. Kelley has experienced the vagaries of life in stir at a Catholic institution that prepares men for the pristhood. GEMINI has refreshed my recollection of the numerous hysterical events that occur when you bring together confused young men for a singular purpose who are unsure whether or not they have chosen well. Sex and priestly vocation always make for a humerous yet psychologically fascinating topic especially when you write from a hands on experience. I have read the book twice. I enjoyed it more the second time. If you have even spent one week in study for the priesthood, do not miss GEMINI. (So there is no confusion, this review was written by Margaret's alleged boss.)
1 ||| I listended to a snipet of this cd on Amazon, 'A Quiet Place'.Sometimes those samples don't give you the complete picture.In other words you need more than two seconds to judge a song.I did'nt care for this cd as a whole. It sounds dated, thoughI am a big fan of Take 6. I especially like their sessions withStevie Wonder, but this cd comes across as just another one ofthoses Boy Bands from the 80s and 90s.
3 ||| The Art of Oil Painting (GRUMBACHER LIBRARY) is an old book. I was happy to find a good used copy for below $1.I expect good service. i received good service.THANX!!
0 ||| I put these in my ears and adjusted them many times. I walked into the indoor gun range and it felt like I wore nothing. They did not block any sound. I jammed them in as far as possible and nothing. I had a lady friend try them and they didn't work for her. It seems like they need to be a perfect fit, like a shoe. I'm sure these work for some, but not for me. If you buy them, just make sure you know they will fit.
0 ||| following the guide that came with your car seat eliminates the need for this device. Basically I put my knee in the center of the car seat and put about half my weight into the car seat, tighten the belt and poof I am done...this widget does basically that, but consumer reports and other similar organizations/agencies concur it is a waste of money.
4 ||| This story is about a young girl who's mother is a writer. The girl watches her mother work and picks up pointers on things that writers do. The girl then starts some writing of her own. As a teacher, I have found that, this book inspires my students to become writers and it is wonderful to use with "writer's workshop."
1 ||| Given all the five star reviews on here, I must be missing something but I just wasn't impressed with this cookbook. It's certainly well organized, the recipes seem authentic and the extensive cultural/historical notes may be of interest to some readers. I was very turned off, however, by the lack of pictures and the extensive use of uncommon or hard-to-find ingredients.I know my area isn't known for it's multiculturalism and maybe these things are easier to find in more metropolitan areas, but it was a real turn-off to not be able to make a bunch of these recipes without special-order items. The lack of pictures seemed particularly odd, given that most of these aren't recipes the average cook is likely to be familiar with; one would think that pictures would be especially helpful and appropriate in such a case.
3 ||| After doing research on what type of watch I was looking for, I found the perfect active watch in this Chase Durer...I would recommend online service for purchase to anyone...
3 ||| I got this to wear under my Death Skull Bone Airsoft Full Face Protection Safety Mask. makes wearing a mask more comfortable than being on bare skin.
4 ||| Bought it as a gift for someone ,they appreciated it. They haven't got the chance to read it yet. What can I say.
2 ||| Another of Rosemary Sutcliff's Roman series is book, this again stepsfurther forward in time, to after the Roman withdrawl of Britain.One particular Roman decides to stay behind, and it costs him dearly.Attacked, his family are killed or taken as slaves. This leaves himbitter and angry, especially as his sister joins his captors.
1 ||| This film could have and should have been much better. It starts off like gangbusters! Two sisters arrive in a town that appears to be completely deserted. From there, the film takes a rocket-paced nosedive into sheer and utter boredom. NOTHING HAPPENS, at least nothing worth reporting. The talents of Ben Affleck and Peter O'Toole are wasted, and would have benefited more from a script that actually gave their characters something to do. There is, however, a monster that's worth your attention. If you must watch, fast-forward to the end to catch a quick glimpse of it. Besides that, you'll actually be a lot better off reading the book this mess was based upon.
2 ||| While I would have to say the information contained in this book is good, I would seriously consider the source. Nancy Mehl, in reading through her resume, is certainly a good author. However, I see no credentials which would make her certifiably knowledgeable in the field of nutrition, or the field of senior health matters.There are some good things in here which are certainly worth reading. But I would beware of taking suggestions from a non-clinical individual, and would recommend requesting information on this subject from a certified health and medical professional before taking too much of the contents to heart.
1 ||| The book was alright to a point - the end of the install. After that, you're on your own.The book basically tells you how to get Linux installed. If you are looking for a good reference on how to use Linux, get a different book.Also, when I tried to recompile the kernel, I was lost. The book was not helpful there.Too much time is spent explaining how to get your PC's info (IRQ settings, etc.) from Windows/DOS. What if we're not using Windows??? What if you have a new PC???
1 ||| This product was great the month 2 & 3. 1st month he wasn't heavy enough & it would go too fast even on the slowest setting. By month 4 when I couldn't on it, it stopped working. Motor complete died out. The company wants me to take out all the screws, sent it to them & then they'll send me a new one. I would like to know what I'm suppose to do in the meantime. Therefore I have decided not to send it yet & push it by hand. My son loves it way to much to be without it for 2-3 weeks. I would suggest buying something cheaper & more reliable. This swing is giving Eddie Bauer a bad name.
0 ||| The item broke the very first time I used it. The wood cracked and the whole thing seemed cheaply built.
0 ||| Give me a break man Smooth is fine but his new one Maria Maria oh please If I hear that song 1 more I am gonna PUKE I mean come on I know of music far better and yes that Includes 80's music etcetc the fact Mr Satana sweeped the Grammys give me a break thats' like giving Shania Twain awards and trust me she ain't got no right to em other then those Candian Awards I mean totally unfair Pop sinks to another low first It's woman that think there music wont' sell unless they show there belly button GIVE ME A BREAK THAT IS DOWN RIGHT NASTY no one should have to see that In public anyhow so to end I say this sorry Mr Santana u gotta go I mean I know of Artists that made good music back then and Its' still good today,example Harry Chapin still one I like...
3 ||| A book I have to say, I could not put down. Starts off a little slow but as the story unfolds grabs you. You feel like you are living in Holt, Colorado and surrounded by the people in the book. I fell in love with the McPherons, Victoria and Guthrie. I absolutely loved this book, I can't wait to read what happens next.
4 ||| now that she is a bit older, i would have preferred she look at shoes with a little more support and cushioning especially around the ankle areabut nooooooo, she insisted on Chucks again after not wearing them for 15 yearsaaaand, she loves them :)
4 ||| My daughter and I read this every night...and we have been doing so since she was a few months old. Start your own bedtime ritual with this classic. Goodnight stars, goodnight moon...and goodnight baby.
4 ||| PERFECT SELLER & ITEM i like this flash memory so much & the seller is very very GOOD.. it reached me in a good time..thanks seller :)
3 ||| The construction is solid, and the device has no serious shortcomings aside from it's 50w power output which limits it's usefulness for 15" powerbook users. I use this as my travel adapter and because of it's lower power output than the standard 65w adapter the computer does not charge if I am using it heaviliy.
0 ||| I'm certainly glad I saw this movie BEFORE I took my grandchildren to see it. From the advertising on TV, it was perfect for small children - the animated mouse, etc. BUT, it is absolutely dreadful. It is a dark movie full of dreadful rats. You can't get past the rats to enjoy the mouse. I would NEVER take a child under 10 to see this movie. My grandchildren would have had nightmares and I can see why it is important to check out animated movies BEFORE I take my kiddos to see them. SAVE YOUR MONEY for a trip to your local zoo!
4 ||| Just as funny as I remember from watching it as a kid. When Basil picked up Manuel and carried him into the kitchen, I just about lost it, as did my 15 year old son. Great TV (and I mean some of the greatest ever!), and excellent quality FAMILY entertainment. I'm SO glad I purchased this!
0 ||| I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on "In Concert" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the "In Concert" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere.
4 ||| Ich wei√ü nie, was man in einem Rezensieren f√ºr ein CD sagen soll. Mir gefiel "Reise, Reise" sehr viel. Die Lieder sind ein bisschen dunkel, aber das ist Teil des Spa√ües. Meine Deutsch ist nicht gut, und dieses CD hat mich geholfen.
2 ||| I like this War of the Worlds. It was a good telling of the story written some hundreds years ago. It's well-put together and is entertaining most of the time, but some of the affects are strange and just bad. If you like the SciFi Channel you'll like this.
0 ||| Disclaimer - I have not read these books. However, according to Microsoft's web page, the exams listed in the "Buying Info" section for this guide are the old NT4 exams, not the current MCSE Windows 2000 exams which are all in the 70-2XX range. I recommend not getting this book if you are looking for the exams you can take now, since the old ones are probably discontinued. The price is too low to be a real set of guides for the current exams.
3 ||| The concept of the movie alone is worth watching the movie. How do lives change when you just miss those sliding doors of the subway?In this movie both options are followed in the life of an excellent Gwyneth Paltrow. The first one she stays with her cheating boyfriend, in the other she doesn't.This goes on for most of the movie. In the end there are some interesting twists.The concept and acting are great, but maybe it could have been a little better worked out. It also looks more like a tv-movie instead of a feature movie, which can be seen in the lighting.
3 ||| Gets you started with a lots of short examples. After reading this you'll probably want Advanced RenderMan, but this is a far easier introduction to the RenderMan world.
1 ||| I started this book with a great deal of anticipation. I expected to find new and challenging ideas. Instead I found only one central theme repeated in every chapter. There are definitely some though-provoking pieces, but on the whole this work feels a bit stale. The work does not feel well researched and did not challenge me. I had to force myself to read the last three chapters.
0 ||| I didn't find that these are worth the extra money that you pay. After wearing these for 2 days, my daughter developed a pretty nasty diaper rash. After about a week and a half of not clearing up, I decided to put her back in some Huggies. Her rash cleared up within 2 more days. That is not why I am giving them such low marks though. EVERY morning, my daughter would be drenched from the Cruisers leaking! We didn't and still don't have that problem with the Huggies. I will save myself grief and money and stick with the good old Huggies.
2 ||| you'll probably never listen to this album again. All the songs are your typical rock cliches that anyone can write. Of course, predictablity in songwriting makes the listener amused at first, feeling the songs are real nice. The real truth is uncovered after a couple of listens though. Songs like 'Bent', 'B&W people', 'If you're gone' sound marvellous for sometime, then you just cant help really getting bored of them. I gave the 3 stars to the song Mad season though, which is one of the two cuts that are worth buying this album for (w/ Rest Stop). I think you'd better avoid this if you're not a fan.
1 ||| I totally love this little chopper. Two have broken on me now, though. The plastic that flips it into place jammed both times. I won't be a sucker for a third time.
2 ||| As I found out when I had first bought the DVD which had plain color back drop intros instead of the a.k.a. printing on the photos datas it's too bland with that very essence being stripped bare and doesn't make the follow-ups appear to be just as appealing.so until I find out it's released the very way it was 1st seen on CBS-TV on May 24,1995 I just won't want it.What's also edited out of this feature from when it was first on tv is the audio intro by the "Mother" of "This is our first reunion since the girls 'got married.' " of which of course goes without saying that it's sarcastic and serious at once.Also in the true Brady Tradition of of cynicism and sarcasm but a new touch of seriousness added to it.
1 ||| I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the "stretch" waist band they are tight. So much for an "extra" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy.
3 ||| I've used these monitors for about a year now and have been delighted at their performance. I don't believe you can get better quality than the price I paid. I've got them in use as my near-field reference monitors and also setup for my computer speakers. The frequency range is level throughout the spectrum, making them very accurate for home mixing purposes. Since these are self powered, there is very little white noise if any when no signal is coming through. Highly recommend spending the little extra over the $100 models out there- the difference is drastic enough to spend a tad more.
2 ||| Have found other books that cover the information about broodmares and early foal care in a much more effective and organized manner. Found the information too oriented toward opinion and not based enough on documentable fact.
4 ||| I got this book on a recommendation for my husband for Christmas. He eats, sleeps, and drinks comics and LOVES the book. So, that's all that matters to me!
3 ||| Like I said this is that real Soul Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as it is similar in a way as they all are very good friends as seen in chapelles block party. and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!!

4 ||| My 11 year old son, who seldom enjoys any book, loves to read this book. He brings it to my husband and I to share the interesting stories.
3 ||| I think I bought this album for about a buck and a half and for a very long time I never listened to it. I remember the day I realized that it was truly great. I must have had it in a shuffle and I was listening to the song 'Incestuous' while a very traumatic family crisis was going on. The pain that was heard in the vocalists voice just connected with me. I began to listen to the album quite a bit and it became a regular in my rotation. Well that was about twelve or so years ago, but every so often I like to break it out and it still makes me smile to listen. . .
3 ||| it's avery nice comprehensive set, probally the best out here, but they can be hard to use for studying.
1 ||| This book was not helpful to me at all. Matson and Coupland left out many of the major archaeology sites in the Pacific Northwest. They wrote in a very technical style so if you had little to no background information it was very hard to understand. They also tended to write background information about things that were insignifigant to the site(s)being discussed. The reading didn't seem to flow well. Over all I think the book should have mainly be used for information on archaeology sites in the South region of Vancouver B.C.
3 ||| Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good.
0 ||| This flick is among the very worst of Gamera movies. Very simply, Gamera has to save two boys from the clutches of aliens who control Guiron, the monster known for nothing else than having a cheap kitchen knife for a head. DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS FLICK...instead, check out one of the three 1990's Gamera movies. In all honesty.
0 ||| Batman Begins [HD DVD]Ratatouille [Blu-ray]i got this title on hd dvd becuase of the bonus featuresthey were horriblenot only did they not work but they were out of synci had 3 copies and they all did the same thingthe picture in picture was an absolute train wrecknot only did the movie track drown out the pic in pic trackthe little windows would close just as quickly as they appearedbut there would still be a discussioni couldnt enjoyi took it back to best buy in hopes of just a defective copybut 3i gave up and got ratatouoillebut ordered it on blu rayand hopefully the problem has been correctedi have noticed problems with other wb titles too with their pic in pic features
4 ||| This was a richly textured book, with amazingly good character development. I found myself putting the book down at times, just to stop and think about what I've read, and savor the little bits of humor and wisdom. It's been a long time since I've found characters that have stuck with me long after the book has been read. It's not an action-packed, page-turning adventure at all, and would probably make a horribly boring movie. It's more of a home-cooked, slow-simmer novel in a world of fast food stories. I believe that the more you put into this book, the more you will get out of it. Put the time and effort in, and you will most likely end this book a little different of a person than who you were beforehand.
4 ||| IF YOU ARE TIRED OF REFRIED MUSIC OR JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING WITH ENERGY INSTEAD OF DEPRESSION YOU NEED THIS ALBUM
0 ||| Do NOT waste your money on this! I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin. The benzoyl peroxide in the face wash and "day cream" burn and sting when you apply. Also you can't realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face. My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out. I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all. If you expect this to stop your acne it won't, benzoyle peroxide is awful for yous skin and known to cause thin skin and premature aging. As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing! I have cystic acne and it works. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side try Aztec healing clay, does wonders. :)
3 ||| Peggy Lee recorded many fine albums over the years... and this CD gives a pretty good overview of her many talents. Hugh Shannon often told the story of when Peggy released her version of "Lover" she asked Richard Rogers how he like it. Mr Rogers replied, "It's a waltz Peggy, it's a waltz!" If you waltz right out and pickup a copy of "Black Coffee" I don't think you'll be pissed...I think you'll be pleased.
2 ||| The art in this book is adorable, there's not denying that, but it's not very helpful for anything other than putting a smile on your face. There's next to no instruction of any kind, and what's there is almost incomplete and completely unhelpful for anyone that doesn't already have a fair degree of skill already. This is great for suggestions, and will probably help with a few details that you might have been leaving out of your chibi drawings, but it's not helpful for much of anything else.
2 ||| This was a decent movie. I think Robert Englund fans will be dissapointed, but William Finlay fans ought to like it. A decent movie with some delving into the past of S&M ie Marquis De Sade
3 ||| I previously owned a plantronics and loved how easy it is. When the charger died on it, after 2+ years, I decided I need a new blue tooth. I bought a motorolla only to be disappointed. So I purchased this one to be my replacement. I like this one. My only issue is the syncing with my phone isn't always the best. Sometimes it will disconnect in less that 5 ft. But I think that might be my phone rather than this product.
4 ||| This book was wonderful. It explained everything that you needed and didn't go into to much detail on on specific detail. I now use this book as a reference. It has Appendix A-E and each appendix talks about something different, like he tells you where you where you can buy the things you want and who manufatures them. I love the glossery, whenever I was reading and I didn't know what it was it was sure to be in the glossary and in perfect detail! I recommend this book to whoever wants to learn about computers and how to solve simple problems that would cost you $$$ to go to a place and have them fix it.
3 ||| I was very satisfied with my purchase of this book and also with the delivery.
0 ||| I am very surprised by all the good reviews here for this film. I sat there waiting for something to happen, but for the entire thing it was just unfunny. I cared nothing about the characters played by Bullock and Grant. I went in hoping that it would be the caliber of writing of someone like Richard Curtis on Notting Hill or Love Actually (two terrific Hugh Grant films), but this was just a complete waste of time where you want those hours of your life back. I noticed Bullock's name as a producer. I hope this doesn't mean she fudged with the script to make it "funny" in her mind. (Anybody remember when actress Kim Basinger complained that the writer of the script for her film Marrying Man had no conception of comedy and she decided to rewrite it? The writer she was complaining about was Neil Simon.)
3 ||| Personally, I thought this movie was very well done and enjoyed it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies, specifically ones that are a little scary.
4 ||| the first time I had this CD, I left it in my car player for days. Very good work. Often the first album of an artist is the best.
0 ||| I bought this product that it would have good quality, but no. There is a lot of background noise, which probably means poor materials. Also the noise canceling is weak. I can still hear a lot of noise in the background. I should have shelled out for a more expensive one.
4 ||| version 2.0 is the best cd ever! they have great music, clean, upbeat, and you won't get sick listening to it over and over...this is the cd to listen to on the subways, it makes your trip go alot faster...and somehow takes your mind to somewhere else, especially the last half of the cd...i recommend this to anyone who's into that urban pop music...it's not too hardcore and not to mellow, great for one of those days when you just want to get out of the city or wherever you are..
4 ||| This is a great author. Just as you shouldn't fall into the trap of being influenced by people who look like the stereotype, you should also be wary of the mind-set that everyone who does not look plain and un-threatening is fake. Many Female practitioners of magic love exotic eye makeup, black velvet and beautiful jewelry. They are proud of the magical tradition and do not care what others think of their dress style or demeanor. I don't care if people think witches are scary. That's their problem, i'm not trying to win them over. The bright light bambi wiccan movement is saddening.
2 ||| What I don't like about this production is it's chintziness - I doubt any of it was filmed on location at Newport, Rhode Island. This is supposed to be film about high society but the only flavor we get of high society is the interior sets probably constructed in a film studio in Hollywood.
4 ||| My daughters brought me to hear a reading by Curtis Sittenfeld at our local bookstore. If anyone has an opportunity to hear her talk and read it is well worth the trip/ time. The book is well written although a bit disturbing at times. After reading the book I was glad my girls go to day school but they do share some of the same issues. I was pleased to have the chance to discuss the book with my girls.
2 ||| This book was on a reading list for my teenage daughter. She seemed to enjoy it.
3 ||| This is the poor man's GPS system....very comprehensive and updateable (traffic & roadwork conditions). A must-have for we who are directionally challenged!!
2 ||| amusing at times, comparing this guy to George Carlin is waayyy off base. His level of bitterness with with various movements/organizations be they political or religious, is not equal to his supposed 'insights'. Yeah, um, we get that it is silly to take the Bible literally.... George Bush isn't all that bright...gotcha... Being mad at rednecks, republicans and religion is one thing ---- bringing humor along with the vitriol is what the masters (Carlin, Bruce) we're able to do. Dave's about half way there.
1 ||| I bought this video and was very disappointed. I know Martin to be a great actor but simply, he does not cut it as a stand up. Most of his material used in "You so Crazy" is Richard Pryor material. Stuff like masturbation,drug use, differences in black and white people, acting like a kid when he gets a hot female, etc are taken from Richard Pryor Live in Concert, Live in the Sunset Strip etc...
0 ||| We received the head protection gear and it was already half falling apart. the pieces were not put together and the foam was losely fitting and falling off. The snap on part of the mask had broken pieces so it could not snap on or had already broken off. The only good aspect is Amazon's return policy. My 10 year son was very upset he could not play withthe other kids when the face mask came in.Thank you Amazon for getting his money back.
0 ||| After turning Pretty Woman from a dark story about prostitution into a romantic comedy, Gary Marshall tried the same tack with Anne Rice's nasty little novel about sexual obsession. Well, he made a movie that is neither erotic nor funny. Worse, it feels split down the middle, and needlessly overplotted in order to merge the two sides.This film comes from the vast middle period of bad Dan Ackroyd films--put it in the same batch as Dragnet. Sometimes dumb and clumsy isn't funny, it's just dumb and clumsy, like a bloated uncle left to watch the kids after Thanksgiving dinner--which begs the question, when did Ackroyd give up on being sharp-edged?
3 ||| I had heard from a number of people that this was a book that was worth my time. It was a quick read, and it was pretty enjoyable. The description on the back cover of the book says it's about Plath's descent into insanity (<-- not a direct quote). However, it wasn't much of a descent. It was more like, she wasn't insane at the end of one chapter, and at the beginning of another chapter she was suddenly insane.Regardless, it was a pretty good book. Not spectacular, but interesting enough to hold my attention.
1 ||| I have not received this yet. When I do I am certain I will like it as I purchased one magizine locally before ordering this.
0 ||| I can suspend disbelief. I can put pretension and artistic concerns aside and simply enjoy a movie for sheer entertainment value. I cannot condone or recommend this humongous pile of dung that millions of tastless morons have actually claimed to enjoy. Acting: horrible. Plot: embarrasing Effects: whoopee, the White House just exploded, big deal. If I want to see two hours of explosions I'll set off M-80's in my backyard. Oh my god look Randy Quaid is a crop duster turned state of the art multimillion dollar jet fighter pilot and just saved the world! Wow! Will Smith somehow knows how to pilot an alien spacecraft! And his stripper girlfriend still has to go to work even though the "mother ship" is floating over L.A. Give the girl a break geez! Give ME a break.
2 ||| It does the job.. Poor quality product, but you get what you pay for. It does what it is suppose to after fiddling with it. Connections have a lot to be desired, but again, the price is right. If you can afford it always go for the OEM equipment you'll be a lot happier. If cheap is what you need this will work for ya..
1 ||| I think that Cole is trying to explain something big here. The book tackles a lot of big subjects under the heading of "nothing" and tries to prove that what Cole refers to as "nothing" is really where everything in the universe comes from. And I think it really hits the mark sometimes. But 95% of the book is semantics and wordplay. And I think the book really stretches to fit some things into the "nothing is everything" theory. You'll wait at least 50 pages before you start learning real science. It must have been fun for Cole to play with the idea of nothing in riddle-like prose, but it really takes away from the science of the book. I say skip to the bibliography and read the books cited. They may be more concise.
1 ||| Playstation has lots of games to play (that's good) But many are just the same (that's bad). Many playstation games needs lots of time to play....think, think, find keys, secret hall way, the level was too hard so we spend 3 weeks to finish it... some people may like that...But If U want something exciting, fast and easy choose something from Sega's range..beleve it or not Sega makes 70% of archade games and basicaly are archade experts...over all, a choice between PlayStation and Atari2600....No doubt that ATARI2600 is much more FUN.
1 ||| I bought this book after loving another book of common expressions we hear in the US (or read in books) and wonder what their exact meaning is in their native language. I didn't enjoy reading this book of phrases because most of the French expressions were far too advanced for me. I had French in high school and German in college but I pick things up quickly and thought I would be OK with this book. The book is not a good reference for flipping through because a lot of the phrases are just not something you will ever run across while reading literature or even while in France on vacation. Also, it would be impossible to memorize these long phrases and put them to use unless you are very, very advanced in French. The title, Bon Mots (good words): How to Amaze Tout Le Monde (everyone) with Everyday French is misleading. This is not everyday French.
3 ||| My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.In addition to the title scenes 5 more out of screen effects extend an impressive 50% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Another 20 reached 25% or more and many are in the 5 to 10% range.EXCESS PARALLAX in a few of the scenes make it hard to mentally assemble the 3D.Far better than Wild Ocean in every respect*** Visually stunning sea floor & creature footage in crystal clear 3D ***MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%.

4 ||| A trip back in time more entertaining than many current computer and action driven films. Nail biting conclusion. And not one of the apartments viewed through Jimmy Stewart's "rear window" had a television. Take a break from our hyper-wired and networked society and spend a couple of hours with a stunning Grace Kelley (cosmetic tweaking and enhancement-free) and an endearing Jimmy Stewart as they unravel a murder.
0 ||| Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version.
1 ||| I was not at all prepared for the pure GRAPHICNESS of this film. This film should be rated at least PG-13 if not R. I did not see a rating on it at all, and I looked. While the film was great and impactful, it was also horrific and I was NOT prepared to see it and was very upset. I did not need to see those level of graphics to get the point across, and even if I did, I REALLY could have used a "viewer discretion advised." PLEASE, PLEASE provide a warning on this. It WAS violent and awful. Showing graphic animal slaughter and unmedicated castrations was just, awful, and leaves me not upset at the people doing it, but the people who failed to warn me before I turned this on. I was just NOT prepared, and very relieved I did not allow a child to watch it.That said, it seems great, complete information, very persuasive. But the graphics... The graphic content was WAY too much.
2 ||| I bought this because I needed something not to expensive since I could not put my speakers on the wall next to the TV in the corner. The ease of installation was nice, very quick to setup. I had some problems working my 16 gauge wire in there but eventually got it. The reason I gave it three stars is because the plastic tightners to attach the speakers seem like they may break and are cheap, also they do not hold my speaker that tight, it is a 2lb. speaker. They also seem to tilt forward somewhat which is ok. The rest of the product is made of metal and pretty heavy so it has not problems staying on the carpet. I wish there was a slot for the speaker wire to fit through so the stand itself does not just lay on the wire, seems to add to the tilting problem. Overall this was a good buy for about 1/4 or even 1/7 of the price of the recommended Onkyo ones. These speakers were for the Onkyo S3300 system.
1 ||| I"VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL KING KONG. I COULD NOT WAIT TO SEE THIS REMAKE, THE TRAILER SEEMED TO SHOW THAT THIS VERSION FOLLOWED THE ORIGINAL STORY.............BUT THEN COMES THE STUPID PARTS SUCH AS THE YOUNG LADY IN THE FAY WRAY ROLL DOING TRICKS HAND STANDS, AND JUGGLING FOR A SIX STORY APESOME HOW ,THAT PART OF THE STORY JUST DOEST WASH........I LOST ALL MY INTEREST FROM THAT POINT ON..........THE BATTLE OF THE PREHISTORIC CREATURES AND SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE THE ONLY SAVING GRACE FOR AN ALMOST GREAT MOVIE.......
3 ||| My father loved this book as a child, and read it to us when we were young. I purchased this to read to my grandsons. The stories are delightful, but this particular edition has no illustrations. That is no big deal, but the text refers to a map of the Sleepy Hollow Woods - and there is no map to refer to. I will try to locate a copy with a map so they can have a visual to get a better feel of the characters' homes and adventures. Now that I think of it, it isn't the map I remember as a child, but the Sunday afternoon tradition of my dad reading this to us....precious memories. If you want memories like that, this is a wonderful book to share with a younger generation.
4 ||| This book was great! It was interesting and funny, and I really liked the way the author described the characters. They seemed like real people. I also learned a lot about burrowing owls. I never knew there was such a thing. I liked the way the kids worked to save them from the pancake house. I would recommend this book to all my friends because it was so good!
1 ||| the overused plot device of a woman in polite society trapped in her loveless sexually repressive marriage who has affairs to "free" herself. we see it again in "the awakening." if you like french lit, you'll love this. if you don't like introspective womany novels, you won't.
2 ||| This was a gift to someone. I talked to the person that got it and she said it was ok, but she would have liked to read more about one particular family
1 ||| If you are of the type who would like to look at an oracle query example, run it against a database and watch the results - do yourself a favor. Stay away from this book.But if you like reading oracle queries like a fiction novel - by all means get this book. The book talks about a parts distributor database the scripts for which Mr. DB Administrator Sanjay Mishra has decided to lock in his closet.I am fuming with anger at the uselessness of this book. This book has good content which goes down the drain because of the ZERO PRACTICAL test. I am giving it a rating 2 coz the content covers what it intents to cover - basics of SQL. Barring that fact, this book is worth only a rating of .5
0 ||| By far the worst soundtrack i've ever listened to. Even if you liked the music in the film you will be tortured by the sounds on this CD
1 ||| I am very diappointed in this phone because we've had nothing but problems with it. We've already sent it back once because it wouldn't turn on. We got the optional dual battery and it didn't fit in the base ( I think they sent the wrong battery) so we can't use that. The new phone they sent us is now cutting out on us and is also not turning on and also echoes a lot. The good things about this phone are the range and it has a lot of features but what good are features when the stupid thing won't turn on! We purchased ours from cordlessguys and they've been horrible to deal with.(We're still waiting for the correct spare battery, 6+ months.)
4 ||| very satified with both the timeliness of shipping and the quality of the product. would definately place more orders for refills with this company
2 ||| This book came to my Kindle with no problems. The reason for only three stars is the mere fact that I was expecting a complete book, not short stories. I suppose it is my fault for not evaluating my purchase in-depthly enough. However, I did enjoy reading the stories. And they suit a person well who is not wanting to get involved with a book but still wants to read a good mystery.
3 ||| The book, Guns of Navarone by Alistair MacLean, is a good book with simple descriptions, interesting characters, and an exciting plot which holds you till the end. The characters are easy to relate to. The plot is riddled with crosses and double crosses which the author gives faint clues of throughout the story. The descriptions are brief but good and you imagine yourself there in the middle of the action. All in all, Guns of Navarone is a book I recommend reading.
3 ||| They are a bit tricky to install, but any handy person should be able to do it. I use mine in the attic and used two together. Working great and no complaints.
0 ||| I purchased the item as a gift for my wife. It seemed really good and sturdy when I took it out of the box. When I assembled it(which was very easy) I found that there was no bracket for one connecting section. The item is very unstable and has fallen over and broken apart several times. I have no response from the supplier on getting a new clamp.
3 ||| I purchased the playtex cross your heart bra for my wifeThis is a bra she has been happy using for many years because of comfort support and fitShe would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a natural liftThe service from Amazon was excellent
1 ||| rating to any MacDonald book but this one is deserves it. In my opinion it's the weakest of the McGee series. I wouldn't avoid it if I were going through the series but don't look for the usual MacDonald here. It's fairly strong on character as MacDonald always is but a very weak, convoluted plot takes away from any strength of character the writer exhibits. It's like MacDonald got caught up in it and didn't know how to extricate himself! Not a particularly good read.
3 ||| If you like an off-beat movie full of irony,comedy,good music, and romantic twists(not to mention melodrama), then this is your movie. Never mind other movies with Demi Moore...this one is her best, and her best suited role ever. All the characters are kooky, even the "shrink". Just sit back and enjoy this over and over again!
2 ||| If you are a Rowan Atkinson fan and/or a rabid fan of British humor, This could be the show for you.British humor (specifically, packaged in this venue) at times, as all the pacing of a "knock, knock" joke.Most of the action is based on gore.Most of humor is based on lampooning British history = so, fun for all.Then again, it could have been really funny 25, 30 years ago, when it was made.It's very typical of 1/2 hour BritComs of the period.I was looking for more Bean and less Python.
3 ||| A great book but very slow paced. I really liked the changing of characters for each chapter. AWESOME!!!!!
2 ||| This book is a prequel to The Lord of The Rings. It starts with the creation of Middle Earth and how it came about. It talks about the fall of one of The Valor and the first wars. This book is a must read for any Lord of The Rings fan, it gives you the history and fills in some of the gaps the Lord of The Rings leaves for us. However, as I say in my title the book is touch and go. The book is well developed in some areas and in others you can notice the lack of development. I will not lie this book is poorly written, but this can be attributed to the death of Tolkien before it's completion. I found the book at times hard to follow and it was often slow reading. The ease of reading the Lord of The Rings is not present in this book. The jumps in time or place are often abrupt and jagged, almost irritating. If you are not a patient reader, I would not recommend this book.
4 ||| This is the best Christmas music I have ever heard! Very hip finger-snappin' funky swinging tunes! Perfect music for your holiday gatherings! Sound quality is very good! This album was originally released in 1961 and it remained on the top Christmas LP charts throughout most of the 60's.
4 ||| I replaced my stock Toyota speakers with these and it's a night and day difference. I wanted to keep the same size speaker also while on a budget. I was really happy to find polks in my price range.
2 ||| As history, Sgt. Pepper merits 5 stars. As pure music, I don't agree it's as important. The songs are silly ("Lovely Rita", "Sgt. Pepper") or hopelessly retro ("When I'm 64", "Mr. Kite") and only occasionally deep ("A Day in the Life"). Granted, it got people think differently about how to make albums. But the punk revolution reversed most of the so-called advancements (and brought back 50's style production). The album is not that much fun to listen to. I'd argue the White Album is a better Sgt. Pepper because its songs are so much better.
4 ||| These are great for mounting a scope on your Ruger 10/22. They keep the scope tight, and also provide a rather good sight picture for your iron sights if you want to use them. I've had other "over/under" scope rings that don't work nearly as well as these do. The iron sights are still fully functional if you choose to use them.
1 ||| This book is a NOVEL, and as such, isn't that great of one. To me, it reads as merely an elaborated story based on an internet biography of Elizabeth Bathory. It almost seems like a Hollywoodized version of a book, changing details and such to make the story flow better. And a good third of the book doesn't even deal directly with Erzebet Bathory, but of some clunky trial. Is it interesting? Yes. Is it an easy read? Yes. Do you learn more about the Lady Bathory? Some. Is it worth spending money on? NO (unless its really really cheap). It seems difficult to make a bad novel on one of the most intriguing figures in history, but nevertheless, this is a bad novel. I give this two stars. It would be one star, but the simple fact that it is about Erzebet Bathory gives it another. Ugh.
2 ||| When I rented this movie, I was afraid to watch it because my friends all said it was the scariest movie they'd seen in a while. So I watched the extra features on the ghosts first. That part was pretty cool; it was nice knowing about the ghosts before watching the movie. The effects were absolutely laudable, and the idea of using an all-glass house instead of a creepy, broken-down, piece of crap was great. But can we have a little bit of back-story, please? Why were these ghosts picked? What do they have anything to do with the dark Zodiac? What's that book thing they keep refering to? If the director and writer had put some explanation into the plot, this would have been an amazing movie.
0 ||| I BOUGHT THE ITEM ON THE 3RD OF MAY AND THE PUMP STOPPED WORKING BY THE MIDDLE OF MAY. I HAVE TO RETURN THE ITEM.
0 ||| George Will is a pompous ass who knows even less about baseball than he does about politics. In this rag, he states something to the effect that Tony LaRussa is the perfect manager....that if you were going to construct the perfect manager you would end up with none other than Tony. What a crock. Just ask any Cardinal fan, who see his inept moves every day, what they think of LaRussa. I could name at least 50 managers that are more skilled. Go back to politics and your big words. You know nothing about baseball, George.
1 ||| A good insight of cooking at the turn of the century.The recipes cover a great variety of vaious ingredients, some based in the new england area.The book refers to plates (pictures) but there are none in the kindle edition.
4 ||| This is the best book I have ever read. It was a well written book and fast paced. I couldn't put it down.
3 ||| Very soft pillow and the massage feature is a nice bonus. It is a bit bulky for traveling - much bulkier than our other "bucky" pillow and takes up a lot of room in the carry-on bag. It also works well for a lower back massage for long plane trips.
1 ||| This was a mildly entertaining book. The author seemed to spend most of her time describing various sexual acts and not enough plotting. It appears to be lazily written, with things such as naming the futuristic weapon "a weapon". I desperately tried to enjoy this book, but did not. Two stars is a bit generous.
4 ||| The product was described as 'New" and it was. It came in it's original packaging and all papers were included. It came within the time stated and works great! Thanks so much!
4 ||| I purchased this book for my 2 yr. old grandson. Now his "grandma book" is his favorite - we have to read it at least 5 or 6 times every night. It's easy to understand, even for 2 year old, and he can look at his picture and his grandma's picture (which you paste in the cutouts provided) on every page. The book is beautifully illustrated holds child's attention to the very last page. I would highly recommend it for children 18 mos. to 4 years. However, after the age of 4, I think the child would get bored very quickly.
1 ||| I have owned these headphones many a times, and up until 5 months ago I wouldn't have bought another pair out there for sport purposes. They have always provided what I needed in a sport headphone, but like I said, until 5 months ago. Recently, the last 2 pairs I've bought, have broken in similar fashion while NOT IN USE. I used each pair while running and lifting, nothing too crazy, but they broke extremely easily around the first joint coming up from the ear bud. I was just moving them about my room or on/off my head and they snapped. Nothing extreme. I was very disappointed. I had recommended them to my girlfriend and hers broke, but in the top middle portion. Honestly I think Sony has changed something in their manufacturing process to produce such poor quality. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!
2 ||| This releases' liner notes promise "rich classical melodies with African tribal rhythms and traditional Oriental and Middle Eastern tones to create a sound that is unique, otherworldly, and elegant". World Beat and ethnic lovers take note, you might be let down. While it certainly has some nice music, "otherworldly" is kind of stretching it a bit! That is why I'm only giving it three stars (the shame probably is more on Higher Octave for the stretch!). The highlights for me were Paul Schmidt's beautiful classical guitar arpeggios and triplets on "LA CATHEDRAL" and "PRELUDE". The light vocals by Jennifer Scott and Christine Duncan are well done, and the overall production is slick. The CD has some nice moments, and WILL satisfy those who like Yanni and that type of classically tinged New Age.
2 ||| The thing I liked about this book was it left you still wondering who Melody's father is. Maybe some of you already figured it out but I haven't. In my opinion that's different than what the other series have done. I did get a bad taste in my mouth from the beginning though. It reads:'Cary was happier knowing we weren't as closely blood related as we both originally thought.' ...as though now a true relationship was not forbidden...'WHAT! Whatever. So it's OK to have a romantic relationship with your 2nd, 3rd cousin. Please. This book could've done without that line. Yet I know that that's the way VC Andews books tend to run.I was a little surprised at myself. By the end of the 2nd book in a series I usually end up disgusted with the main character. So far I find her tolerable (despite her and Cary's relationship).I'm glad the book didn't reveal who her father was. It kept my interest into reading into this series quicker.
2 ||| This is a very well made chain and it is well weighted. However, it has no shine to it whatsoever!! It looks very grey like gloomy storm clouds. It doesn't even look like white gold it is so dull. Looks more like stainless steel in overall appearance/color. I sent mine back!
3 ||| The last voyage of the original cast and crew was one that will not be forgotten. The DVD enhances the experience even more. There is also a teaser trailer on this DVD that is most interesting. Don't pass this opportunity up.
2 ||| I was utterly disappointed by this book. But I, being the hopeless romantic that I am, found this book to be a bit boring and droning on and on until the very last five or so pages, when it really got good and interesting. Although, if you like just a bit of romance, then this book is for you. Don't get me wrong, it was ingeniously written (like all of Cabot's work), but I'm just saying that it gets a little boring to those romantics at heart. If you like the Avon series, there are many others that are even better than this. Personally, I recommend "Tess and the Highlander" and "Samantha and the Cowboy".
1 ||| When I rented this movie, from a friend's suggestion (he said he liked it in the seventh grade so at 26, I should like it too) I dind't really know what I was going to get. Little did I know I was going to get Charlie from the Mighty Ducks. While he's not the lovable winner from the show about ice hockey, he's still the good guy and good guys win (SPOILER ALERT).
3 ||| Would recommend to my friends. I am a Glades fan. Can't wait until Season 3 comes out on DVD. Enjoyed all episodes
4 ||| I am a counselor and test coordinator in a high school and have used this pencil sharpener for the past two years. A colleague at a neighboring school recommended it to me as the best he had ever used. Although they insist it is not true, I believe my fellow counselors secretly covet this sharpener and probably wish they weren't stuck using a noisy, energy wasting electric sharpener. My X-ACTO L has performed admirably, having sharpened hundreds of pencils and I highly recommend it.
2 ||| These gauges work but not without a little modification. It looks like they made a change in the oil pressure gauge but they did not make the corresponding change to the oil line that they pack in the kit. The adapter that goes into the engine fit fine and the oil line threaded right onto it but I had to drill out the taper inside of the oil pressure gauge to get the line to fit. The other gauges seem to work but they are a little hard to read at night. For the price it was not a big deal but if you get the same parts as I did expect to do a little modification to get the supplied parts to work together.
2 ||| I listened to this one over and over trying to figure out who the guy "really" sounds like....its not Bono or Radiohead...its Grant Lee Buffalo. The lead vocalist is fantastic...not many will dispute that, however, the songs all rely on his voice to carry them !! The rest of the band needs to step up and learn a few new chords.....each song contains 2-3 which are beaten over their instruments repeatedly. The guitar and piano melodies become too bland because there is little change in the song....no refrain, no chorus, etc....which is ok for one or two songs but to bang on the same chords for a whole album doesn't say much for the musicianship of the rest of the band. The sales on this album are big....big enough that I would advise the lads to seek out a lead guitarist that can occassionally shine over the rhythm section. If haunting melodies is your thing....check out Grant Lee Buffalo or Radiohead....they do them much better !!
1 ||| The book animal farm was written over 60 years ago and has recently been placed in the top 100 books ever, has been turned into a cartoon for the children's film of the same name. The book was famous for mocking the Russian revolution. This is no longer visible in the film And in the eyes of a child they would have no idea what it is linked with. The film does follow the book for most of it, but the director has certain parts. He has tried to improve the plot, but after reading the book, it somewhat makes the plot worse.This is a reasonable conversion, children and people who haven't read the book will find it an average cartoon but for people that have read it will find it disappointing because the main characters are missing, main parts are missing, and some parts are randomly changed.
1 ||| While Ray is one of the best movies I have ever seen, this 2 disc "limited edition" is a complete and utter rip-off. The extras in both packaging and video are cheesy at best. The regular version of RAY has everything a fan of the movie would need. Don't waste your money on this over-blown presentation. Luckily, I was able to return this version and get the lesser priced, but just as thorough, version.
4 ||| This CD touched me in many ways, on many levels. Just the variety and quality of the music on this album is enough to make anyone want to buy it and listen to it again and again, time after time. The artist is so gifted and has such an ear for beautiful melodic tones. The songs on this album will stand the test of time, and will be known around the world, for decades to come. A brilliant work of art! Simply stunning, and incredibly moving.
4 ||| Thrift books packaged their book well and it was received on time. Great people to deal with.
4 ||| This was an amazing experience!! I read Sirens of Titan and wondered to my self what the hell this guy was doing writing an anti-war book. Then I realized it was more than that when I started reading it.. A LOT MORE!!!! The story was entertaining, surreal, sad, disturbing, and trippy all at once. I recommend it...reading this was an experience in and of itself! So it goes.
4 ||| The book was delivered to me complete and in the condition that it was sold to me in. I would recommend and use this seller for future transactions.
4 ||| I've had this replace my old analog Honeywell thermostat and been working great since December 2012. Installation was a breeze, just screw the wires in the correct receptacles and you're set. I've never used the programmable features but friends tell me it can be a pain to configure. Not needed though, all I care about is the temp up/down, on/off and the hold buttons :)
0 ||| All these people who wrote good reviews are insane, or shamelessly politically biased.This book is Animal Farm, if you are a employee of Immi Truth from 1984. They are rewriting history people, and marketing a socialist ideal to our childeren.George Orwell must be rolling around in his grave.This an example of the worst kind of brain washing. VERY 1984, to try and indoctrinate the childeren into the INGSOC mentality.
1 ||| Well I have been a fanof the Tony Hawk seriespro skater 1 came out.Downhill jam isn't as greatas I thought it would be.It get's boring after the first 15 races andit seems like you're just playingthe same race every time just on a new course.This game was a BIG dissapointment
3 ||| Wishbringer is one of the Infocom books, loosely based on the Infocom games. Ignore that; it won't affect your enjoyment of the book.The story is about a scam-artist who must save a Jeckyl-and-Hyde community, with the aid of some magical, but not entirely reliable or discreet, companions. Not as good as The Ballad of Wuntvor or the Ebenezum Trilogy, but an enjoyable light read.
3 ||| Becky Brandon takes shopping to a whole new level in this book in which she shops for her unborn child. Her philosophy is that on one can ever have too many prams or too much baby equipment when preparing for the blessed event. Becky's husband Luke is excited about the baby too, but he is also very distracted with his business affairs. And speaking of affairs, Becky is quite convinced that Luke is having an affair with her obstetrician who just happens to be an old girlfriend of his. As usual, Becky's friends are very supportive of her, and her mother-in-law is insufferable. This book is light reading and has lots of laughs but it does show that despite her self-centeredness, Becky does have a maternal side.
2 ||| This book is about a guy who goes with his frend on a journy into space and try to be saved. The reason they want to be saved is because they find out they are on the enemys ship. I can't tell you any more because then I would give the book away.
3 ||| I have acquired all of The Father Koesler Mysteries because they are very interestingand add a new flavor to a mystery story incorporating a religious tone.
2 ||| This book could be good if a great professor was teaching with it. I had the misfortune of having another poor University of California, San Diego professor which made the book a priority to read. I found the book to be once again excessive in derivation and the problems required too much interpolation to make any good use of the tables provided. The tables were great however could not be used efficiently when solving problems, thus making homework sessions tedious rather than instructive.
4 ||| This movie was sooo suspensful! I kept waiting to see what would happen next and jumping out of my chair! It's a pretty good movie and Jared Leto is hot.
4 ||| all about my mother is hilarious, emotionally striking and all-around comical and a feel good film. all about my mother helps provide insight into the lives of others and the lives of people who struggle with identity and acceptance. it shows that people are people no matter what. all about my mother strongly shows the bond of love and family. highly recommended
1 ||| Ultimately, "Ghost Rider" neither succeeds as a good movie or an entertaining bad movie. The pacing is awful, and the story nonexistent. What kind of movie wastes the gonzo talents of both Nicholas Cage and Peter Fonda? This one. What kind of movie wastes the comic genius of Donal Logue? This one. A great cast is squandered in a morass of senseless story. "Ghost Rider" is badly written and badly directed. If you must watch this, rent and don't buy. And be prepared to nap in the middle.
1 ||| I bought the silver version of this case and was very disapointed. The belt clip is of such cheap construction that the case would easily fall off my belt. On the bright side, it protected my Palm from breaking, but I would have preferred it not to fall in the first place. The case also had a tendency to flip open while on my belt, causing the whole thing to pivot on its flimsy clip. I don't recommend this product.
1 ||| The bristles are too soft and splay quite easily. After a few weeks use we threw it away and purchased a different brand.
1 ||| I read almost everything written by Ray Bradbury before I ever saw this...I wish I hadn't. My imagination and Bradbury's excellent descriptive style clashed entirely with this B-film version of his story!!! I made the mistake of sitting down with my children to watch this, telling them that they were in for a treat. I didn't argue with them when they begged to be released from the torture of watching more than 45 minutes of this. I gave the film away.
4 ||| The chew seems to work fine at preventing build up on my cat's teeth. His little eyes light up every time I reach for the bag. He plays around with the chew for quite a while before he munches it up so it's not just a healthy snack, it's a toy. Be prepared for crumbs being left behind on the floor.
3 ||| The Spanish language sounds beautiful, almost as if the 5 songs from Christina's self-titled debut which appear here in the language were originally written in it. Christina shines on "Mi Reflejo". The title song is the most beautiful. You can definitely tell that Christina's voice has matured since her first album. The songs are fun, flirty, and her voice sounds amazing. Even if you aren't a Spanish speaker, you will be able to appreciate how wonderful her voice sounds on this recording, and the emotion she puts into each vocal line.
1 ||| This is the first time I ordered size 5. It was a defective pack. The sides stick to the inside of the diaper when I try to open up the diaper to put it on my child. When I forcibly pull them apart, plastic is left on the area my daughters bum will be, as well as strands of plastic left hanging that I have to be careful to pick off so my child doesn't get them. Hopefully it is just this pack. It still absorbs as Pampers usually do.
1 ||| If you like Dorothy Sayers you'll like this but get another version, this one has tons of missing words and phrases.
2 ||| For those who remember those great albums of the 1970s - About Us and Traveling Underground, when Ian Lloyd was singer for Stories, this album doesn't really reach the musical heights found there. There is a wide smattering of styles, a little of this, a little of that. Some of the ballad types are pretty nice, and there a few that are good dance tunes, but nothing really sticks in your head after its over. The last track is a redo of the first track of the Traveling Underground album of 1973, done at a more leisurely pace. I'm probably prejudiced, but this is the best track of the CD. If you are a die-hard Ian Lloyd fan, this is an OK album; if you've never heard him before, try Traveling Underground or even better, About Us, both Stories albums.
1 ||| This book is ok but youre better off taking notes from a class or another who already passed
0 ||| If there was any way I could give this product NO stars I would. I am 35 weeks pregnant and have YET to hear anything other than noise from this gadget. In fact, those women who hear the baby "moving" and such, I challenge you to put the monitor on your husband's stomach...you will hear the exact same noises. All it is is YOUR OWN regular digestive sounds you are hearing.It's clumsy, frustrating and doesn't do what it promises. I was lured by being able to "hear the baby's heartbeat" and I feel like I was taken for a ride. It's not right to play on people's emotions and then provide them with a product that doesn't work.I am very dissappointed in this product and I hope I save you the frustration I felt in this product.Bottom line: save your money for something else.
2 ||| Thirty years ago i read this little book, and even memorized some of the meditations. The only flaw is that stoicism represses feelings, which is why Marcus Aurelius was reported to have had constant migrain headaches. The rest of it is pure Zen, except where he writes to "Let no emotions of the flesh effect the supreme and sovereign portion of the soul"
4 ||| Untouchables is a work of art. The wait was deffinatly well worth it! With amazing tracks "Here To Stay", "Thoughtless", "Hating" and "Beat It Upright" just to name a few from this album was just what us Korn Kampers have been waiting for. I reccomend this to anyone who loves the sweet sounds of Korn. "Hey Jon, Are You Ready To Rock?"
2 ||| Kenso is a band out of Nippon Japan, led by a guitarist who is also an M.D. Starting with the first track 'Kojinteki Kikyu', the band takes off into a blazing instrumental, showing that they can hold their own with prog-metal stalwarts Dream Theater and Rush. The rest of the CD is mellow songs mixed with hard rocking fusion. Unfortuinately, most of the instruments are hard to tell apart on this CD, as the sound mix is mediocre at best. The songs sound like someone put a microphone in the middle of the room with no regard for what instrument was soloing at the present time. Hopefully, in the future, someone will remaster this CD so you can get the best out of it. Until then, buy only if you're a Kenso completist.
2 ||| for someone just over 40, consider the font of this Bible - just too samll to read. otherwise, this would be the absolute perfect pocket Bible. the translation is wonderful.
1 ||| This pool leaked air from both chambers on first use. Within 1/2 hour of filling pool, air in top chamber had leaked to point it did not retain the water. Pool was not usable thereafter. The bottom chamber also leaked air to extent I did not have to be open valve when deflating. Now I have to fold up & return it. Would not purchase this brand again.
2 ||| I have heard so much about this novel, and started it with great expectations. The fact that it was a award winner in such an aclaimed competition ensured that I would like it. I was disapointed. The most acurate way to describe this novel, is that of having both good points and bad. Something that confused me immensly whislt endevouring to read this book was whether it fell upon biography or fiction. The photographs and tree lead me believe that it was infact a real family, yet I was told later it was not. I was constantly wanting a climax to the novel, something that would grasp and return my interest in what had so far been a tedious and dull book. It never came. It was the story of, a life. A typical life. We know of it, we can relate to it, so why must we read it? I felt, that while this may attract some readers, it bored the hell out of me. Well written, true to life, sure, but dead dull.
2 ||| Jackie Chan displayed his fantastic prowress and ability for humor in this film as much as in his others, but some supporting characters seemed to drag the movie down with their "melodramaticism", their lack of ability to execute lines at the precise moment, and their unconvincing acting. One thing you may wish to look into is : You advertize this video at "PG-13", whereas it is found in video stores as "R". If this is a mistake that you can remedy, you may wish to do so.
1 ||| The stitching on the left front pocket was defective. I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it. I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item. This doesn't promote repeat business.
3 ||| Almost didn't get this book because of the reviews I seen saying that the maps were hard to understand. After looking at the preview pages I decided to risk it anyway and I am glad I did. It would really take an idiot to not understand what the maps are doing. They are set up so that you are looking at the trail in 3D from the trailhead, not in a North, South top down orientation. They make great sense when you are standing there with the trail live and in front of you and it does not take much of a stretch of the imagination to figure it out without being there. My one bit of advice, if you can't figure out the maps in this book, you should reconsider going into the wilderness, because you are not ready for it. And in my opinion, you don't take the book with you, you take a map. The book is just for helping you figure out were it is that you want to go.
2 ||| Dreamcatcher is a good effort by King, but its not a great book. But before I get to my issues with it I want to say that Dreamcatcher has a lot of things going for it. The characters are interesting, the plot moves at its own steady rate, and I really liked how the military was involved.However, Dreamcatcher is a unnecessarily lengthy book, and even though it develops its characters that doesn't justify the books length. In all honestly I got sick of it around the 400 page mark and literally skipped 200 pages, and I didn't really miss a single thing. (And I don't typically skip pages in books, I read Under the Dome without skipping a single page)Aside from the books length though I don't really have too many qualms with Dreamcatcher, and its not one of his worst books or anything its just not as good as his others. It started well, but it slowly went downhill.
1 ||| Admittedly I have not read the entire book, but it is probably one of the more difficult books I have read in a while. I do not like books that come with their own dictionary of terms, people, places and events. If I read a book, I want to become absorbed in its words and imagery to fully enjoy the story, I do not want to have to flip to the back every other page to learn a new vocabulary word that is part of the fictional culture I'm reading about. I have read some wonderful books that did not require the reader to learn a new culture or language, the authors were able to create an intriguing fantasy world with the language they have at hand.
2 ||| In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is a true story about the sudden murders of a family. You get a detailed account of every aspect of the murders and even get to know the killers intimately. The novel starts with the family alive and doing their day to day activities and by the end you know exactly what happened to them and what happened to the two murderers. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in knowing EVERYTHING about the tragedy. Capote really doesn't leave any detail out when telling this story. In some parts of the novel it is very slow and there are many parts that could have been left out. You really do get a sense of the characters personalities and it feels like you know them personally after finishing this book. Overall, In Cold Blood was an interesting story but definitely not a suspenseful page turner.
3 ||| The extra memory card reading feature is nice, but too slow to be very useful. It takes a full 5 seconds to read a 3.1 Megabit picture, so slide shows are a little slow. It plays DVD's just fine, and VHS tapes too. Owned it for 3 months and no problems so far. Only sticking point is the pause on VHS is a little jittery on tapes recorded on it, but halfway distorted on tapes from another (cheaper) player. DVD is crystal clear and all the functions are good. Remote is pretty intuitive, except for the DVD fast fwd, which goes to 'search' mode to the next scene if you let off too fast. It is nice to have the integrated TV functions, so you can control volume even in DVD or VHS mode.
3 ||| Next to The Universe, and Ancient Aliens, this is our favorite show. We love how Morgan Freeman's childhood is woven into the programs to explain what could be very complicated theories. Well done!
2 ||| Though the book is quite old. there are many good points in it, most of which would interest a beginner and get them to play more Mahjong. Parts of the book talk about a wide known rules and some forgotten ones.Clearly, a good book for any Mahjong player.
1 ||| Martin Lawrence's take on Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor movies (but without the refined tone and impeccable taste), this one has Lawrence as an undercover FBI agent who impersonates a fat old woman (with diarrhea) in order to nab a bad guy. Most of the humor is gross, toilet-level stuff, presented with lousy timing, but this essentially one-joke, dress-up movie does pack a few laughs. Lawrence does have some funny moves. Still, it's not Tootsie or or even Mrs.Doubtfire.
0 ||| So we go into "Crossroads of Twilight" expecting big and exiting things to happen do to what happened in "Winter's Heart". Well that's not the case on this the 10th installment of Robert Jordan's epic: "The Whel of Time". For some reason I think that the Wheel of Time is turning at a slower rate, and in some cases going backwards.The page count in this book is marginal compared some other gargantuan volumes in this series, and three quarters of it is a recap of what happened in the last book.I was so exited to buy this book that on it's release date I was in line at the Store where RJ himself was showcasing the book for the first time, I get home and read it, and 4 days later I'm like, That's it?Wait for the paperback, and don't hold your breath for the next book.George R.R. Martin Song if Ice and Fire is a much better story IMO.
2 ||| We bought this for our four-year-old son at the beginning of Summer '08. He loves riding it. I agree with another reviewer who said hills are tough. The traction on the front tire is very helpful and overall this bike has been great on all levels. The only drawback we've seen is that after riding for about 30 minutes our son develops a bruise on his lower back. We've adjusted the seat thinking he was too close but at that distance he can't push all the way through. He loves it so much we've been trying to find some way to cushion it.
2 ||| This filter does work when it comes to UV but that's only during the daytime. When it comes down to shooting pictures around Vegas at night though, there's all sorts of reflections and light spots in all the pictures, My guess is because it's not coated very well, so unless you take the filter off, many of the pictures wont turn out as good as they could be. The filter still provides the lens some protection though, so it stays on my lens, I just have to be cautious when shooting at night, which I wish I didn't have to do.
2 ||| Deana Carter has a half step on the crop of country music cuties -- male and female -- who have knocked Haggard, Cash, Wynette et al. into oblivion. Unlike others in the genre (insipids like Neal McCoy, Shania Twain, Bryan White, David Kersh and Mindy McReady come to mind), Carter has a unique voice and genuine musical chops.And, she seems willing to challenge the Nashville forumula. You could sense that with the title of her last CD ("Did I Shave My Legs..."), even if much of the material was bland.The CD starts off promisingly, with the rocking "You Still Shake Me," and the finales ("Train Song" and the title track) are effective. But, in between, the material is a touch on the bland side. Exceptions: the Melanie chestnut, "Brand New Key" and Carter's own "Dickson County."No matter how disappointing, you can hear that she's trying to break out of the Nash-Vegas mold. And, I bet her next CD will be golden.....
2 ||| Easy reading book. Good beach reader. Somewhat predictable, but a feel good book. I loved the ending. Another winner for Macomber.
2 ||| I don't think that anyone that did the tags for this product actually read the product description first. It is not a dog fighting tape, it is a tape to help you train your dog NOT to fight or be aggressive with other dogs. At least take a look at a product before smearing it with tags such as "appalling", "disgusting", "shameful", "sick" and "cruelty". It doesn't help your (worthy) cause when you make mistakes like this.
2 ||| This view is intriguing and if you're a rock fan of those who pushed the limits in the early days of hard rock, you'll like this film. Fine actors, but somewhat obtuse. I just took me longer than it should have to put all of the pieces together. Worth seeing if you like Christian Bale, Ewan McGregor, and the other find actors in their early years.
2 ||| I interest about the smart way to work. This book advise me that how I can working smart. After I read it. I think it easy to implement. I appreciated.
0 ||| Sent me the 1986 version, not the one pictured. It was only volume 1 also which only covered words starting with the letters A-G.
2 ||| The first 2 sections of this book were very, very good. The story-lines & characters were very interesting and intriguing. But the final 3 sections really didn't do anything for me. I guess since King went to the trouble of intertwining the stories, I expected some sort of resolution or closure at the end, which never really came.IMO, King would've been better off making individual books out of the first 2 sections. IMO, some of King's early books were masterpieces, but in recent years, it seems like his books are just thrown together haphazardly, with not enough editing or fine-tuning.
1 ||| Generally good acting, especially by Rod Steiger, and sexy shots of Margot Kidder, but an uninteresting slow unresolved story about a haunted house with copies of scenes from Poltergeist and The Exorcist.
2 ||| This movie has a very interesting and styleistic opening scene and following scenes but they dont really go anywhere, it just sort of flows on. One may not expect much change and matureing to happen at a mental insitution, but still, its a movie. The main guy is not too beleaveable execept when he fights, not at just being and suffering within himself. The best performances are by Don Cheatle, the quiet Indian/Mexican kid (he was excelent), and the big and rowdy wigger. The ending lacks visual breakthrough and could have been better, if it was a bit darker and had a different male lead.
1 ||| Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it.
1 ||| 1----4 years after the bush administartion and still no barack hussein humor only the same ol bush is bad crap..... ??same goes to 30 rock and snl......boring........2-----total office rip off just political in a bad way.
3 ||| As this movie series continues it seems as if everything gets better. With each new installment the acting, the graphics, and the script get better and come closer to the book. There were still some flaws, but over all it is better than the previous films.
0 ||| Besides the distraction of an action sequence, the movie's premise was ridiculous!How can a trial, not to mention a decorated serviceman's life and freedom, depend on whether or not a video tape is recovered or not? What ever happend to ballistics, satallites, DNA... - coming soon- Rules of Engagement II-The Video Tapes Revenge!
2 ||| I loved Jacquie's last few books (the dialogue, characters, wit, and plot development) and was surprised when this book was all sweetness and everything was 1 dimensional. Then I realized that this is a republication of a book written back in 2000? because I 'm reading reviews for this book from 2000. Whew!This was not a bad book. The hero is a real hunk and the heroine is nice. It's about 2 people who were not expecting to fall in love, but do, instantaneously. Guy pursues girl, but girl was burned by an ex-fiance and has trust issues. Sorry, but I lost interest in several parts of this book since there was no plot twist. I would say, go read her recent Historical romances which are much better.
3 ||| This is an excellent icream freezer. I live in the desert so I am concerned about the bucket drying out. Folloe the directions that tell you to put a few inches in the bucket a few hours before using and it is fine. It freezes very fast and does'nt require as much salt as the directions call for. The vanilla and chocolate recipes are great but the peach was a little lacking. White Mountain still makes the best icream freezer and is a quality buy.
3 ||| So here's what you do...A) put the seatbelt through your child's carseat as per the carseats instructionsB) attach the Mighty Tite to the seatbelt as per the Mighty Tite instructionsC) tighten seatbelt through REGULAR means (w/out Mighty Tite) as much as possibleD) pull yellow lever of Mighty Tite 2-3 timesYou use your common sense... you don't OVERtighten a seatbelt either. If yourMighty Tite is getting STUCK on the seatbelt, you've obviously wrapped the seatbeltseveral times around the Mighty Tite & that's way too much.
2 ||| Jack is a former minor league ballplayer who dabbles in breaking and entering. That is when he's not engaged in more legitimate endeavors like carpet cleaning or picking cucumbers. Nancy is a risk taking party girl with a mean streak a mile long. The Big Bounce is largely about the odd relationship between these two rather unsympathetic characters. Nancy wants to use Jack to pull off a big heist. Jack pretty much just lives from day to day. The words loyalty, ambition and commitment evidently are not part of his vocabulary.Elmore Leonard's talent for writing realistic dialogue is well represented here. As is his signature habit of populating his books with quirky characters. The plot is somewhat on the thin side and a few of the scenes appear to have been added in for padding. The Big Bounce is an easy and amusing read. But not one of Leonard's best efforts by a long shot.
4 ||| I have been using this mouse from Logitech for years and surprised my sweetheart with one last year--I hate the traditional ones. I'm about to buy two more and surprise my boys who struggle with their traditional ones. It is SO COMFORTABLE and SO NATURAL to use! I never have any problems with it and have had it for years. My hand just doesn't feel right at a computer unless it's with this mouse! GET IT, you won't regret it!
3 ||| I used this play tent for my daughters first time at the beach and we really like it. It's a good size for her (she's 2 months) but if she were older maybe it would be a little small. It's really easy to put together plus a great price, the only down side is that it cant stand up to wind. It was really windy at the beach when we went, but she held it down being inside and was okay. Overall I'd recommend it.
1 ||| More endless conversation, more nattering women.... Oh, and lots and lots of descriptions of dresses. Worst of all, no end in sight.
1 ||| I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years. They love the colors, light feeling, and comfort of these Converse shoes. They are also not "ones for leather" so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable. I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking!
2 ||| I'm a big fan of tactics games. For that and only reason I bought this game.This is a good game for short term simply because it's too short. All you can do is follow the movie story (the movie was damn long one) no alternatives. Dissapointing.
1 ||| This brush is too stiff for general dish or glass cleaning. It's probably better at scrubbing. Holds very little soapy water in it's bristles, this can be an issue if your not cleaning something already immersed in soapy water. The bristles at the end of the brush don't stick out enough to clean in front of the brush, e.g. trying to clean the bottom of a blender. Very limited usefulness for me.
1 ||| Robert clouse is certainly one fo the worst directors of all-time, I mean it only took jackie like 17 years to be in an american movie again. I have to admit that jackie himself is very enjoyable in this movie, and so is the great mako. But the direction he is under fails completely. The only scenes that I enjoyed were the nonfighting action scenes like jackie roller skating, or looking at the white girl showing some nice skin. But this is not why I picked this up, it said that it was gonna be a big brawl and it sounded like it was gonna be a tournament, but once again robert clouse can't even make a better movie than china obrien.
2 ||| The grain that was intended for this film is a distraction in this high definition, blu-ray release. The reviewer who refers to pixels blinking in the background is pretty spot on. About 1/3rd of this reveals the gorgeous color palette in HD that you would expect and the rest of the movie on the disc can be disconcerting by comparison.Just an FYI to folks who are looking to upgrade from the regular DVD, you may be disappointed. I'm a pretty big advocate of blu-ray, but not so much for this particular release.
3 ||| I got the CD within 3 days and it was it great shape, I couldn't even find it here in this city let alone at such a great deal. Thanks!
1 ||| I bought this comforter in the King size. I originally wanted it because it was on sale for $20. When it arrived I couldn't believe how thin it was (maybe quarter of an inch thick)! This will be ok if you're looking for a thin comforter for "off peak" seasons but will definitely not do for winter (unless you live in Arizona or something). Was definitely disappointed.
4 ||| These bags are easy to switch out and they come with a cap so you don't get a billow of dust in your face.
2 ||| I heard nothing but bad things about this movie by a few friends who saw it. I decided to give it a try and judge for myself. I found the movie to be a really compelling movie about mental illness. I thought the trailer and advertising campaign was totally misleading leading people to believe it was a horror movie where you would expect some alien species or some crazed bugs attacking people ala The Swarm. It was nothing like that at all. Also, I have heard when reading a critique of the play that it was a black or dark comedy. I didn't see this at all and didn't think there was anything funny about it at all. I thought it was good. I recommend it but I do think that it is not for everybody. There is a lot of disturbing material here.
0 ||| This dsl modem installed very easily. It was completely plug and play after the software installation. It worked perfectly for 2 or 3 days then stopped working. The lights on the panel indicated all was normal but I was unable to access the internet. I turned it off, turned it on, unplugged it, plugged it back in, held my breath until my face turned purple but nothing helped. I plugged my old, intermittent, unreliable dsl modem back in and regained internet access. The defective Zoom unit was returned to amazon for a refund.
1 ||| I really loved these headphones, right up until they broke 2 weeks later. I wasn't rough on them a bit, I was folding them back up after a workout, and snap they went. I would suggest the Nike SHJ045 Headband Headphones. Far better quality.
1 ||| There were little mystery and romance that DuMaurier is famous for. Failed to stir up reader's interest as the plot is weak and characters are not well developed.
2 ||| When you listen to this album, you will think of what might had been for this band. This was Guns N Roses first album, and the only one that made any sense. The songs in this one sum of the rest of their music careers-- WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE.If IT'S SO EASY, why couldn't they do better and better albums? Well, the rest was probably written on that NIGHTRAIN. Slow and boring.It certainly didn't become a PARADISE CITY around this band, as they kept claiming the critics are OUT TA'GET ME.No, they just needed better lyics than ANYTHING GOES.MR. BROWNSTONE pointed out what probably was the real truth-- too much booze and drugs to keep it going.If only they has listened more and tried to THINK ABOUT YOU, they would have written better songs. No, YOUR CRAZY was the reply. We are the best.Well, this was the best album, but that isn't saying much.If you only want one G N R album, then buy this one. Half the songs are OK, the others are so-so.That is why it barely rates three stars.
0 ||| Why Almost Perfect MP3 Player? Because it doesn't plays wma songs.i looked at every flash memory mp3 player on amazon.com. the iaudio had the best reviews.i went to the jet audio website and saw that they had a 256 mb player. this is not readily apparent on amazon.com. i went back to amazon.com; looked again and found the 256....converting cds to mp3 format is so simple.downloading to the iaudio using the jet shell software is a breeze. i audio has already set it up so you can compartmentalize your music into 4 folders and one for voice recordings.cannot emphasize enough how small it is. easy to hold and control the functions with one hand.i have never been compelled to rate an item before but i want people to know what a great product this is.
0 ||| This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Sandra Bullock plays a clueless, unintelligent woman. Harry Connick Jr. plays a hick. The dialogue is terrible. The daughter character is one of the least likeable in movie history. Skip this!
4 ||| I LOVE what Max has done on this DVD! It is a useful tool for any and everyone. It is a resource I implement personally and recommend regularly to friends, family and clients to calm the mind, open the heart and energize and heal the body. Max's instruction is clear, concise and is easy to follow and use by people of all ages and physical abilities. You will not be disappointed.
2 ||| I bought this player in April 2005. It stopped playing for no reason. Replaced battery and still no function. I emailed and phoned Sony Customer Support and they said they would either repair or send me a refurbished one.I opted to send the player in for repair. A tech called and said he would give me a discount on the repair(almost the cost of a new one) Long story short, they have had my player from July to September with no call, no email what so ever.In fact, I still do not have my player as I write this. I feel like I've thrown $150. away. As for the player itself, the software for me is great, easy to use, and the player up until it stopped working after 45 days, was great aw well. I agree the head phones aren't so good so I purchased new ones. So I thought this was a great player until it stopped.
1 ||| I picked up a box of this GoodEarth Caffeine Free Original tea at a discount store lately. I drank several cups. I was really impressed by the intensity of the flavor. How could it be so sweet with no sugar? If you look at the packaging it "looks" natural and healthy, but then read the ingredients - number three is "ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR." Considering that the order of the ingredient listing indicates relative percentage of contents, a significant portion of this tea is "Artifical Flavor." Which means what? What the heck is it made of? Who knows - this stuff is getting tossed in the trash and I'll never trust GoodEarth again. By the way, this is manufactured by Tata Enterprises out of India - you might want to do some research about them.

2 ||| This movie is based very loosely on the the old poem but is still satisfactory.Some parts of the film show depictions of TECHNOLOGY that wasn't supposed to have been invented yet.The cast includes Christopher Lambert as the role of Beowulf but in my opinionnis not the best person for this role. Someday I hope there will be a movie version that follows the lines of the original story more accurately
3 ||| The directors cut is very disappointing. The original with the voice over is better - it fits the piece better as does the music - and even the supposed happy ending is better because that happy ending is tempered by ford's character saying he didn't know how long they'd have together, but then again, who does...
1 ||| .....but I'm not a kid. From an adult viewpoint, there are far better shows to watch if you enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, or space opera. This show is extremely simplistic and perhaps worth a revisit for nostalgia, but not worth spending money.A few series I recommend (either for yourself or kids) that won't insult the intelligence: Star Trek, Twilight Zone, Planet of the Apes Weekly Series, Land of the Lost, Buck Rogers, Quantum Leap, Outer Limits, Stargate.
1 ||| i recently readthe book and whilst i did enjoy the style of the authros writing i found the book very hard to get excited about.it was a slow and unrealistic begining (the main character i also found very unrealistic). and it seemed to me to finish with untied strings... there were many questions raised and seemingly none answered.i didnt like the book at all but it is up to everyone to have their own opinion of what they think.
2 ||| I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also.
0 ||| This was the worst MZB book I have ever attempted to read. Attempt is the key word, since it was so boring I never finished. I didn't care about the characters or understand what motivated them. Perhaps I'll try it again one day, since I absolutely loved The Mists of Avalon, The Firebrand, and the Darkover novels.
2 ||| haryy potter 3 the book is the best in the harry potter series. but the film is cut short and lots of the interesting parts are missing. but the film is ok by their acting and all the special effects. its worth the price you know.
1 ||| I'll start this review by saying, like many other reviewers, I am a big Jodi Picoult fan. I have read about 7 of her books, and I just finished Keeping Faith. Normally, Picoult writes a captivating story that keeps me enthralled. But with this one, I was turning the pages just to get through it. I found the characters unlikeable, except for little Faith, and the story never really went anywhere. Most of the middle section of the book was unnecessary, as well as the random forays into the stories of a multitude of minor characters, including numerous religious clergy and a guardian ad litem we barely got to know. The story didn't get interesting until the last third, and the ending was a big let down. If you are a Jodi Picoult fan, I suggest skipping this one. She has far better books that will keep you wildly entertained, such as Nineteen Minutes, My Sister's Keeper, Plain Truth, and Second Glance.

2 ||| This follow up to the Spiritual Path to Creativity is a decent book.The first book I would have to say is life changing.It helped me understand my creative self, why I was blocked and how to reconcile the past and embrace my future in the creative realm.It's great for writers, artists, performers, but not limited to that. It can benefit even those who do not think of themselves as creative.This second book, The Vein of Gold, did not add anything memorable, at least for me.
2 ||| Purely family entertainment that is a fun look at two dads trying to make a go of a day care center after losing their jobs. Considering the alternatives they have a jump on the competition. Taking care of pre-school kids is by no means easy and we get to see most of the challenges. We get to see a little fun poked at a strict school along with a few in home type businesses. Eddy Murphy and the rest the cast do a good job making us laugh at the pratfalls and kids as they go through growing pains in learning the best way to keep the kids and parents happy. If you enjoyed this catch "Dr. Doolittle".CA Luster
3 ||| Very good basic map & compass course. Formal training in the military gave me a good working knowledge and the confidence to use it. This book will help instill those same principles.
2 ||| The shipment took a lot longer than I had hoped. I could have bought it cheaper at Wal-Mart and sooner and didn't realize it until I already purchased it on here.
3 ||| I highly recomend this book. It really makes you look into your soul very insightful, Spiritual. Very essence of Truth.
2 ||| BY THE REVIEWS YOU WOULD THINK IT WILL BE GLORIOUS,BUT I HONESTLY LIKE ONLY 3 SONGS....BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.
1 ||| The sound quality is so bad...especially when volume level is increased...no equalizer options so can't adjust the bass, treble etc.,No holes to hang somewhere....poor design so it just rolls out if I try to place in a table....And it looks like eyes of some alien from mars....so bright blue light, disturbing eyes at night...pluses are quick delivery and cheap cost....I am using it to hear audio books...(and for music I bought an some other product).....Best option is to put some +20$ and go for some popular + good speakers available in the market...If you want to hear good music with decent bass + treble + balance...it is not worth...
1 ||| Tried several recipes from this book...they were quite basic but turned out ok.The worst thing is the breads...the recipes are totally off...the bread are simply aweful...so very very bad that they were not edible. A complete waste of time and money...and I do mean money... the ingredients are so expensive.
4 ||| These sleep pants are really comfy, fit perfectly, and look pretty good, too! They are definately real silk, and while I could do without the pockets, I love sleeping in them.
2 ||| I loved how the bowls looked in my family room, however, this didn't really work for us. My dogs made a mess with their food and water. I think it was just too high off the ground for them. I have medium sized dogs. I gave it to a friend that has a large dog and it is working fine for their dog.
3 ||| The author cuts to the chase, confronting an annoying "feature" of Windows and handing out specific information about tweaking it for the better. This isn't one of those fluffy "Tips for Using Windows that You'd Know if You'd Just Read the Online Help" books. The difference is refreshing.On the down side, there's too much reliance on editing the registry. Unlike other fixes, registry hacks fall into the "don't try to understand it, just do it" category. But I've resisted such modifications, and I still find the book to be greatly useful. Too bad such a book was needed in the first place!
2 ||| It's a good program, however the instructions on how to enter screen names are not easy to find on the disk. They are not on-screen, and must be printed out separately.
2 ||| I liked it, but I can see how some may find it boring. The beginning dragged on WAY too long. And the effects were SO LOUD. Maybe that was a movie theater problem, but I had to cover my ears during all of the action scenes.Katie Holmes served no purpose, and Cristian Bale was a really good Bruce/Batman. I have always liked him.I cannot 100% recommend this movie, but in a few months, it may be worth a rental from BB or Hollywood.
0 ||| The Sheridan series is pretty weak. V.A. Stuart is no Bernard Cornwell. The author knows her history well enough, but the main character isn't very interesting, nor does he really do anything interesting, despite being involved in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. On the whole, I was glad I got these from the library rather than buying them.
3 ||| I greatly enjoyed all of C.S. Forester's Hornblower novels. This particular volume adds an unfinished novel and two short stories to the Hornblower saga. As a stand alone read I wouldn't necessarily recommend it (ergo the four star review). But as additional material to fill out the Horatio Hornblower story I found this book to be equally enjoyable as the complete novels.
0 ||| I really can't believe Dre or Eminem let this garbage get released under their labels. 50 Cent I understand, he doesn't know any better. 50 was whining so much about Dre working on Game's album instead of his that he got impatient and got wack producers. "I'm Supposed to Die Tonight" is the only thing I can listen to on the whole album. Go somewhere and listen to the snippets, 30 seconds is all you need to realize how horrible this is. And that beef with Game was all an attempt to start controversy and sell albums. 50 committed lyrical suicide with this one, I hope he doesn't wake up this time.
0 ||| i ordered this toy as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old son, the description on the web site stated that it was a "pull string woody doll" that talked.I paid $ 38 for it and when this item arrived in the mail it was a cheap,plush stuffed woody with NO pull string.I now have to refund this toy and wait 4 weeks for my money back.what a rip off!!!!!!
4 ||| One of the best electronic-metal albums ever. If you like bands like Static-X or Linkin Park, you'll love Disturbed. I like 8 out of 12 songs on this album ("Voices"3/5,"The Game"4/5, "Stupify"5/5,"Down With The Sickness"5/5,"Violence Fetish"4/5,"Fear"4/5,"Conflict"3/5, & Droppin' Plates"5/5). Overall, this CD is very, very good and any metal lover will like it.
0 ||| The video came in damaged. Every couple of minutes the screen would get white with static and it would end up impossible to follow the whole sequence step by step. After several failed intents to viewing the video it started humming inside my VHS so I decided to put it away. Since shipping and reclaims takes time now I'm looking for this video with a local dealer.
4 ||| This is an excellent book. The concepts are clear and well defined. The advice here will help many gain a healthy relationship with exercise. This is a great guide to self-acceptance and emotional peace.The author describes her own odyssey with weight and body-image obsession with astonishing honesty.
2 ||| For some reason this book by Bram Stoker did not fulfill my high expectations for it. Many of my reading friends recommended the book so I was pleased to get a copy of the ebook and began reading it. Had some trouble keeping reading as I wanted to read other things and had to keep coming back to finish. It was ok but unfortunately for me it did not live up to what I had been led to expect.J. Robert Ewbank author "John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"
2 ||| Quizas ha sido el libro que m√°s r√°pido he leido y el que m√°s me ha afectado mi vida, me ha ense√±ado que debo hacer cuando las cosas cambian... todo el que necesite saber que hacer ante los cambios debe leer este libro. Lo recomiendo ampliamente
2 ||| This is a very useful tool in the Law School application process. The 2-4 page descriptions of each school give you some added insight into schools you might be interested in that you can't get anywhere else.The one thing holding this book back is that it is ancient... the most recent edition was published in 1998. The law school world has changed drastically since then--the admissions process has gotten FAR more competitive, job prospects for lawyers have gone south, and technology plays a much bigger role in the classroom experience.For the most up-to-date info on admissions stats, use the official guide over at LSAC.org. This book is still worth reading for the school descriptions, but don't trust it as your only resource for choosing schools.
2 ||| OK...my husband and I love this movie, as well as most of Tim Burton's work. We were amazed when we saw the 3-D version in the theater. I of course will buy this set when it is released in a few weeks to go with my 1993 version I already own, but what I would really like to see is a release of the movie in 3-D format with a few pairs of glasses included (spykids). I'm sure there are plenty of fanatics out there that wouldn't mind paying the extra cost for it. I know I'd pay. I guess since it's a different kind of 3-D technology it may be harder to put into DVD format, but I will keep my fingers crossed.
4 ||| Enjoyed this cd-rom. The clarity and colors were wonderful. Blake would be very proud....From the companies web site one can buy a "Blake bundle" and it's like getting a free cd-rom...Peace, AJ
1 ||| I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads, good subject matter, not well executed or explained at all. Please rewrite the book, Ms. Abraham and I will buy it again.
4 ||| Great guide for beginners-enjoyable, quick read. Down-to-earth. It could serve an experienced stage manager because of it's emphasis on inter-personal relationships backstage and their effect on the production. Other books on the subject don't deal as well with the authority issues that stage managers must contend with. This book could be a text for Intro to Theatre classes at the high school or college level. I wish I'd read it when I was starting out.
0 ||| in a long time.This has got to be a joke. Please don't wasteyour money on this CD. It's not all what somereviewers on here are saying it is. They areobviously Clay's fans trying to convince the worldthat he has a golden voice. The guy can sing, butbelieve me so can a lot of people. He released thisthing too soon and should have selected better songsto sing. Measure of a man just doesn't do it for me.Sorry Clay, this one flopped.
4 ||| The Taking of Pelham 123 is an exciting flick that allows the viewer to completely emerge oneself in an action and psychologically packed drama of the NYC subway system for pure entertainment. The movie provides a Great two hour Escape from reality. Highly recommended by this viewer.
0 ||| I've hated this book. I am an experienced programmer, with little database experience. I like my technical books to be brief and to the point. I started reading the PL/SQL guide with a few simple questions: how can I write a stored procedure, what is a calling convention, where are they stored inside the DB. Skimming the book to find answers to these did not work, and the book was way too verbose (pages of common-sense stuff tangential to PL/SQL, such as "you should write as little code as possible", "Make comments easy to enter and maintain").If you are looking to get going quickly, Urman's book is much better.
3 ||| Identical to the hardcover edition, and much less expensive! Arrived in a timely manner in the expected condition.
4 ||| The fifth edition is moor complit than the pravious editions. I have thougt this book and the preavious editions for ten years and I never get tierd of it. I have translated the 5th edition to persion language. The autor has done a nice job.
4 ||| I've never heard from this group,but my neigbour has visit The Dominicaanse Republiek and bring some records from the group to Belgium,she said to me Paul I've got really good stuff on cd and so she give me the records and I listen to the cd's and it was all swing fun & pleasure and a good quality sound on it,so I got to search on Amazon because I don't want no copy but as a collector I want an original cd in my collection.Now by the time was gone I recieved my first record of Los H√®rmanos Rosario and it is an amazing cd beautiful music and a great sound,there was only one minus plus the lyrics wasn't not in english so I can't read the liner notes and that's bad.But it's still a very good item for my collectionThank to the sender for the quick delivery right on time & the good quality for the product.Perhaps till the next timeThank you very muchPaul music collector from Belgium
2 ||| Although the novel never bored me, it didn't move me with great force either. Actually, the book didn't get very interesting until the last 3 chapters. It wasn't until Jefferson opened up by way of his notepaad that I started to really feel for him. Very well written. . clear, concise prose. That alone makes this a quick read worth the effort.
2 ||| I love Walter Mosley. I think he's a gifted and brilliant writer. But for those coming to him for the first time, this wouldn't be the book I'd recommend.I remember reading early publisher reviews of this book and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. This modern day fable takes two boys: a charmed perfect blonde Adonis, and his African American 'brother' whose luck runs from bad to worse. Yet together their karma creates a perfect Ying and Yang that harmonizes both their lives. It's beautifully written, with Mosley writing the kind of searing and insightful passages I'm sure many writers can only aspire to. That said,for some reason I was left cold by the end, which is ironic because everything leading up to it said I should've been completely invested. If you've never read him before, I'd suggest cracking open the first Easy Rawlings mystery, 'Devil In A Blue Dress' which in my mind redefines the mystery genre.
0 ||| hip hop is so gay, i don't see why it's so popular. Rap used to stand for something back in the ninetys, now it's all about stars and their cars. Any one listening to this is probably some twelve year old thinking he knows good music, or some faggy little skateboarder who lip sycs to the fresh lyrics of this jackass or that retard Kanye West. P.S the dancing in Hip hop videos look so gay, everyone will notice this by 2006, I gaurantee.
1 ||| This 50th Anniversay Edition is not only a beautiful product but one to be treasured. To see the Lord of the Rings, the way it was supposed to be, in a single binding, is a delight to any avid fan of the books. The attention to detail is evident and a salute to Tolkien. The addition of the pages from the book Gandalf found in Moria is a rare treat! It is a wonderful additon to any 'Ringers' collection.
3 ||| This was an interesting book. It was interesting to get an insight into a living planet's mind. It was also interesting to see how Luke and Jacen reacted. It will be intersting to see how this planet is going to play a role in upcoming events.
0 ||| Logitech has done it again. They lured me in with something shiney at a low price point and I took the bait, hook line and sinker. These are the worst quality headphones I've owned since my sony walkman replacement fuzzies way back in the early 80s. The sound is small and easily distorted and they are an engineering disaster.These headphones use a clear plastic strap to keep tension on the ears holding the speakers on your head. This is not only seriously uncomfortable but after a week of use, my headphones are completely and cleanly broken in two!Logitech, which used to be, and still is in some unenlightened circles, the industry standard, has removed all quality from their products, and these trendy headphones are a sterling example of this. I could pursue the warranty, but at under $10 I'm just going to call it a wash and lesson learned...again.
0 ||| This hour-long tape opens with five minutes of ads for the rest of the series and the appropriate websites (the producers don't expect you to settle for just one tape). Then the speaker, going on the assumption you know all about standard trading, doles out rhetoric about his personal definition of the term "day trading," and it's all downhill from there. Yes, really.After watching this tape with an extremely bored friend, I gave it to another friend who had been short-term trading and wanted to get into day trading. She told me she'd found more real information at the tutorials of online brokerage sites, which are free, quick to read, and easily accessible to anyone.Unless you simply want the visual and financial shock of finding a cheap, poorly labeled, boring, rhetorical tape lying in the middle of an oversized, beautifully covered box, don't waste your money or an hour of your time on this one.
2 ||| It's hard to rate self-help books, in my opinion. On the one hand, if someone can take a bit of advice and use it then it must be worth it. On the other hand, most of the advice is usually common sense, just repackaged info you've heard before, and/or full of fluff.This book is a real quick read. I do like the author's definition of confidence which basically is "To be true to yourself and take action where/when you feel it needs to be taken, and don't be afraid to look bad."She then goes into three areas of confidence; behavior, emotional, and spiritual. She states that spiritual confidence is perhaps the most important because you have to have a belief that things are going to work out for you in the long run. I thought this particular idea was basically fluff and can be summed up into one word, optimism.Self-help books are not miracle pills, they are like private pep talks. The first 2/3 of this book got me invigorated to go out and live life with more confidence!
2 ||| What happened here? Supernatural was amazing. This record is like the drivel they threw away when looking for perfection way back in 1999. There are a few gems here, but too few to mention. I love santana but this isn't what this disc was meant to be i dont think. Better luck next time
0 ||| ... how awful this band are and this album is, already just looking at this page has allowed that dumb piece of non-sensical tosh, aka Living On A Prayer, to filter into my mind and thoroughly depress me with its complete and utter blandness. i am ready to end it now, luckily i have an antidote, i hum "I'm In the Mood for Dancing" by the Nolans, yes i agree, complete rubbish, but even that's better than anything by bon jovi. buy this album just to burn it.. make a statement!
3 ||| After falling in love with the original Heavy Metal for its decidance of sex, drugs and rock & roll, I was a bit surprised at the muted quality of this movie. Its not as though the magazine has toned down that much. I mean there was plenty of T&A but none of the questionable morals. HM2K does out shine its predecesor for having a more complete story, but it was not exactly what I was expecting (especially since it have several opportunities of the sex). For people who want adult oriented animation, look for Heavy Metal 2000 and the original, but if you have only money for one and do not have small children at home, buy the original first.
1 ||| The iRock 300W Wireless Music Adaptor offers four frequencies, but they are too close together for good reception if there is a strong local broadcast station. Interference from the local station kills the reception. Also, it goes through batteries in about 5 - 6 hours and strong batteries are needed even when there are no interfering local stations.
1 ||| I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend these glasses. The overall form is attractive and the Riedel name carries some weight, but look closely at the base of the glass--see how pinched and tight it is down there? Riedel overlooked one thing . . . these glasses do not fit the human hand! I don't know what they were thinking. Not a satisfactory way to enjoy your dram. Before you order, check out the Glencairn whisky glass--a much better (and lower cost) design adopted by most of the distilleries in Scotland and by all the major whisky events here in the states. Thanks for listening. Cheers!
3 ||| I love it" I have arthritis in my hands and I have no problem using it. I highly recommend it!
4 ||| We asked dear old St. Nicholas to bring our daughter a bright, soft (she is incredibly soft) and cute plush toy for Christmas. Our five-month-old daughter is in love with Lotty. She loves to pull at Lotty's antennas. We also will put Lotty on our daughter's tummy and let her play that way. My only fear is ... that we will wear Lotty out with all the love she is getting, LOL!!!
4 ||| This fasinating story takes you through the exciting carrer of Colonel Ross! From when he first entered the Air Force to Vietnam to Combat Operations! I really enjoyed Colonel Ross' journey and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for adventure!
4 ||| Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is about a pig named Wilbur who was a run, but a little girl named Fern wanted to keep him. Charlotte is a spider that lives in Fern's uncle's barn with Wilbur. One day one of the other animals in the barn told Wilbur that when winter came he was going to be butchered, but Charlotte promised Wilbur that she wouldn't let them butcher him. If you want to know what happens, you will have to read the book. I enjoyed reading this book, it described the characters very well and I could see them in my mind. This story is sad, so if you don't like sad stories then I don't recommend that you read this book. If you do like sad stories, then I recommend this book to you.
0 ||| This book is horrible. I am a graduate software engineering student and took this course at a local university. The prof said that the book is horrible and used his own exaplainations and skipped the books explainations. If I was forced to use the book's explaination and examples I would be S.O.L. The only reason every discrete class uses this book is because there are no other discrete books in competition. If you are a comp sci student they should break discrete math classes apart to discrete for comp sci and discrete from math majors. They should also have comp sci teachers teaching this because math teachers don't usually have a clue how to relate discrete math to computer science.
1 ||| Why did they have to screw it up?The vinyl recording is far better. This CD issue, which adds five cuts, is so much less pleasant to listen to because of all the unnecessary and distracting "chatter." Three of the Getz-only numbers are among my favorites--"Grandfather's Waltz," "Tonight I Shall Sleep with a Smile on my Face," and "Here's That Rainy Day"--so I was particularly disappointed to find that, in order to listen to them on CD, I had to put up with all the non-music garbage.Too bad!
0 ||| Horrible customer satisfaction.I never got the movie. After calling several times and so many promises. the told me the movie never shipped. It sucked , what a waste of time. Definitely not amazons best performance. I did get my money back and i left it at that. I let it go. what can i do with a gigiant.
4 ||| This is one of the best movies ever made. It is one of the best because it is so realistic of what really happens.Not to mention Lindsay Lohan is hot=)
4 ||| Scott Brick does his usual superb job reading the classic. After several aborted attempts to read the book I broke down and bought the CD set. This book should be required reading for everyone. It makes you stop and think about *your* values and what they really are.
0 ||| I noticed all the bad reviews were about this being a digital problem. My complaint is content. On the outset it looked like a fun movie. A lot of animated films these days are done with parent and child in mind. It was just us adults watching and one of us fell asleep. The other one (me) stayed awake because ... well, I'm the one who bought it so I wanted it to be good. It sounded like a really fun story line but the story was all jumbled and it didn't tell the story in a way that was very interesting or funny. If I could have fallen asleep I would of but someone had to turn off the telly.
0 ||| I can't get it to work - this is the last time I buy a partially used electronic device off of the internet.
0 ||| I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software...
4 ||| BATMAN BEGINS, the latest in a number of films featuring the caped crusader, reimagines the character in a way that previous films have not. Christian Bale's Batman is a more nuanced individual, avoiding the caricatures of previous incarnations. Michael Caine is terrific as Alfred, young Bruce's loyal butler turned guardian/friend. Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Katie Holmes round out the cast in fine fashion.The plot flows well, the visuals and sound effects are first rate and there are few dead spots.
2 ||| This movie does not have great storyline. It actually reminded me of a movie in the 80's called "Oh god, You devil!" But the best part of the movie is the production numbers. Check "Whatever Lola wants", "Who's got the pain?" and "Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo. If you loved Bob Fosse , you'll definitely loved the chreography. Gwen Verdon is a diva to be adored in this movie." If you wanted to see the broadway revue,"Fosse" and you cannot go to NYC. See movies chreographed by Fosse like Pajama Game ("Steam Heat"), Cabaret ("Mein Herr"), All That Jazz ("Take off with us") and Sweet Charity ("Big Spender" and "Rich Man Frug") and definitely you see half of the show!!!!
2 ||| I needed this book for a Psychology course. Didn't use in very often except for assigned readings but found it very useful when I did need information. This book is organized very well as well as well written and easy to read. Each chapter starts out basic and develops from there in a clear and understandable course. Would recommend for any beginning researcher:]
2 ||| This is made out of pretty cheap pot metal and mine just snapped in half recently. Ordering a new one. Being $12 I can't really complain.
4 ||| The product, was just as advertised but did take take much longer to arrive than is usual when using the free shipping option. That was not an Amazon issue, it was the shipper (UPS). The packaging was intact, nothing cracked or broken. Haven is one of those shows that is a bit campy, different and quirky without coming off as totally ridiculous. You get a bit of new information about the characters just often enough to keep you interested in the larger story arc and to move it forward, yet each episode has a complete story within itself. I will be buying Season 3 when it comes out next fall.
3 ||| I think the book is fine,but there ought to be detailed explanations about various genetical disorders in human genes.
3 ||| This is a wonderful production of O'Neills most beautiful plays. All the stars are perfactly cast and play the parts out to their best. Worth it!
2 ||| It's short and easy, but it's just an okay read. I like books about inspirational teachers, but Pat Conroy spends a little too much time patting himself on the back while criticizing everyone else involved.
3 ||| My 2 year old son wasn't thrilled with this 30-minute video and hasn't asked to watch it repeatedly like he does with the videos he really enjoys, maybe because he has other Sesame Street Videos and some of the bits and songs are used from other videos, so he is starting to get a little bit bored. However, he did enjoy the song about the rain, and he really likes to see anything with Zoey in it. Probably because Elmo isn't in it at all he doesn't take as much of an interest in it, as Elmo is the character he appears to feel the most comfortable with and helps link him with the other characters. Also it seems that the concepts in the video are for a slightly older child. Still, an enjoyable amd worthwhile video, as are all Sesame Street videos! I do prefer the newer 50 minute Elmo's World video formats, as does my son.
1 ||| I don't know what else to say about this book, other than that it doesn't seem to have much of a concept. Guy goes to Mars, wanders around with alien races, learns that humans are screwed up, goes home. There, I just saved you a couple of hours.
2 ||| Some good information here but some of it has been outdated, particularly with the research by Kathryn Watts (safergrass.org) - that free choice hay herein recommended may be making things worse. Other information pertinent to the discussion is alluded to but you have to pay again for this as it is in other publications by the same author.
4 ||| I saw this movie once and it scared me. I don't scare easily. Excellent job by Robert Downey Jr.! Just a bit long, but for the price worth owning.Leaves you asking "Was He The Zodiac?"
3 ||| If you want a fast paced action thriller, then rent a movie. This book has depth and meaning that only the "true" classics have. If you're into thinking for yourself and seeing a wonderful story unfold in your mind then this book is for you. And by the way, this can be understood by teenagers- I was 19 when I read it. I think the awful reviews are written by people with a lack of character, or perhaps maturity.
3 ||| When this movie was made, I was just 16 but the reason it stayed in my memory is where it was partially filmed. I lived on Reelfoot Lake in northwest Tennessee. The lake was created by an earthquake in 1812 which left many cypress trees still standing in the lake and around it. Many of the outside scenes you see were taken around the lake. I remember when the movie came out, my friends and I were engrossed in finding "The Raintree". Hope you enjoy this bit of history.
0 ||| I bought this expecting it was the LOEB in mobi form, but it was a completely different translation with no Latin. If you just want a translation this one will work, but there is no Latin text.
0 ||| I GIVE 1 STAR FOR THE DVD NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT PARAMOUNT WILL BE RELEASING A 10TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTOR'S EDITION OF MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. SEE BELOW.We've got a few new DVD announcements to report this morning. First up, Paramount has revealed that they'll debut a Mission: Impossible 10th Anniversary Special Collector's Edition on 4/11. It'll be a single-disc set, but there's no word yet on the extras.
4 ||| A one stop reference to all styles and types of lace; the book is jam packed with crisp clear black and white images for artist inspiration.No patterns here - this is for the artists and the needleworker who knows what they are doing or want to do.
1 ||| A well written book by a GURU in network administration (Douglas Chick), the language used is simple to understand. I recommend this book, worth the bucks.
4 ||| This was one of the most fascinating books I have read, everyday I looked forward to it. I was most impressed with Shermer's mastery of multiple and diverse disciplines, my IQ must have gone up a few points from reading such a well written and elegant tome. Its comprehensive style reminded me of Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" because it opened my mind to things I never considered and made me think. I find it difficult to point out what I liked about the book because it has so much to offer however I was moved as Shermer touchingly explained how he has found meaning in a world without god. I too was a Christian once and have gone though the same existential and philosophical struggles. I felt an intellectual and emotion freedom as I read of his appreciation in the awe of the natural world and his coming to understand his place in it as a "homo sapiens" or "wise man". Such considerate expression gave me a new understanding of what it means to be a freethinker.
4 ||| Everyone I know who saw The Game hated the ending (as I'm sure many of you did), but it does make sense, just don't let it get to you. If you haven't seen it and you like David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) you'll love this.
3 ||| Got this because I'm a fan of Scott Glenn, always good to see him carry a movie. A movie with surprising heart and interesting situations between the characters. A big plus is that we visit Mexico and DO NOT have an evil Mexican crime lord 'Jefe'. The villain is American! Sort of a Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn, a role he handles superbly. The movie is a little long at parts (like the serenading dinner or the trips to the bus stop), but has a great conclusion that satisfies.
0 ||| Look at these pathetic 4 to 5 star reviewers, this is a truly dreadful, absolutely idiotic album with 50 doing the same thing that many other rappers have been doing for years, dissing rappers, making pop songs, doing the same old idiotic shtickand what's more 5-0 says he's gonna be rap's king of NY?, King of NY?, Please, this guy is a poser and disgrace to NY (Even though I'm not from NY) and the hip hop community and the music industry in general.Yea 5-0 sells alright, that's because people are stupid for buying this mess.50 has never been talented, not in Power of a Dollar, GRODT (Although they were some good beats) and certainly not this oneThis is absolutely one of the year's worst albums and I Hope that this rapper and his truly dreadful gimmick group (G-Unot) will be on vh1's where are they now in a few years.You 5-0 and G-Unot stans are annoying.Can't wait for Nasdaq Jones to expose the real side of 50 and his stupid group.Music Rating: Zero Stars.
0 ||| This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life, therefore making it a waste of my time to read it. I would not have bought the book unless if I wouldn't have had to write an essay on it for my History 1050 class. I do not recommend this book for casual reading, in fact, I do not recommend this book at all. However, if you are involved in History as a profession, or if you are excited by History, then this is a book for you. It provides tons of information, but to me it is all irrelevant. If you are a college student with many other things to do like myself, I will personally tell you right now to leave this book on the shelf.
0 ||| ABSOLUTELY NO SUCTION AND WILL NOT HOLD ANY LIGHT WEIGHT ITEM TO SECURE HARD TILE. DEFINITELY NOT A SATISFACTORY PRODUCT~!!!
2 ||| This is highly enjoyable and interesting for the way in which Cheever constructs this New England world. The part is only so-so, but as a vehicle for understanding the characters it pays dividends.
2 ||| I usually love anything Robson Green is in. I found this series not up to his usual efforts. The story just didn't interest me. I found it kind of dull and uninteresting. Robson Green and the cast did very well with the material they were given but I would not watch it again. Other people who have seen it have obviously like it very much. For me it was just so-so.
2 ||| Actually after shipping the product cost more than getting it at my local pet store. I had not been able to find the filters I needed untill I found them on Amazon. At the time I was glad to pay the price for them. it was cheeper than getting a new filter unit. A few days after I recieved the order I found them at the pet store for about $2.00 cheeper per filter.The filters worked great and arrived quickly.
3 ||| As a huge fan of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, I thought this would be interesting to read. And it is! The recipes are divided into sections according to events in the books, with excerpts preceding the recipes. However, one must have plenty of time and equipment to make the famous "puddings" of the era. Most of the pudding recipes call for suet as a key ingredient. That, and lack of a pudding-basin, ended my interest in attempting a Spotted Dog. However, I may attempt a few of the biscuits...as long as they don't require suet! As a companion to understanding the cuisine of Nelson's Navy, however, it's absolutely delightful.
4 ||| It was very easy to install the Tivo Wireless G Usb Network adapter. I did have some problems hooking it up to the wireless, but that was my fault. It is now working great. It is so small most do not even see it.
2 ||| there is one thing a mystery has to have to be good. a plot twist. this book doesnt have it. the person you think it is from page1 ends up doing it. how boring. i mean it has a preaty good story line and likeable characters(except for his dad, but youre supposed to hate him) but the last 20 pages ruined it for me.
2 ||| Robert Lewis Stevenson's psychological thriller was horrifyng... if you lived in late 1800's during the industrial revolution. To me it was a story 52 pages long that could have been summed up in about 20. However, despite its shortcomings, it did present me with a few mind twisters. These spiced it up a bit when the action was getting dull but over all there weren't enough. Another high point of the book were the different perspectives it gave. It was worthwhile to hear different opinions on what was going on. MARQUETTE HIGH RULES!!!
0 ||| The batteries were not the same as what they said they were, and the polarity of the batteries was reversed. Because of this I ended up damaging them while charging, which is something anyone else would end up doing with this crap. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
2 ||| I can't tell you how effective it is. I can tell you that it does not run on XP 64 or Vista.
0 ||| I bought it... I used it... It dosent work...I dont want to talk about it because Just talking about it makes me angry...and you wouldnt like me when Im angry.
4 ||| The Game does his thing yet again, establishing himself one of hip-hop's few pre-eminent MC's with Weezy, Kweli, Nas & Lupe...he carries the West Coast on his shoulders all by himself...with NO dre, even tho I can't wait for Detox. Dre's influence can be felt all over this album, and to me - that's a phenomenal thing. How could you expect an LA MC, specifically one from Compton, to not have Dre's style infused throughout his entire personality? Dre infused his style into everyone who lives and breathes west coast hip-hop, and Game takes it to the next level. Move over calvin, jayceon came to play...
1 ||| The item I received was NOT the same as the item pictured. I previously owned one of the Targus PA248U Chill Pads pictured, and it was a wonderful product - small, quiet, and effective. So I ordered another from Amazon, expecting to get the same product. However, the item I received was the "next generation" of this item, which is totally different than the item pictured but with the same model number. The item that was actually shipped to me was hour-glass shaped, black, and was EXTREMELY loud. (I could actually hear the fan running from over 50 feet away.)Kudos to Amazon for accepting the returned item and giving me a full refund, including return shipping. I'd like to see them update the pictures on this item though, so that other people don't have the same problems I did.
2 ||| I bought them for less than $20.00 which was a good price for the pjs. quality is reasonable but I have found other sleepwear on Amazon that is expensive yet well worth it and I am putting in the link for reference.Women's Pajamas in Silk, TexereSilk Pajamas with Exquisite Hand Painted Art, The Butterfly Garden
4 ||| "adychamp" wrote that this was the same transfer as the original DVD release. It's not. I actually took screenshots from the same exact scene\frame from each DVD, and compared them side by side. The new B&W transfer is noticeably better. I had a colorized version on VHS years ago that was ghastly. This new colorization is amazing. The color version comes on its own separate DVD. It doesn't stray from the look of early color movies. This colorization has the same color quality of Hitchcock's Vertigo. It looks very natural for older period color films. I imagine the Blu-ray is even better. However, I must note that even the Blu-ray is a square picture like a standard def 4:3 television. That's because that square-ish aspect ratio is the original aspect ratio. Movie theater screens have had many different, distinct shapes over the past 100 years.
1 ||| For someone with still unformed opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I found this book to be a dangerous primer - unabashedly biased and shockingly slanted. While the writing style is engaging and intersting, the message is almost propagandistic. Only the Palestinian side is addressed with any sympathy - Israeli victims of terror are ignored and it is plainly unbalanced. It appears that most of the reviewers' on Amazon are letting their political opinions interfere with their objective review of the text. Needless to say, the issue is quite heated and this book does nothing but fan the flames. If you already have strong opinions and don't want to be bothered by a book that presents facts on both sides or has even the pretense of journalistic integrity, then this book is for you.
4 ||| Take Back Your Time is the kind of book that everyone on the planet should read. We're all running around like maniacs most of the time, desperate to get an endless amount of mostly useless things accomplished. Jasper tells how to separate the wheat from the chaff and focus on what's really important. Her suggestions are sensible, intelligent, creative. My husband and I have both read the book and are now trying to apply all the helpful ideas to our lives.
3 ||| The small one was broken when I rec'd it. The larger one didn't work that great on my pocket knife but it seems reall good for my survival knife. So I would say it's pretty decent.
1 ||| The day I bought this book I couldn't wait to start reading it. But I soon realized it was just another Politically correct book from one of TV's talking heads. Almost every life story in the book was about how they made it through the war and into the Democratic party to make the world a better place, with a few token stories about some other people who happened to be republicans and thus thier stories were glossed over. My question is, What does politics have to do with these storise? A disappointing book over all.
0 ||| This book is very silly. If you want a sensible book explaining the virtues of the family bed, read William Sears.
4 ||| I've just started exploring jazz and this is definately the best album I've bought so far. With this album, John Coltrane takes you on a journey. It's as if you're watching a movie. A real masterpiece, which you can listen over and over and over...
2 ||| I needed something hot to wrap around my neck that will stay one. This one sounded good because it is a collar and has a part that goes down the back. I am instructed to use moist heat, so I use the one I have, which is rectangular, with a wet towel inside the pouch. This one came with a warning in BIG letters. DO NOT GET IT MOIST OR WET. What? Apparently, if you get it wet, the gel swells up and is no good. Plus, I am an average size 5'4" woman, and it is too big, I can hardly fasten it. It is going back to Amazon.
3 ||| Basically, in my own words, Emigrate is sort of a side project for Richard Kruspe (guitarist and founder of Rammstein). Its all in English, so for the non-german listeners it should be a lot easier to understand. In a couple of the songs, I could hear some basic beats taken from Rammstein to be implemented here. But, it really does have a whole new sound. The songs vary in pace and strength of the beats. Overall, a very good cd and well worth it. Especially if youre a fan of Kruspe.
2 ||| This book was not bad, just slow and uneventful. Jordan spends a lot of time descibing unimportant and irrelevant things. After reading the book, you almost start to wonder if he is trying to drag his story out as much as he possibly can. I almost wish I had waited until the paperback came out because nothing changes in the end, you could almost skip the book and read the next and not be lost.
4 ||| THE BEST SELF-AWARENESS JOURNEY EVER!NO ONE CAN REMIND YOU ABOUT YOURSELF MORE THAN YOU CANBUY IT , USE IT , LIVE IT!
2 ||| I remember seeing the American version of this movie and thinking that whoever designed her cloths was wonderful. Everything else just seemed like a dream with a few 'slasher' film images. I will have to revisit, it has been over 25 years and I have since read enough about the film to see it with different eyes.
2 ||| In the world of electronica, there is an overabundance of very cheesy female vocal tracks. Highly evident in the genre of trance.Not so on Chevy Martin's "Just Lounge". Instead, it is crawling with lame male vocals. Too bad as the actual music to a lot of the tracks featured on this compilation is pretty good, but I just can't listen past the brainless lyrics.The opener, "Everybody Dance" is a gem of a track. The other two track noteables include, "Beautiful Day" and "Just Another Friday". The remaining tracks are average or below average in my opinion (and mostly for the reason stated above). Another minus is the album is unmixed.I suggest a pass on purchasing this one.3/5 stars.
3 ||| Angels Eyes really works with getting rid of the staining but I have a hard time getting my Toy Poodle to eat the food with it on. He obviously doesn't care for the taste so I have to put only a little on the canned food at a time and put lunch meat pieces in the food to get him to eat it. I find that if I mix it really well in the foods gravy he will eat it. The staining has really improved since I started feeding it to my dog. Next time I purchase it I am going to try the meat flavored to see if he likes it better than the regular flavor.
2 ||| After reading through all the hip hop comparisons in the previous reviews, I was surprised that no-one had mentioned how much this sounds like PAVEMENTS first 7" offerings (or the compilation "Westing, by Musket and Sextant") If you like that era PAVEMENT, I think you will like this...this is not an essential album, but will probably be some kids favorite somewhere, and that's always a nice thing....
3 ||| ...NOW 9 is a good compilation (B+) with many good songs and others really bad...like all the NOW serie.BEST Songs: "Stuck In A Moment" (U2): Excellent!!! 100% classical U2 rock, a great tune, I remember the Joshua Tree (10/10).If you like this song then buy the last U2 album "All That You Can't Live Behind" with lots of great tunes...2nd:"Dig In" (Lenny Kravitz): A great rock song. Lenny is totally a rock star.(8/10)WORST songs:"Drowning" (Backstreet Boys): A really BAD song from a boy group. So boring! No rocks! Only filler(0/10)2nd: "Gone" (*N-Sync): Another boy band...This song is terrible but not as bad as BSB (1/10)
3 ||| I love my Silk Tank Tops. I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice. Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks. The quality is very good for the price. The initial fit was just a tad snug, but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now. I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk. But for casual wear, or sleeping at night I love them.
1 ||| I bought this book in anticipation of the film starring Will Smith. I must say it was a very short story. I continued on into the short stories afterward thinking I was still reading I am Legend, only to quickly realize they had nothing to do with it. I was very disappointed. I suppose I should have looked over some of the other customer reviews first.I would not have bought this had I known that merely half the book is I am Legend. I gave it 2 stars because at least what I read was interesting enough. I hope the movie is better and doesn't end the way the book did.
3 ||| To all who are "dissing" the new CD - instead of being shallow dilettantes and dissecting the lyrics,guest artists, music, copy protection,etc - how about just feeling the joyful sound that comes from Carlos's fingers as he graciously shares his gift and his innate joy. If everyone were as gracious, humanistic, loving and joyful as Carlos then the world would indeed be a better place. So, instead of picking the CD apart as drivel, lighten up and just listen to the music of the man who embodies his art.
3 ||| These are the funs songs your parents sang around the house, and no one knew where they'd heard them--they heard 'em from Phil Harris! Completely goofy, corny and fun.
1 ||| There is often a lure to read a book that is the basis of a new movie, and that call has led to reading some outstanding works of fiction. I usually read the book first and often end up skipping the movie. "Oil!" however was a complete disappointment. The broad strokes of the book are engaging and the first third is inviting with dynamic characters in an urgent Southern California environment. And then nothing interesting happens from there... It becomes a poorly told story of a privileged young man's growing disdain for capitalism. If you read the book after seeing the film - you will be disappointed. Kasey Cotulla
4 ||| I read this a few months ago. I was recovering from a back injury and thankfully I had this book with me. There aren't many books that pull this level of detail and numerous character introductions without overwhelming the reader. It engages you from the beginning and gets better and better as you read. I let out a long breath when I was done,and I actually felt as if I had accomplished the deed of freeing Scotland myself. Spectacular!
0 ||| A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway is a dreadfully boring novel. The characters Catherine and Frederick, are mindless nits wrapped up in their love affair, while enlisted in World War I. I thought the book lacked a single intelligent thought throughout its contents.To me a good book is one that is thought provoking and makes one think, and when coming near the end gets a feeling as if they had befriended the characters. In a Farewell to Arms, the only thing I thought about was the frivolity of the characters and how they were devoid of any verisimilitude. I only wished that the end would come quicker so I wouldn't have to read another drawn out conversation on the reassurance of their love for another. I strongly urge any reader of books on compassion and intelligence to stray from opening A Farewell to Arms.
2 ||| While thought provoking, McKibben would have served his readers better by some judicious self-editing. His ideas get lost in examples and counter examples. Transitions between chapters are weak, as though he made a book of several, seperate essays.
4 ||| It's the same battery you would get ordering directly from Irobot, but with free shipping and a lower price tag. It works exactly as advertised giving our old Roomba a new burst of energy and a longer vacuuming time.
4 ||| This is a great book, fun and full of significance. I can still see the main character riding his bike "Bice" and feel his loneliness. Very ironic the way in which the author describe everyday life: you will love it!
1 ||| Some of these cheezy "B" movies are so bad, they are funny without trying to be. MS vs GO is not one of these. There were a few moments that got a chuckle, usually from the really bad computer graphics, or poor location choices (The San Francisco International Airport is nowhere near a beach....which was supposed to be Half Moon Bay...really bad with locations here) or the bad military graphics...When Mega Shark is flanking the destroyer, tiny explosions are seen coming from the boats guns, which are not even raised shooting straight forward. I was also amazing how 99% of the Japanese actors spoke perfect American/English. Not that I was expecting realism here...Doesn't anybody look at these mistakes while editing or making the movie.This movie could have been made by an elementary school video class. Debbie Gibson did an okay job, as did her Japanese love interest, but that "Irish" guy....what a bozo!
1 ||| I like Matthew Broderick very much and the other actors here are quite good, too, but this movie is as irritating as they come. It's a "rich-kid fantasy cartoon" of a movie, firing at easy targets and reminding me of the many reasons I hated growing up in the comfortable suburbs. If your idea of compelling characters is spoiled, obnoxious brats who think the world owes them everything, help yourself.
2 ||| Book was like new, arrived in the timeframe specified. Spine had no creases and although it had a library marking, one must assume the retailer is helping them market excess copies of donated paperbacks.
0 ||| Used it once for some light frying and the bottom of the pan is ruined.Returned it as soon as possible.I agree with some other reviewer, something is fishy about all those 5 star reviews.
0 ||| I had another infrared massager before this one that I used for years to help with sore muscles and a nasty TMJ condition. It finally shorted out and I bought this product just a few weeks ago. I had one of the worst headaches of my entire life yesterday and was using this on my jaw when I most unfortunately fell asleep. I guess muscle relaxers and vicodin will do that to you. Anyway, when I woke up, I found that I had rolled over and the infrared massager was underneath my pillow. It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress. I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me. This is not a safe product - it either needs to be made of sturdier material than cheap plastic or have a timer on it - I would certainly be willing to pay the extra money to not have to worry about setting fire to my house or burning myself. Sorry - can't recommend it.
4 ||| I've read the early reviews many months back touting it as "Harry Potter for adults" and was just thrilled when the book arrived last week from Amazon.I hated Emma. Absolutely hated it. I thought it was just far too slow. This book felt like Emma in the beginning. My eyes were starting to glaze and I was quite ready to put it down and put off continuing reading it for a year. I gave it another 200 pages and was surprised. The writing "grew on me." I started noticing the humor behind the story and started enjoying the witty little subplots the writer introduced.I don't want to spoil anything but this is not a sharply contrasted environment that many fellow theoretical "magicians" have been expecting and you really have to "R-E-A-D" to appreciate all the work that has been invested by the writer. This not a modern novel in style.This is an exquisitely crafted world and the writing mimics the classics quite well; and Susanna Clarke, I await your next novel eagerly.
3 ||| Trigger works well, though can be touchy to set-up. Slathering a bit of peanut butter on the trigger plate works well. Seems to have caught a few mice in a few days. Make sure to take the little guys far far away so they don't come back. Even more important with chipmunks, etc.Overall worth the price considering it is reusable and able to safely transport the trapped animal to a new home.
4 ||| I bought this series based on reviews and the description, and I'm not disappointed. The DVDs arrived on time in perfect condition. It's a short series that consists of two discs with short episodes (and a third disc with ova episodes and extras). I thought it was funny at the beginning, how everyone has all these problems and Yukito is in the middle of it all, without really caring, and how Misuzu randomly falls. (this is funny until later, but I won't give it away), but it all follows a strong storyline, basically about a winged girl in the sky who has bad dreams, and most of the characters goals, overall, are to find her and give her good dreams. It sounds a little stupid when you say it, but it makes sense in the manga. Anyway, I liked this series, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new anime to watch. However, it's very short, so if it's a long, dramatic series you're looking for, I would not suggest this.
4 ||| Love these pants! I wear a 10/12 in a jean. Ordered a large and they a slightly baggy, just the way I like it. I am only 5' 1" and the adjustable drawstring ankle works great for me! Subdued colors, lots of pockets and sits below the waist. Nothing negative to say!
3 ||| ON FIRE is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about a man's life who also happens to be a firefighter. Brown is a regular guy who worked hard to become a writer, not because he didn't want to be a firefighter, but because he thought he could do something else to contribute to others, doing work as a writer.I think the book is very good. I do not think the book is great. I think the book is worth reading, but I also think if you want to learn more about firefighting there are probably better books out there. Still, I think the book was not a waste of time, as some other reviewers thought it was.
2 ||| These diapers are great but I do prefer swaddlers version. They are not as soft as the swaddlers but aside from that they get the job done.
0 ||| It was broke when I got it I was so mad I bought this for my grandma and it was broke when it arrived to her house.
2 ||| There were bits and pieces in the story that I liked. I enjoyed the character of Miss Dempsey, the housekeeper. She seemed the most human to me - even with her little eccentricities. But I was very disappointed with how the story went with Sister Philomena. Everything in the village - including the convent - was purposely dark, but I was hoping for growth of some sort with at least some of the characters. But the only one who seemed to grow at all was Miss Dempsey. Other characters might have moved on, but they did not necessarily grow in the process.
4 ||| i would like to thank reviewer mary whipple for pointing me in the direction of this fantastic book. it's a great old-fashion novel, full of complex and interesting characters, that paints a vivid picture of pre-world war I english society in a thoroughly entertaining story. isabel colegate's writing is dazzling to boot. upon finishing this book, i got on my computer and bought everything else that i could find by this author. if her other novels are even close to this good, that will have been money well spent.
1 ||| They were comfy for about two days, then they got the little beads that cheap t-shirts get after a few washes -- and I only washed the sheets once! I guess you get what you pay for.
1 ||| Got the slushie maker from home shopping club. Actually it does work, but you have to not pay any attention to the instructions, they don't make any sense. you just put ice half way up in the container, use the salt cup provided with the machine, pour salt on it (you can use regular salt) then more ice cubes to 3/4's of the way up, more salt on that. Turn the machine on and gradually pour in the liquid from the top dispenser. It does work. However it does not do diet sodas or fruit juices, only liquids with high sugar content. If you are on a diet, don't use this machine. otherwise it does work. Some writers say that the machine can walk across the counter top it will if you put too much ice in it, it causes the canister to get cold too quickly, and causes the paddles to stick on the ice on the canister. Too much ice is no good. I think that it is over priced, but the machine is not all that bad. I only give it two stars because the instruction book is bunk.
4 ||| I just finished reading Julia Scheeres' beautifully written memoir. Her story reinforced my belief that parents who believe they are 100% right about any ideology can destroy their children. Every couple who plans to have or adopt a child should read JESUS LAND first.Scheeres' memoir about being raised in a fundamentalist Christian home parallels the struggles of any child raised with absolute values and beliefs. When there is no space for questioning or original thought a child with a good mind is going to suffer. Scheeres had a good mind.
4 ||| Some strange reason, the book I ordered didn't delivered first time (post office returned to the sender). Without further fuss, this seller sent me second time, apologizing the trouble, like it was his own fault. The total shipping charge must be more than the price I paid for. I strongly recommend this seller for his great business practice.
3 ||| This is a great pan, easy to clean, sturdy - we have had many Faberware products and this one, as usual, stands out.
3 ||| I'll keep this short. Every song on 2.0 is good and most of them border on great or better. Its an album you can listen to from start to finish and not have to skip past filler. My only complaint is that the lyrics, after a while, are a bit unfulfilling. They are always interesting, but once in a while its like "Say something meaningfull!". Not that the songs are devoid of meaning, but its nice to hear a storyline or at least a continuation of the same thought throughout the song. This is especially apparent on "When I Grow Up". Anyhow, this is still a great album and I'm very thankfull that Garbage made it. By the way, Shirley is wonderfull and essential, but your confused if you dont think that its the whole band that makes it work. Shirley and the rest of them couldnt do what they do without each other.
3 ||| I loved the Mad Max movies,the first one is pretty good if you haven't watched it in a long time.I've never liked racing movies or high-speed pursuit movies except the Mad Max films...it's just good old-fashion action without slow-motion moments or re-hashed effects you see in modern movies.The movie has one thing I wished they changed-the legendary villian known as the Night Rider dies at the beginning of the film,yet throughout the film the biker gang he led honors his name deeply yet throughout the story you just don't get to see what made the Night Rider so legendary.Overall a good film.
4 ||| I just placed my order for this wonderul television yesterday morning. I spent a week going through all the reviews and all information I could find about this tv. Everything sounds so wonderful and at 1329.00 I can't really go wrong. I'll see in a few days. I will update once it's here.***update***02/17/04 I ordered this TV on 02/13/04. Already shipping late, according to order status it still hasn't shipped. The product page advised that it ships in 24 hrs. We'll see how much longer it takes.
0 ||| I love Enya with all my heart and was anxiously anticipating this new album. I love how her music is so moving and mood altering.However, this album absolutely stunned me. It does not possess the mood of the other albums, has nothing consequential to say, and sounds more like an album of children's songs with the simple melodies and highly predictable lyrics.There are 2 songs on this entire album that I "like" but none i love.I hope future endeavors do not duplicate this horrific collection.I guess I will have to wait another 5 years.
4 ||| Read this book over and over again! Memorize it, live it, then pass it on or buy it for someone you love! They'll thank you.
2 ||| this a great movie -what a shame they did not re-channel the mono soundtrack The transfer looks good, it was one of the best photographed movies of that period.I don't know why, but I was unable to access the menu and see the extras - tried on two players.
0 ||| The overall appearance of gluten free bread was poor. It lacked proper shape and texture.
4 ||| I have been drumming for a long time and have been called on to do all kinds of playing from polkas to avant garde. However, I wanted to be certain that I played each Latin rhythm basically correctly underneath my own stuff. "Latin Ryhthms" spells it all out. Thank you, "Latin Rhythms"!
1 ||| Hammer has a good feel and is the perfect size. I bought it to use at work but the handle broke off after using it the second time.
0 ||| This book starts with the assumption that the African American applicant is sub-par. It goes so far as to suggest that African American students make certain that the college of their choice include remedial courses to assure that they are allowed to graduate (since ivy league colleges have lowered their standards to attract minorities, but have neglected to include remedial studies). I hoped this book would provide suggestions of the best colleges that would widen the horizons of my academically talented, African American child. It gave a list of schools where an African American might actually graduate! I am appalled.
0 ||| Has there ever been a more constipated writer than Robert Jordan? Virtually zero plot movement takes place in this 672 bag of gas. If Jordan had been writing Lord of the Rings, the hobbits would still be in Rivendell in Book 10. I constantly fought the urge to skim through large sections of the book in hopes of finding some sections that wouldn't put me to sleep. What a major disappointment this series has become after such a promising start. I suspect that people keep buying it because, like me, they've invested too much time in the series not to see how it ends.
1 ||| I don't like this new song "Wifey" at all, it is well sung though, so I did add an extra point for that. At 1st it kinda sounds like their awsome song "Too Close" but these lyrics are just way weird.
3 ||| Strip out the filler and you have a damn good recording. Maybe that's what artists and companies expect us to do for ourselves in the digital age ... for our own good we are being given creative control. But I'm old fashioned and expect to buy something that's already been edited.I think a very good 10-song release would have been something like the following (in order):1. Rough Justice2. Let Me Down Slow3. Driving Too Fast4. Rain Fall Down5. Look What The Cat Dragged In6. This Place Is Empty7. Laugh I Nearly Died8. Back Of My Hand9. Infamy10. Oh No Not You AgainSorry if I left off anyone's favourite track but the other songs are forgettable (and that's being kind).
3 ||| This is a very good product. I begin use this evening creme, about a month ago and i can already see some subtle improvements on my skin.
0 ||| H. P. Lovecraft was a brilliant, gifted author...OF FICTION!Which is what this **is**!!***FICTION!***The Necronomicon *was* and *is*...FICTION!!The lumpen buffoons who can't get this into their rattling noggins, whether New Age Ninnys or Stone Age Evangelicals, belong in the nut hatch!UPDATE_____________To cure the false idea that Lovecraft believed in his ***fictional*** creations, I suggest you read Lovecraft's biography--Lovecraft: A BiographyOr the two volume biographyI Am Providence: The Life and Times of H. P. Lovecraft (2 VOLUMES)Or, read Lovecraft's very own words on his beliefs--Against Religion: The Atheist Writings of H.P. LovecraftH.P. Lovecraft was an ATHIEST. He denied the supernatural in all forms, & did not believe in magic.
4 ||| This is what I liked about amazon in the first place! I purchased a new to me truck and so I needed the repair manual as well. Instead of paying the full $19.99 + tax, I got a gently used one, (like my new truck) for pennies! This item was represented well and shipping was quick enough. Very happy with this purchase.
4 ||| I'm not one of those fans of Devin like Mike Patton fans that think even if he farts into a microphone it is pure gold!!! but Devin is my favourite artist, no doubt. I thought the comeback self titled album was a huge disappointment. Heavy, no substance. Strapping without the Devin touch. But Alien and now The New Black are something completely different. This album shows why Devin is a musical GOD.It is tracks like 'The Death Of Music' that make Devin who he is today, and this album takes his regime to a new level. Tracks like "Almost Again, The New Black, Monument, Wrong Side", I'm at a loss for words, pure musical magic. I saw in a review before that Godsmack are the best band on the planet. Listening to this album makes me feel sorry for such misguided, limited people.Buy this album, thank whoever you wish to thank that you love metal and bang your headLong Live REAL metal, it is in short supply in this age of Core new Nu-metal samey boringness.
1 ||| This movie fails in establishing a story and characters one could warmly relate to. I mean Meg's character behaves too juvenile (to put it mildly) while the other lead character has no charisma even though the screenwriter tries to make him look like an expert in communicating with a flight-shy and awkward-with-men woman.
2 ||| THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF DAVID FINCHERS BEST YET IT HAS NO BONUS MATERIAL AND THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE, ONLY BUY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OWNING A GREAT FILM NOT FOR THE TRANSFER! (3 STARS FOR THE MOVIE ITSELF NOT THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS HD DVD)
1 ||| It does not even come close to Fallen!! True, Amy Lee's voice is excellent, but the band itself is lost in the background. The music is so slow, lyrics good, but could use more fast music. I like only three songs on this CD and I am afraid I will not play it like Fallen. I wore out three copies of Fallen and to this day it is still one of my favorite cd's. True, Amy Lee is beautiful and so is her voice, but what happen to the music!!!!
0 ||| I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005. The rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why I purchased this. However, the wall of the tubing is made from incredibly thin brass and will bend if you hang a wet towel on it. The chrome plating is also of poor quality. For $100, you would think this would be top quality. Don't waste your money on this item.
0 ||| I've bought several of this kind of Command Damage-Free Hanging hooks. The latest one claims to hold up to 3 lb. I tried twice, followed the instructions carefully plus pressed for twice as long and waited for twice as long as well. Still the hook fell off by itself after half an hour, from an 4-oz piece of cloth.I'm through with this line of products and I think they should recall all their products if they run an ethical business.
4 ||| I've heard a fair number of Tchaikovsy Fifths (Monteux, Karajan, Jansons, Ormandy, Temirkanov, Markevitch, Rostropovich, and Muti/Philharmonia). For me, this joins Monteux's at the head of the list. The "taffy-pulling" that some listeners find objectionable in this performance are the life and breath of Tchaikovsky, and Muti does it better than most. If metronomic Tchaikovsky appeals to you (why?), try Ormandy or Jansons. This is a beauty, expertly paced, warm and romantic without bathos, and the price is embarassingly low-what are you waiting for?
3 ||| Again if you like his writing style you will enjoy reading this one...It's a great story about man Vs. the powers of nature
0 ||| Expensive , but wonderful design, until the monitor goes out after 2.5 years, and it will cost $800 for a new one. Sony parts are out of this world in price, and most repair people say it will cost more that it's worth. It doesn't have any place to add another monitor to even check it out.
3 ||| I think this carry case is a good buy. The only down side is the bag doesnt have enough room to carry all of the plugs and av wires and accessories.
3 ||| I'll be concise: This is socially conscious, political lyrics set to hard beats. Its as good or better than "Let's Get Free" Get it.
2 ||| What bothered me the most about this movie was the lack of plot. I know it hinges a bit on sci-fi, but not only was it hard to follow, it was not very believable.Character development was definitely left by the wayside in the director's quest to dazzle us with special effects and explosive scenes.Rachel Weisz' character was so far removed from her first appearance in The Mummy that I found a hard time believing it. Gone was the slightly ditzy Evie of before, and I found myself wishing to see a bit of it here and there in the second offering.But their son Alex was a delight. I loved his character.I think the director could have made this into a lot better movie by writing a better plot, fleshing out the characters better, and adding more believability to the entire thing.It's worth watching, but I have to agree, if you've seen the first one, this one will not meet your expectations. The first one was by far better.
3 ||| I like the size of this tool for my particular application, but it is starting to rust after only 6 weeks.
3 ||| I bought a WUSB11 to hook up my Windows 2000 PC to my wireless LAN (using Linksys wireless access point).Setup was very straight forward - per instructions I ran the program on the CD-Rom to install the drivers, then plugged the device in.Although I don't move my desktop machine around much, nor do I move the access point, I've never seen the signal strength fall below 97%. The device is about 25 feet and one wall removed from the access point.The design of this device is very sleak. Dimensionally, its about the size of a deck of cards. The only cable is the USB cable to the computer - there is no power cable required and, just as important, no need to take up a socket on your powerstrip with a plug from this guy.The one negative is that once I added this device to my home network, the Linksys wireless card I use in my laptop seemed to get a much lower signal strength from the access point. I can't help but wonder if somehow the WUSB11 signal is so strong that it interferes?
2 ||| these are very well made and are a beautiful color pink, but the ankles are way too small for my baby. her little foot fits fine, but the hook-and-loop closure on the ankle doesn't adequately reach around her chubby little ankles. i don't think she is unusually large. the doctor said she's 30th percentile in weight and height. they might work better with an older child that doesn't have baby-ish ankles. i sure wish they worked because they look great and are of great quality.
2 ||| They went into hyper drove with the sequel to the classic Terminator movie. Big effects, big story, big set pieces, big budget, big cheeze. This film loses the serious feel that made the first film so good. On its own it plays as a fun enough action flick. But the kids does ruin the film. Jason Patrick is excellent though, I must give him props.
3 ||| This looks like a promising new series to watch for. For those who like period mysteries, this author is definitely a good one to keep in mind. The setting in late 18 century Philedelphia is different, but a good one just the same. I like the hero - McLeary is a believable and entertaining narrator. I look forward to seeing more from Mr. Graham
4 ||| This is a timeless Christmas classic that still brings a lump to your throat. The music from this special is wonderful as well. A classic!
3 ||| Although this book was often a little too abstract for me, it was nevertheless not completely useless. For example, I especially liked Bonder's treatment of difference. On the one hand, he emphasizes the value of being able to honor the differences that are part of nature. But at the same time, Bonder notes, rancor can arise from "a lack of sensitivity when expressing our differences in others"- a betrayal of harsh truths, or a tactless overemphasis on difference.
3 ||| Black Sabbath remains the standard to which I judge the heavy side of rock music...they were and are unparalled. The first "Nativity in Black" is an awesome cd...a great tribute to a band that has inspired many of todays heavier bands. I couldn't wait for "Nativity II". Got it...like it a lot. It is more interpretive than the first. For example, just as I started to get depressed with a couple of the songs openings all of a sudden they took off in classic Sabbath style.....wall of sound awesome. Then there are many great semi-straight remakes, like Megadeath's "Never Say Die". This song alone makes this a CD worth buying..that good. Not every song is what you'd expect, but a true Sabbath fan will love it all. I'm glad there is a Sabbath to tribute, and many of us who love them.
4 ||| The Catholic Faith Handbook For Youth is a basic guidebook concerning all things Catholic. Intended for young adults, yet accessible to anyone who may be fuzzy on the details of Catholicism, The Catholic Faith Handbook For Youth covers creed, sacraments, morality, and prayer, along with articles concerning information on current events from a Catholic point of view, advice for prayer, profiles of thirty-seven Catholic saints, notes on the history of the Catholic Church, and more. Full-color illustrations pepper this highly readible introduction to a spiritual way of life. Especially recommended reading to share with one's preteen and teenage children in order to teach them more about Catholicism and what it means to live one's life by Catholic religious principles.
3 ||| They were shipped promptly. I wear a 10 D in most shoes & that's what I ordered. A little big. If you can go a 1/2 size smaller I would. The lining on the inside's a little thin but about right for the price. Be careful how you choose your shipping method. Usually the cheapest method is either preselected or at the top of the shipping options. This one had the most expensive preselected & on top.
1 ||| OK...So. We finally get an region 1 release of the "extended" version of the film. Along with the theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars, and that's also where the good review ends.Where the hell are the special features? There's enough information about the Dune story to fill a Lord of the Rings style 4 disc box set. Yet here all we get is a handful of nonsense. The special features seem more like highlights from a longer set of features. For christ sake the longest one clocks in at a whopping 7 mins, and change, in length. My copy of Half Baked has better, and more in depth, special features.I felt incredibly cheated after having watched this dvd. If you've never seen the extended version of Dune, pick it up just for that. Otherwise give it a pass, or buy it used.PS.Why couldn't they do DTS audio for at least the theatrical version? Even Dawn Of The Dead got DTS for it's re-release.
0 ||| We had a series of light snows. I guess the post office couldn't get their feet wet. They sent it back as undeliverable. Thanks Mr. Postal.
2 ||| The first half of Dario Argento's hypnotic thriller is on a par with some of his early giallo classics, but then it slips a notch, becoming a rather routine slasher/revenge movie that borrows heavily from Ms. 45 and Psycho. The viewer is forced to wait for the film to ackowledge what the genre savy will, no doubt, already know in its remaining hour. The ending is atypically gentle for an Argento outing, perhaps he's getting mellow in his old age. Ennio Morricone's score is suitably chilling, the soundtrack is worth seeking out.
0 ||| I purchased an eight pack of batteries for two Canon flashes. This product is always the first to lose the power. I have other rechargeable brands that last days longer. I don't know if I got a bad batch of these batteries or not. As it is I would never purchase this brand of rechargeable batteries again.
0 ||| Ditto to the last upgrade review. It's a neat little machine when it does what you want. But...Did you know that they have radio in Korea (I was handily informed of this by Jeff at Pogo)?And, you can take it to Europe where they have different channel spacing (if you spend the extra $10).They want me to send in the unit and charge me $10, and I just bought mine 10 days ago. Don't believe that all the units out there now are the latest version! There's no way to tell without opening the box and Pogo doesn't seem to care unless you bought it from them.They felt they were doing me a favor by telling me about the updated firmware -- hey, they could have kept a secret. Maybe they should have. Of course, then I found these reviews.
1 ||| Ok so Bruce looks fab naked and not afraid to slobber in every scene and act barbaric, guess those goons from the future will do that to ya... the whole timeline is absurd, conflicting, and arbitrary so I assume the confusion masks the weak script... the long protracted chase scenes were unbearable and just wanted to see more action and lead flying.... a Brad Snatch teaser imho, coulda done w/o his input but a headliner nonetheless... Madeline looks gorgeous as a blond and Bruce with a wig is hot! incessant discomfort, discord and disorientation makes for commercial yearning.... GEICO! ;}}
3 ||| Given the multiple reviews, I really only wish to comment on one aspect of the film, but one that is at it's heart. In the real world there really are people like the town bullies/thugs. Wherever found, their existence needs to be ended. In this film, after multiple points where this termination of existence should have occured, it finally does. D. goes from nothing to warrior. Not an animal in any way. A dangerous, thinking exterminator of evil. A good and honorable function. A necessary function.
3 ||| I felt this study guide was a great addition to my library of books. It not only helped my nephew study for his Math A test, it helped him with his studies during class. This is an excellent review guide that falls just short of perfection. Some of the explanations were not thorough and tough to understand. This is the only flaw. And mind you this is only on a FEW of the explanations, not all. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who is planning on taking the Math A exam or if you just need help understanding whats going on in class!
1 ||| Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg was featured on 60 Minutes as the untrammeled artist who couldn't be stopped, the underdog who swooned and swayed onstage, lost in her expressive rapture. That's what her fans expect, and she more or less lives up to the image here. This is very wayward playing, in which the soloist bends over backwards to keep the spotlight on herself. As a result of ignoring the composer, the score is pulled around like taffy.Perhaps this is the new romanticism, and I would be thrilled if NSS's ideas were fascinating. But on the whole she swoops and exaggerates for no other purpose than ego display. There are breathless pauses and sudden leaps of excitement that make no sense. Tilson Thomas plays along by forgetting the tempo and waiting for his soloist to get through her next stunt.It's funny, because I am all in favor of NSS's shtick about artistic freedom, but this junky Sibelius concerto is her personal trip, pure and simple.
0 ||| Once again the debilitating disease of genre-itis infects another film production. Film companies seem incapable - due to the bottomless idiocy of distributors (and themselves) - to consider making any film which doesn't conform completely to a specific genre. So here we have a typical road movie: contrived, impossible to believe in or care about, dull, predictable and badly acted by third division actors. No great dialogue, no clever or inventive plotting, no laughs, no action, no emotions...just a banal, depressing trawl through middle American "culture", conducted by actors who seem to have had a charisma bypass operation. I've seen hatstands with more screen presence. My advice: avoid this dross.
2 ||| The book was ok and I did finish reading but was a little too predictable and not always believeable. I read to be entertained so, for the price, it did the job. Not something I would read again.
1 ||| Got this yesterday and played it all night. There are quite a few bugs and zero on-line support as of yet. They either don't do the damage they claim or it doesn't register. Cluster Bombs are cool but also don't appear to register the stated amount of damage. The install overwrites your joystick settings that you set up with the MW4 patch 2 version 2. Switching from chain fire to group fire etc doesn't "stick" and you have to keep re-switching. It may have been coincidence but after installing last night I tried a multiplayer session and we were ghosting and warping so badly that we couldn't play. I'll try it again but we didn't have that kind of trouble previously.
2 ||| "The Invisible Ghost" (1941) features an effectively underplayed Bela Lugosi performance and some striking directorial touches courtesy of Joseph H. Lewis - eight years before his cult classic "Gun Crazy." As a result, this atmospheric thriller rises above the usual Poverty Row fare. Clarence Muse provides memorable support as the non-stereotypical butler. One of Lugosi's best Monogram efforts. The Roan Group DVD includes a good 35mm print and the original trailer.
2 ||| Liked it. Didn't love it. Liked it. Worth watching? Yes. Worth buying? Perhaps? Does it make me think? Yes. John Goodmen's best acting job ever? Yes. Captivating? Absolutely.Now, those question having been answered, I'd like to let you in on something - this film is not for everyone. It will keep everyone on the edge of their, waiting for the next squence to hint something at us. Well, we get plenty of hints, but when it's all said and done, we are basically left to decide what this film meant.Category person A: Will not like how this film ended and will utterly be left puzzled.Category person B: Will figure it all out and love it.Category person C: (the one I'm in) Will want to watch it again, this time with a prepared mind.This is a solid film and one that will certainly make everyone think.Score by Carter Burwell is solid as well.
3 ||| If you like manga / comics, this will be a feast.All-boy, all under Californian shiny skies, playing innocently with one another with skates, surfboards, cars, etc. You fel like joinig them in this outdoor, happy world...A definite keep!
0 ||| Overblown dramatic moments interspersed between Ms. Hawn's costume changes. I prefer her in comedies. This movie has all the wooden dialogue and clunky plot of a made-for-tv movie.
1 ||| This film is a situation comedy based on laughing at people in awkward situations. If you have a taste for that kind of thing than this movie is for you. Otherwise forget it.
0 ||| This book makes no sense. It is overwhelmingly confusing. Simple problems are made much harder than they should ever be for no reason. Save your money.
3 ||| An excellent doumentary of the history of Cuba's typical music. As a child, my mother introduced me to this cultural delicacy, from the times when she used to be a flamenco dancer and singer in Spain and later in Cuba b.c. (before castro). These typical salsa/island rythems and the quality of the documentary in the style of Wim Wenders and Ry Cooder are no surprise that the music won a Grammy. The local shots of Havana in 1998 make you wonder how our neighbors to the south can live in such terrible conditions and still play such happy music.The economic conditions typified in in the film depict present-day Cuba and give creedence to the saying that only the good die young- reason for why castro is still in power and still alive after so many years of his nonsense and dictatorship.Definitely worth 101 minutes of your time!
0 ||| Earlier this year, Lomborg was discredited by his academic peers for his selective and incomplete science. He is a statistician, not a scientist, and certainly not an environmental scientist. Read this book only as an example of how clever statistical methods can be used to create a profitable product for a niche market.
1 ||| We bought this machine a year ago and have kept it because we paid so much for it. Sure it is easy to use, but the coffee is never hot enough. Within the first 15 min of it being made it is sort of hot, never piping hot, and an hour after it is made it is only warm. Today the twist on top to the carafe broke and we are so happy to have an excuse to buy a new coffee maker. For sure it will NOT be a Zojirushi.
4 ||| I am 17 and it is now my favorite book. Ayn Rand's beliefs are timeless and still prevalent in today's society even though she wrote it in the 1950's. The best part is that she shares her philosophy by creating an epic novel. It is a must read!!
4 ||| I have been collecting blackjack books for the past 25 years and this one is the best.Why? Beacause it introduces the simplest effective card counting system devised to date. The writing is clear , the instructions are precise and above all the system is simple relative to others.Absorbing the material will take time but you will be well rewarded if you succeed. If you progressto "full" matrix indices ,buy James Grosjean s book Beyond Counting and see if you want to lern soft doubling indices as well
3 ||| Remembering whether I read this before or not was difficult so I purchased it for my Kindle & loved every page of it.
4 ||| This book is very informative, allowing a beginner (or more advanced member) of the craft to gather knowledge on commonly used implements/herbs/etc.
4 ||| The mere fact that it has received some 1 star reviews and some 5 star reviews shows that it is a controversial book. Liberals will hate it and conservatives will find great no-nonsense descriptions of the philosophies we uphold so strongly. His writing style makes it a relatively easy read for anyone.
3 ||| These movies, produced so long ago, make great family films with alot of great character actors, action, and funny situations that will keep children laughing the entire time. Unfortunately there aren't too many G rated movies that you can allow the entire family to enjoy. This is one of the funniest.
4 ||| I'll have to agree with the other reviewer that Men's Jounal may not be quite as good as it used to be. But it is still the best men's magazine around IMO. Flip through the other men's magazine fodder at the grocery store or your buddy's place, and save your money for a subscription to Men's Journal.
4 ||| But, consider the number of years it is good for, I'd say the cost averages out just fine. Fit, form, and function are all good.
1 ||| I read that Aliens like to do Anal probes so I thought if I hid this in my Bum I could detect them before the got me. Well needless to say I am writing this on my way to Epsolon Epsolon Ack Ack Bivivito 7. I am amazed at how good the Interweb is in space but disappointed that the detection kit did not work as intended.
2 ||| While I am a Shania fan, and I loved the energy of the group, the show, and the songs on this DVD, the sound quality leaves me wanting and wishing. There is way too much crowd noise (for home viewing) for my tastes, and much of the bands music and her vocals are overpowered by the huge crowd and their noisy enthusiasm. It's not the sound quality we've come to expect from DVD.While it's not a dud, it's not equal to a Celine Dion (Colour of My Love)live concert performance--which sounds nearly like studio work--with some audience sounds nicely wrapping (not over powering) the performance.Overall, I'm a little disappointed, and looking forward to the Shania Live: Visual DVD release December 21st.
1 ||| Imagine yourself sitting on a theatre seat and staring at the stage where a bunch of names handwritten on a piece of cardboard paper boldly by the same person, are going back and forth to bigger carboard written names like "England, America, Roma, Florence" endlessly and a dubbed voice talking over them boring you to death. This is how i feel reading this book. A portrait for 700 pages for god's sake! A casual neighborhood rumor or playing pac man can give you much more literary pleasure than this one. If you are over 30 don't waste your time with this.
4 ||| Not only is this FAST & EASY, it tastes great! Add a cup of chicken, carrots chopped onion & celery and you have a great casserole.
4 ||| I love the anime series as a teen in 2000 and owning this series brought up some great memories. Its awesome. This completed my series collection. The product arrived in excellent condition and is a great part of my dvd collection.
2 ||| I have liked Dido, eversince she released the single from the album "No Angel" which was "Thank You" and "Hunter". After then, I watched her mature and become famous. Later on, she followed up with a worthy offering called "Life For Rent". The first single was a smash! "White Flag". This song has it all, a great melody, fantastic lyrics topped over with Dido's youthful, unique, and angelic voice. The singer is gorgeous as well but It's that voice that got me hooked all over! She is no Tina Arena or Celine Dion, but her voice has a distinct sound that cannot be compared to those high pitched divas.
4 ||| I am still amazed at HBO's decision to cancel "JFC", and yet the exceedingly boring "Big Love" continues to get renewed. I wish another network (Showtime)would pick this up. The characters draw you in, and soon enough your part of this compelling journey. I have NEVER been so moved by a television series. Mr. Milch, how can you let this go?
3 ||| Whether or not you're interested in this particular album depends on a lot on whether you're interested in Traffic. But if you're a Traffic fan, be sure you get the 2003 remaster rather than any other CD version. That's because the remaster includes the full-length versions of "Roll Right Stones" and "(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired." Besides this remaster and the earliest (U.S.?) LP copies, ALL copies of SHOOT OUT have shortened versions of these songs. "Uninspired" was faded out just a little early (about 15 seconds), but "Roll Right Stones" lost a full 2 minutes. The 2003 remaster is the ONLY place to get the full-length versions on CD.I don't know why none of this was pointed out in any advertising for the remaster or in its liner notes.(P.S.: Note that a few of the reviews here are referring to CD editions that contain the shorter versions of these songs. The full, remastered version of the album is longer than 37:39, for example.)
3 ||| It is weird how they mix such totally different artists. I prefer the Pop music (NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, etc.),and I don't really like the "rap/R&B" on the cd. Other than that, I love the cd! Warning: there are a few lyrics on the cd that parents may not enjoy (ex: Shaggy - It wasn't me)!
4 ||| This book is worth reading even if someone else is trailering your horse. Discusses options for trailers layout, and towing vehicles. Focuses on the safety and comfort of both humans and equines when heading out on the road.
2 ||| Memento [Blu-ray]I purcahsed this dvd for my son-in-law for a Christmas gift. He loved it. It was delivered in a timely manner.
2 ||| This album is even more hit-and-miss than Entering Marion. Only a few songs (most notably "The Juice a la Seuss") really hit the funny bone; the rest seem overlabored ("Type A", Spores) or just too long for the slight subject matter (Figaro Todd, Helium).And for some reason, the lyrics to "Robert Moses" don't stick in my head at all. I had to listen to the song 5 times just to figure out what he was trying to poke fun of...At any rate, it's very literally a "sophomore" album-- hopefully the next few albums will graduate John Forster into the realm of the great comedy songwriters. For now, this is mediocre, with a few highlights.
3 ||| I searched for a long time to find a PDA. I did not need something with all the fancy features, just something to keep my appointments and to-do list. The Palm m500 does just that. I am fortunate because I decided to buy a refurbished m500. Most I looked at were $100 minimum and I found mine for $20. It is a great product for $20, do not spend any more than that! It is not worth it! It is a basic unit that was difficult to sync to my computer. This would be equivalent to paying $100 or more for a VCR. As far as me buying a refurbished m500, I got what I expected. A few scratches on the back, the screen was fine, and one of the scroll buttons does not work. No manual came with it, but that was easily remedied by going to the Palm website and downloading one. The m500 works great, it just isn't worth paying the big bucks. For most people, their smart phone will do what they want. My preference is to have something separate.
3 ||| Much of the material is familiar to me as I recall reading a book about King Kong back in the 90's that was a lot like this one. I do not recall the other book's title but I feel certain this book deliberately draws heavily from it. This book goes back and forth between the different Kong films a little too much (it would have been better to keep the descriptions of the films in more sequential order) but it is very imformative just the same.
1 ||| A short review....I think that anyone who rates this above three stars has not seen the first three seasons for comparison. I do hope that season seven does not end up like this. Ridiculous plots and Michael Scott a letch and out of control... This is not the Office seasons of old. Buyer Beware!
3 ||| I had to have this book for my collection of Little House books. The colored illustrations are wonderful. The only fault I found was that there are a few errors with spelling and editing.
1 ||| I'll get to the point: This book is a waste of time for readers who already have some introduction to baseball and gambling and are looking to get a winning edge. If you are looking for bet ideas from a winning gambler that are shown to statistically outperform the casino odds historically, look elsewhere.Instead you will find a handful of bet ideas, lost in a sea of painfully detailed play-by-play summaries of the events of the 2004 season, tied together clumsily by a universal idea of "military maxims". The bet ideas are justified with some general commentary followed by "here's one time that the bet worked in the 2004 season", which goes on for pages and is hardly convincing. The misspellings are frequent and get annoying.In summary, you don't need to pay 14 bucks for detailed summaries of the 2004 season - go to espn.com.
2 ||| Typical of hollywood in these times. Special effects and mediocre acting. Once again it is shown that you cannot remake a legendary IP. When will hollywood do something original? If you are a collector and its the only one missing from your collection then buy it if you must and watch it if you dare. This one was most certainly not made for Star Trek fans.
2 ||| The Roomba battery is fine. Not as long lasting as I would have preferred, but I guess you get what you pay for.
2 ||| Not a bad product for the price. Tends to kink and tangle easily. Nice and flexible. Light weight makes it easy to drag around behind a nail gun.
2 ||| This is a good song, that should have been included on the last album. The Prodigy, Liam to be specific, has said this is not going to be on the new album and have admitted that this is more like their older work. Looking for the older Prodigy, you'll find it here, don't expect the new sound till early next year.
1 ||| This was a gift from my in-laws and I was thrilled to have new salad spinner. I have always had those really old cord ones.Initially it worked really well, but it is hard to clean. You have to disassemble the lid, and it appears the more you do that, the more goes wrong. Eventually the whole thing just stopped working and the lid wouldn't stay together.The older-style pull-cord spinners have fewer parts to break and are easier to clean. Get a Zyliss instead.
0 ||| Okay, this is one of those very very low budget movies with a stupid story line that no one in their right mind would watch for entertainment or any other purposes. The quality of the picture sucks, and the actos are horrendous. The directing is the worst I have ever seen. And the storyline is extremely boring. If you are interested in wasting money on this movie, get it. If you are trying to build a mob movie collection, and you want to have every movie ever made, get it. But if you are a mob movie enthusiast, you are better off watching something else. No one with any taste would watch this movie!
2 ||| Admittedly, I've not done much in astral travel, so this book may not be for beginners - I do believe the author is highly passionate about her writing - VERY! important in any book, it helped keep me reading...i was just a little put off by the "this is what you will see" she seemed to be saying - it seems to offer any "only" solution to what i would see when i'm "silver strung" - she seems to be telling me what i must see, not what i "could" see - i love! her style tho, as i said, very passionate writing!
4 ||| This book is full of philosophical insights. Based on the author's experiences in German concentration camps during the second world war, Viktor Frankl gives the reader a greater understanding of happiness in life by showing how people can find meaning not only through love and serving others, but even through hardship and suffering. He mentions how although the majority of people in the camps became depressed and bitter because of their trials, there were others who preserved a spark of hope by turning their focus of attention outward. This is an inspiring book full of valuable lessons.
2 ||| Don't bother buying this DVD, especially if you already have the VHS version.Don't give the studios money to put out garbage content and charge exorbitant rates for it.I'll buy the DVD when everything is on the one disc... documentaries, both cuts, missing scenes like the hospital scene, even if it is in mono, and for good measure I'd like to see text matter like original movie reviews.Now THAT's worth paying extra money for!
1 ||| Disregarding all my love for Rent on stage, and all my respect for the actors, and yes, even my loathing of Chris Columbus' directorial attempts, the movie just doesn't work. Shots are so tediously placed to be "artistic" that it is distracting, and none of the actors really got their chance to show us their characters. There are some excellent parts (Santa Fe) and some terrible ones (What You Own Britney-style music video) but all in all it is mediochre. If you can't see the show on stage, see the movie. But do not judge the show by it. The experience is so different. I wouldn't recommend the movie to anybody unless they know that they will never get to see it on stage. It just feels flat and forced.Note how Roger and Mark throw their papers into the trash can to heat up their apartment. Then they grab hold of the aluminum can with their bare hands and toss the fire out the window. That is just something useless and distracting. The movie almost gets it right.
2 ||| I don't have the DVD. I'm reviewing the video tape put out by Goodtimes Home Video, it contains the pilot movie that started the television program Little House on The Prairie is one of my favorite shows. This Goodtimes tape is okay but kind of grainy and not of the best quality. Complete seasons of Little House on the Prairie have been put on DVD and I had thought of getting them but I read complaints that they aren't the complete episodes as they originally aired on NBC in the 1970's but taken from the syndication TV edits and if that is true I'm very disappointed. Can someone say if that rumour is true or if some bozo just made up a lie that thy aren't the complete episodes?
4 ||| When Laurence Olivier introduced this film at the midnight screening in London he said: "It is the best ensemble acting since Citizen Kane." After seeing this film today I couldn't agree more. Astonishing performances by Ben Gazzara, George Peppard, Pat Hingle, Mark Richman (The Strange One was their film debut!) and brilliant direction by Jack Garfein.
1 ||| Only a couple of washings and the threads just keep unraveling; snags easily. Only lasted less than a year. Now I am looking for a qualitly robe that will last, LL Bean!
4 ||| I ordered these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They look great and are true to size. He said he wishes these shoes had more arch support because he has to wear insoles, but that is typical of this particular shoe.
1 ||| When ordering I would suggest you consider a size smaller than what you generally wear. Not having a product specific size chart available here does not help. My poor rating is more influenced by the fact that the cloth used is quite thin and does not look like it will hold up to regular wear beyond a few months. Will post an update on the shorts longevity in around six months.
2 ||| The keyboard portion of this adapter only works with slower human input. The adapter will drop characters when a device, like a barcode scanner, sends key strokes too quickly. Other brands will buffer the input but not this one.
1 ||| While the Littlest Pet Shop toys are cute, this electronic version is just a knock off of the Tamagotchi.
0 ||| This movie is fine if all you want is a costumed drama, but since I've very familiar with the actual history, I found the liberties taken with historical fact absolutely unconscionable. If Elizabeth I were alive today, she could sue for libel. Go back to Glenda Jackson for real historical drama.
0 ||| Tiny (God rest his soul, must be long gone by now. His guitar playing reminded me of what one Roy Clark special ($29.99) plus shipping and handling must have sounded like in the hands of a beginner. Not even Hawkins and Bryant help this one out. Another Prestige from the late 50"s that should have been left in the Fantasy vault. While alive Tiny should have listened to one of the new guitarists at his time that he liked Johnny Smith whose recordings at about the same time put this one to shame. If you like guitar in the hands of a master, get his Moonlight in Vermont cd and skip good old Tiny.
1 ||| Some of the previous books moved at a slow pace, like some other reviewers, I was hoping for the pace to pick up after the end of Winter's Heart. Instead we get a book that does not advance the plot AT ALL. With only one or two minor, minor exceptions, all characters are in EXACTLY the same position as at the end of the last book. How can this happen? All of that being said, the quality of writing is consistant, and if we didn't have to wait two years between each new book, I probably wouldn't have minded this at all.Note to Mr. Jordan: FINISH THE STORY!
0 ||| I needed to extend my usb cable and this does not recognize my iPhone or a few other electronic products. I would confirm with seller it is compatible before buying.
4 ||| Prepared by the organization that writes the ACT. As a teacher who helps prep students for the college admissions tests, I know what most students are willing to do. Hours of study and review over a long period of time may be the ideal, but it is an unrealistic ask of most teenagers. Their most efficient use of time is to take practice tests and then look over the problems missed. This book has real questions direct from the source combined with good explanations of all answers. The overall review sections are short and to the point. Students may take practice tests one section at a time to avoid burnout (but must understand why they missed each question). A few hours spent preparing with this method will raise scores, probability of admission to certain schools and the amount of scholarship money a student is likely to earn.
4 ||| The 303 is a great ladder. It is top heavy when fully extended with the wall standoff and I'd recommend having two people when working with it this way. In all other cases, the ladder is very easy to work with and very easy to configure. The ladder is very solidly built and wobbled very little when fully extended. As an A-frame, it is rock-solid. It also stores easily, more easily than my ordinary six-foot ladder.The work platform is a must if you plan on using the ladder as an A-frame and want a place to rest a can of paint. It is designed to handle up to 300 lbs. and looks like it could handle more.For the average homeowner, I would stick with the 203 or 303. The 103 really is overkill for a non-professional and the extra weight I think would make it more of a hassle, especially with the wall standoff.
2 ||| If you are wanting to learn perl, this book will help you do that. It jumps in quickly into how to code perl, so be prepared. If you have coded C++, then this perl won't be that hard with this book. However, if you've never programmed before, then this is not the book for you.Once I had learned perl, I found this book to be a 500 page paper weight. It does little good as a reference.
3 ||| Although some times a slow story, this classic book honors the never-ending cult to Count Dracula. A must read for everybody.
1 ||| I'm not without humour however, I do know humour. This book simply leaves something to be desired. Its not terrible but more importantly, its not that great. It has been touted as laugh out loud funny, but it lacks the ability to, in most places, crack a smile. Don't waste your time or prepare yourself for a dissapointment. If you lower your expectations then you can be better prepared for "laugh inside, without smiling" funny.
0 ||| My favorite thing about this phone is the ability to use "In Da Club" as my ring tone. Unfortunately, that's all I like.For the first 3 weeks, it's fine...Then everything falls apart. The screen turns off, the antenna falls off, it switches to analog mode for no reason, the battery dies faster than most non-viagra users and the WORST thing is its refusal to charge. This piece of junk is so temperamental, you have to plug it in 12-17 times in order to get it to charge. Then 1-3 times a week, it will wait until you fall asleep, THEN stop charging - leaving you with a useless paperweight for your long day at work. And forget about replacing it, I've had 7 in the past year and they ALL fall apart. Plus, your wireless provider will pull some crap about "warranty periods" and "upgrade charges" even though your *most recent* phone is only a month old. Stay Away...far, far away.
3 ||| I saw this at the iMax with some friends with very low expectations. The movie itself was good escapist entertainment and predictable. The blu-ray itself was a good transfer and has some good extras. I'd rent before buying but if you're not expecting a Pixar quality film you probably won't be too disappointed with this film.
3 ||| When I bought this I thought I would primarily use it for chopping. Instead, I use it more after chopping with the knife to quickly and efffectviely transfer things from the cutting board to the pan. It can certainly chops many things but it is not a substitute for a knife. It is also solidly made. Good utility tool but if you only have money for a good knife, get that.
2 ||| I bought this magnetic card/cribbage set for my Dad to use on the porch at his lake front home. I can blow the cards off of the playing surface with little more difficulty than a regular, non-magnetized deck. Also, the deck of cards came unsecured, just loose in the bag containing the board. None of them were bent or damaged but I think this was just luck. Would not recommend.
4 ||| This game is so great for many reasons. It teaches cooperation as everyone has to take turns and work together to plant the garden before the sun sets. It teaches directions; I sometimes go over clockwise and counter-clockwise with the kids before the game. It helps with imagination, you can make up your own poses. It helps with self esteem, everyone gets a chance to be the teacher by doing the pose first. There is counting as kids hold the pose, we all count. It teaches motor skills - moving around the board as well as throwing the die. It teaches simple, fun yoga poses so there is movement within the game. I think 6 players would be the maximum because little kids get bored if they have to wait too long for their turn. You can also stop in the middle of the game and practice other yoga poses then go back and finish the game. Namaste!
2 ||| Nas is definitely better that Jay-z, and his flow on "Last real nigga alive" implements that. "Thug's mansion" and track 2 are also heavy rotations that deserve alot of time in the CD player. The rest of the album is mediocore at best, if not better, than some of his other albums.
0 ||| Santana fue, uno de los mas grandes guitarristas que pudo dar aqui mexico, desde Autlan, jalisco. Emigrado a Estados Unidos, creo su primer disco Homonimo y saco ms discos maravillosos como: "Abraxas" y "Caranaverasai". Despues de casi dos decadas, a finales de los 90, decide sacar otros discos.Pero, seguramente, como por falta de dinero o fama(Cosa que ya no le hacia falta el talento)Decidio triztemente irse hacia el pop. Y esto es lo que tenemos: Un disco que quiere pasar por ser cool(Lo que se salva es la compa√±ias en el disco de Dido y Seal) con super-grandes invitados, y con el gran hit, llamado "game of love" Dizque muy romanticona...Si se convierte asi, pronto hara dueto con Luis Miguel O la Britney.¬øQue paso Santana nuestro? ¬øYa no te acuerdas de tus hermanos del Woodstock?¬øTe olvidastes de "Smba pa, ti" y "Black magic woman"? Hay una razon: El mundo del pop, te ha invadido. Salvate...
1 ||| An old man goes out to sea and beats and abuses and kills all these different sea creatures for days... What a masterpiece!!! I wanted the old [...] to fall out of the boat and get eaten by sharks...
2 ||| I've never been a huge fan of Obituary, or many other death metal bands for that matter, but some of there music is very groove laden and catchy. Much of what they use to do is what they do in this return to reform album. The guitar's are nothing amazing (actually pretty basic 3 chord riffs when you get down to it) but hey isn't what we loved about Black Sabbath(who is still my favorite band). This music has great production and the guitar sound production is impecable, and also the singer isn't quite as annoying as he once was, he even has more of a hardcore edge on this album which doesn't make it seem quite so outdated.So in closing average metal from a solid death metal band who still has some good tunes under there belt and are joining the ranks of many other fine metal bands that are returning to form. Any metal these days to me is good metal. Even if its not super technical.
0 ||| I've always wondered what about this book makes it a classic so I borrowed it from a friend and got ready to be entertained. But I was sorely and thoroughly dissappointed. I can't believe this guy actually suckered a publishing house into actually printing this piece of garbage. Unles they did it as an example of just how NOT to write a book. There is no plot, no real character development and the language is instantly droll. If I hadn't borrowed this book I would have been angry at having been swindled out of good money. Don't waste your time.
0 ||| This item is not nearly big enough for a single betta fish to live happily. They require AT LEAST 2.5 US gallons, a heater and a filter, and bettas are pretty tough fish. Please do not buy this to put a fish in.
0 ||| I bought this because it was free shipping with PRIME. We went to set it up for the first time and had the plastic poles split where they have the little push button connector. They aren't very sturdy. I will know the next time to buy steel poles.
2 ||| The best songs on this album are Find myself, let us prey, the new shout, anybody out there,flush and generation swine. the rest of the songs are weak in my opinion.The songs find myself and Prey are industrial-heavy metal thunder. It sounds like a mix of NINE INCH NAILS, METALLICA AND Zombie. If u do not like the above bands then this album is not for you.All in all this is an experimental album.
3 ||| With Heathen, Bowie brings a knowing, polished maturity to his late 60's to mid 70's style. At this point, his subtle sophistication has become quite powerful. Of course, with his maturity, we will find a lack of driving energy or flamboyant risk taking. This is a mature rocker showing why he's a master. This album will get zero airplay on commercial radio. But for dedicated Bowie fans, many of whom are almost as old as Bowie, I think most will feel Bowie has reached his pinnacle with this album.
2 ||| It should have ended at the point of intermission. The last half of the movie made it unbelievable, and I did not appreciate the terrorist element in it. I was hoping for just a love story.
4 ||| This is one of those books that will leave you amazed at what you didn't know. Life on our continent before Columbus was so much more than I had ever realized before books like Mann's and Jarrod Diamond's work.Most library's carry this one, but it would make an excellent gift for the history geek in your family.
1 ||| If you think that's a recommendation, you will probably enjoy this obvious and amateurish movie. The second star is for Eugene Levy's funny performance as the the lead idiot's father, and for the storyline about the jock-turned-singer which was the only interesting part of the plot. Fast Times at Ridgemont High is still the best in this genre.
0 ||| Ugh, probably every generation thought it was the greatest. While this book is highly popular because it caters to the current generation, it is hardly objective or researched in comparing it to other generations. What is the measure of greatenss? If it is number of lives given for one's country, then surely the Civil War generation gave much more and at a greatest cost to family. If it is technology, then surely it is the current generation. Brokaw never mentions that this same generation produced the nazis and the repressive values that decimated American families once the war was over. I think the book needs to be toned down and put in its proper perspective.
4 ||| Like The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror, this is based on actual events and let me tell you, it is VER SCARY! Despite the hammy ending, this film is solid gold and is a REAL ZOMBIE FLICK! Wes Craven does it again! I hope his new movie They will be even better than this and his masterpiece Nightmare on Elm Street. This is a must see for horror buffs that like scares and not gore! Also check out another fact based horror movie like The Entity, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Possessed. WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!
1 ||| Epson's ink is great but very expensive! I use a continuous flow system for my printer from MIS. Just Google "MIS" . (Midwest Ink Supply).
0 ||| After I installed 8.0 I had to reinstall 7.0 to get my previous Video Wave projects to work correctly. First, 8.0 would not display any text added on the overlay line. When I double-clicked the overlay, I could not edit the text, which was invisible. Also, the "pan and scan" that replaced the "motion pictures" edit was a huge disappointment. Even in advanced mode, Roxio seems to have simplified the process so that it actually does less than it did before: you cannot conveniently adjust the slide duration here, you cannot zoom in as far as before; and the pre-set "start" and "end" points are quirky to override and the scan point settings sometimes seem to have a mind of their own. I loved it the way the "edit motion pictures" function was before and was hoping that in the new release that you'd be able to ROTATE the panning frame as well. What I didn't expect was a dumbed-down version of what worked so well before. Maybe I ought to go pro.
3 ||| I've been thinking and pondering about what I've read in this book. There is a deep challenge here and a reflective, curious integration with Christianity, history, nationalities, animal types and typologies. If you are interested / excited about self discovery and going deeper as a searcher, I would recommend this to you
4 ||| A bunch of British friends, who are outwardly proud of being single, but inwardly are looking for their perfect match are attending a wedding almost every weekend - including shy Charlie who falls in love with an impossible American woman, his redheaded flat mate named Scarlett, and a mutual friend who secretly loves Charlie.The only thing wrong with this delightful DVD set is the lack of any special feature whatsoever.
3 ||| I found this on Napster back in the day. Was pleasantly surprised to find it for sale almost a decade later. This sale is a direct result of P2P sharing.AND I like their music.
2 ||| The author has definately given this book the right title. Plainsong. This book was about a few people who had some sort of connection to each other but not in a direct way. The characters were not quite as interesting as they were destitute in some fashion. For instance, Victoria has no family or support, Guthrie has no romantic love, Ike and Bobby have no parental supervision, the McPherons have no life outside of farming. It goes from there. At times I wondered where the story was going... at others I wondered when it would end. I found the most interesting parts involving Victoria and the McPherons. Their relationship was heart warming; the men were very loving in their own way. The one thing I definately liked was the narration. There wasn't the standard quotation marks around the characters dialoge. This made me think it was a story told by some one who was told by someone else and is just repeating it. An interesting view of narration.
4 ||| This is the second in the Travis McGee series, though it doesn't place itself chronologically -- ie, it doesn't refer to the events of the first book, and it does refer to other adventures, as if it's just another in McGee's long life. However, the next book in the series, "A Purple Place for Dying," does take place right after this one, so there is an advantage to reading them in order.In "Nightmare" Travis goes to New York. If you can't deal with that, then this one's not for you, but otherwise it's a knockout. The suspense is great, the philosophizing feels amazingly current, and MacDonald clearly knows New York. The book is great mix of retro setting and modern-feeling plotting and characterization. If anything, it's smoother than "The Deep Blue Good-By," since it doesn't need to introduce anything.The Travis McGee series is terrific. I'm still reading my way through it, but I haven't found any reason not to go in order. "Nightmare in Pink" is great.
3 ||| As a physician who is studying and doing acupuncture, I find this a good basic introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is heavily illustrated, which helps the reader to understand some very difficult concepts, which are alien to the Western mind, especially for medical personnel. I can highly recommend it for someone who is interested in becoming familiar with Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine.
1 ||| I bought this DVD player thinking "Wow. Brand name player at a really good price." Then I got home and used it. Some DVD's played with no problem. But it was more likely that I would see 1 second freezes in the video (not the audio) and sometimes you would get horribly distorted images. Definitely would recommend not buying until GE can get their act together and test their products before selling them.
1 ||| I bought the book hoping to learn how to create pop-up menus. I was disappointed in that respect. I did find it to be a nice guide for using style sheets for specific situations. Readers who do the homework and visit the companion website can pick up tips on getting things done. I would caution against doing everything shown. Many of the tricks require setting specific positions or heights or widths. Such tricks create pages that are not highly maintainable.
2 ||| This movie is about a young lawer trying to get his gramd father out of prison. The grandfather is on death row. In the end ol' grandfather gets gassed. Groos this movie was mot to great but the acting and bachgrounds were great. The plot was the worst ever.
1 ||| This book is filled with a myriad of the strangest named places (often unpronouncable and given two, or three, different regional alternatives), enough historical dates to utterly confuse, peoples, tribes, etc. & a cast of characters larger than any epic. it is a totally confusing work that surely can only be enjoyed by a expert in this field.I am amazed that none of the other reviewers here thought fit to make the point that this book is for the serious student of history. No complaints about the expertise of the author, this is a solid, extremely well researched, history text book. I repeat... a textbook.Warning: if you are reading for enjoyment then please dwell no longer in these pages!
1 ||| Even though I love *Nsync to death, this album did not come out the way I thought. I was hoping for more songs like Bye,Bye, Bye and This I Promise You. Instead we are stuck with 13 songs that all sound alike and not too many love songs. Pop, the first single, is a great song,but all the other songs follow in the same funky style beat. Pop made me believe they were stonger musically. When I listened to the other songs, it sounded as if they were whining about there life and wern't looking for a change.
4 ||| my nephew really liked this gift. i was more challanging and it was different than we have seen around here.
1 ||| Had high hopes for the book, with cartoons and all. But they got into lots of agonizingly boring technical detail without putting it into a clear context. The explanations could have been much clearer by providing that context.
2 ||| I guess I shouldn't expect much out of a product labeled as a "mug warmer" but I was hoping that the temperature of the heating plate would be higher than it actually is.I find that it works best if you do not fill your mug to the brim as the mug is only be able to conduct the heat up to its middle.I have yet to try this but I assume it would also be more effective on mugs that do not have concave bottoms/ends, meaning that the bottom of the mug is directly in contact with the heating plate.Overall, I guess it does it's job. Nothing more, nothing less.
2 ||| These were nice and soft... medium weight. However, after one wash cycle, they have been shedding little fuzzballs on my floors. I would think twice before buying another pair.
1 ||| We lost count of the number of people killed in this supposed comedy. The special effects are pretty good, but the purpose of the movie seems to be to desensitise the audience to violent killings. Also, most of the killings seemed to have little to do with the lengthy story.
4 ||| I bought this DVD 10 years ago and still enjoy it today as much as I did back then. This is a movie that has a lot of fun characters going for it and even with some of the silliness it makes it an entertaining movie to watch. This dvd was a good quality transfer that scales well with modern DVD players that handle the upscaling of the resolution. If you're looking for something entertaining to watch that provides action/comedy and haven't seen this, now is the time.
0 ||| Overuse, and improper use, of language - no starsBoring, one dimensional characters - no starsBoring one dimensional and repetitive plot devices - no starsAbsence of originality, but the weyrcat pretty cool anyway - one starBrom/Eragon relationship okay - one starEragon/Arya relationship (with yucky adolescent wet dreams) - MINUS one star.Getting me to read The Eye of the Wheel - 3 starsHaving my husband leave me annoying voice mail in a deep raspy voice saying "I love you little one" - 5 starsAnd that adds up to one star. No Paolini in my future.
0 ||| One of the first purchases I've ever had to return (...) but this album is of little value. It is comprised primarily of plastic pages that hold 2x2 coin folders into which the coins must be inserted before mounting. They don't mention that these are required but (conveniently!) include an order blank for them. While these are commonly used by coin collectors the beginning collector, who is among the most likely to buy this product, will not likely have them and will be unable to use the album until they are acquired at an additional cost. Not very thoughtful if purchased as a gift! There are several others on the market and any one of them would be a better selection.
1 ||| This make the Vibrams fit too tight, and not to mention they are way over priced. As regular socks they are kinda cool
4 ||| Thanks to amazon.com I found this record. It is one of the rare records you can play over and over without boring. Only this fact merits five stars. It sometimes reminds me to Haris Alexiou (greek female artist). I recommend this CD to anyone who is searching for an intriguing sound not influenced by marketing. I cannot describe, just listen, and you'll know what I mean.
2 ||| This is a reprint of a similar book previously entitled "Clich√©s of Socialism." It is an irreverent collection of 83 right-wing shibboleths, against "socialist tinkering," repackaged as contemporary nuggets of patriotic wisdom. Were it not so obviously politically skewed, this book could be a potentially valuable collectible. However since it is both dated and gores only one side of the "sacred cow," it is much less valuable. Instead of just changing the title, the author should also have changed the content.Arguably, in today's reactionary American culture, which is slowly drifting in the direction of Fascism, and given that Communism is on its last legs, we sorely need a book that explores the clich√©s from the other side of the sacred cow much more than from the side presented here.Still, if one can overlook this built-in bias, there is a great deal of knowledge and truth exposed in analyzing these clich√©s.Three stars
1 ||| The story of this movie is not much at all... actually it is weak and I knew this even before I buy this DVD.But what made it worth buying is to see Demi Moore strip for you... that's it!So if you are a fan of Demi Moore and want to see her strip for you... go for it. If not, don't even consider buying it!
4 ||| This insightful diary by pitcher Jim Brosnan recounts his struggles on the mound for the 1959 St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. Jocks weren't supposed to write books, but this college-educated ballplayer (uncommon in the 1950's) wrote a very good one. Brosnan's mild irreverence annoyed the game's overseers in an era when ballplayers earned modest paychecks and rarely popped off. Older fans may enjoy reading about long-forgotten ballplayers playing in now-demolished ballparks like Forbes Field and Sportsmen's Park. Brosnan followed this book with "Pennant Race," a diary from the 1961 season. Some alledge that the Chicago White Sox tried to insert a clause in Brosnan's contract banning him from publishing anything, while others say he was blackballed from the game after 1963 for his writings. Readers may also enjoy "Ball Four," pitcher Jim Bouton's funny and more combative diary of the 1969 season.
2 ||| I didn't find the book useful because the info is nothing new, it is just written in a grand style using famous people and much embellishment. In fact I found the book boring.On the other hand if you don't have much common sense dealing with people or are very stubborn or self-centered you can pick up some tips. But I'd recommend a modern day book by Ben Stein or others that is lighter and more fun to read.Whoever criticized the book for being manipulative -- you didn't read the book. The author states the points must come from the heart (an attitude adjustment) and not superficial comments to accomplish what you want.Whoever called the book a classic, give me a break.p.s. The author assumes all couples are straight and the husband is the bread winner and the wife stays home and cooks/cleans.
4 ||| My son received the earlier model of this toy before he was born and he wore it out (I purchased it on Ebay). My mother-in-law bought him this newer model and this is one thing we never leave home without. My son is almost 2 now and he still uses it! In the car when we travel, he holds it in his lap and plays the music/ocean sounds or opens the clam in the scene. I wish Fisher Price had chosen a better selection of music but apparantly my son loves it. I find it a little annoying but if I change it to the ocean sounds, he changes it back to the music. Overall, this is one of the best things that was ever purchased for my son.
0 ||| I loved my 5060 until the menu system failed the second time. Just a year after repair and three years of ownership. Dissapointing reliability performance. I don't yet understand how long a digital camera should last. My expectation is 5 years without issues for cameras above $300. That may be unrealistic. I don't love Olympus anymore and poor servcie from a long standing company can not be tolerated by consumers. I will not buy another Olympus until they have proven to be loyal to me and you.
2 ||| Very interesting version of the Scrooge story. Originally done on the CBS SHOWER OF STARS in 1954, a monthly series that alternated with CLIMAX. It has a great cast; March and Rathbone were both major stars from an earlier era who had matured into wonderful character people. Bernard Herrmann did the score, a couple of years before the first Hitchcockfilm. The adaptation is just like all the rest, very faithful to Dickens. It's really great to finally get to relive this thing. I think CBS ran it two times, but I hadn't seen it since '55.Now, somebody needs to find the original live-action version of the musical version,THE STINGIEST MAN IN TOWN, from NBC in '56?. Here, Rathbone is Ebeneezer, and the rest of the cast is really impressive. And the score is really nice. I have the lp. A cd was supposed to appear a few years ago, but it didn't show up. The is an animated version, which sues the title and some of the songs, but it isn't as effective.
0 ||| Tom Clancy puts together a sloppy, unsuspenseful book in which you know the good guys are going to win, the lead charatures take things personal, and the huge plan to destroy the entire human race is going to be foiled.The was no excitement, nothing to keep me reading. Infact it took me over a month just to finish it cause I feel asleep everytime I tried to move a bit farther into this convoluted story.In trying to top the scare/shock/suspense factor of the past several novels in the series, we get to see a company with insanely homicidal tree huggers designing a new version of the same bug that Iran tried to use to stem population growth in the US in the last book, Executive Orders.It's a plot to destroy every one (except the treehuggers of course), and you know that they will fail just because that would end the series.No suspence, no excitement, no reason to ever read it again.
1 ||| I have only one thing to say to Mr. Jordan, move the story along at a faster pace. It is so incredibly frustrating to wait so long for each book to come out, and to then be so disappointed by the last 4 books. Please listen to all your readers and write the story like you did up until "A Crown of Swords", because I for one am fast losing my patience with the plodding pace of the last 4 books and if the next one isn't great I will no longer be reading the Wheel of Time series.
0 ||| Confusing, skimpy, and VERY hard to relate to what you see on your monitor. This gets one star only because that's the least this reviewing system will let me bestow. Dummies books are usually great-but not this thing. Not recommended.
2 ||| The graphics are good. The play is decent.Although it says that there are THREE casinos to "visit", the floor and setup is identical in all three. Seriously idiotic programming. It's not possible to lower the limits on the blackjack tables below $100 min.But mostly: there is this asinine video EVERY time you start up the game. And, if it's not the primary window on your screen, it pauses. Just let the stupid thing run, go make a cup of coffee, it will hopefully be over when you return.I'm not sure this was worth the $12 I paid on eBay for the trio of games. (casino, card, and board.) Surely there must be better casino games available . . .
3 ||| After the dissolution of the Jellyfish I was reluctant to listen to anything Roger or Andy produced. Imperial Drag came and went. I gave it a cursory listen but after the glory of "Spilt Milk" nothing could compare. Flash forward 10 years and I can't get enough of Imperial Drag. Then Roger releases my favorite album of 06 "The Land of Pure Imagination". So naturally when I found out about TV Eyes from his site, I was interested.As has been stated and restated, the album sounds like it was written and recorded in the 80's. You can detect the influences ("Mission: Submission" has a distinct Gary Numan keyboard sound, the bass on "What She Said" sounds as if it were lifted directly from a Tones on Tail recording) yet the album is all original. The songwriting and the performances are solid.Standout tracks include "Over the City", "Fascinating", "Love to Need", and "Fade Away".
2 ||| I dont find it very good because when you put a diaper in it , it opens up and the smell is not covered then....otherwise i have no problems with it... it does not leak smell or anything but while putting a diaper in it it definitely leaks and needs to be improved.
0 ||| When I first saw this movie I knew what I was going to see, but I was excited nonetheless to see comedy and to see what points he makes. I was disappointed. It wasn't funny. It was stupid throw-up, look down on people and other forms of vulgarity humor. It wasn't anything witty. Second, he claims he wants to talk about McDonalds AND individual responsibility. However, the whole film is about corporations, mainly McDonalds and a couple of others. Every once in a while he will say that he values individual choice and responsibility as well. But it is clear the only reason he throws that in is so that he can claim it isn't an anti-corporation, anti-McDonalds film. Rent it, don't buy it.
2 ||| I would agree with most of the reviews already posted. However, one must realize this movie was released in 1999. It is very haunting because the World Trade Center encompasses an entire scene, where Macauley Culkin's character goes up to the viewing platform and looks down on the city. Very, very sad. Makes 9/11 seem so surreal.Also, for young children, this movie can be scary for another reason: they are afraid that they too might be abandonded by their parents. Our youngest son was about five at the time and we had to reassure him that he would never, ever be forgotten or abandoned.For older kids, they see the slapstick comedy of the bad guys and don't realize that this brand of humor can hurt. Our older boy who was about eight at the time went through a few days of pummeling his little brother in one way or another.Other than these issues, it was a typical kid movie that was fun and predictable.
0 ||| This book has a little of everything and not enough of anything. There is a little HTML, but the information is not really helpful. A lot of pages are wasted on screen shots of an installation, but there are no guidelines for setting all the configuration options. More than 100 pages are wasted reprinting Oracles own documentation of the web server packages, but again no value is added. There is even a chapter on tuning SQL, but again not enough information to be usefulEvery time I have faced a question not solved by the documentation, this book has been unable to help.This book is a disappointment!
0 ||| I bought the 525 for Valentine. It worked out of the box, surfed the web with my internet connection but could not use the bluetooth to download songs from my laptop (the FTP service is not enabled, or maybe i didn't know how). Never tried the Infrared.The GPS worked fairly well. I am a new user, so low expectations. But the lady kept telling me to take a left well after the left had gone.None of which matters since the unit just died. It only works if it is plugged in to the wall. I am hoping the store takes a return since I really dont want to gamble $600 that it is just a bad battery.
4 ||| Lucinda sends it straight from the heart with animal magnetism and personal storytelling. No lightweight overproduced fluff here. Some might not have the guts to match Lucinda and hear what she has to say, but her music rocks for anyone who can get into a listening mood and go wiht the music. While you are doing that, listen to what she has to say. From "The way you move is right in time - is right in time with me" to "All I ask - don't tell anybody the secrets, don't tell anybody the secrets I told you" LW gives us a very personal contemporary expression of emotion that anyone who is honest with him or herself can identify with. Pure grit, pure truth, pure art, and just great music.
2 ||| You can read other's opinion on the actual movie. I just want to comment on how terrible the DVD resolution is. It looks as if we're watching a well worn video. Horrible pixalation. No where up to the transfers of A Bugs Life or Tarzan.Ugh.
1 ||| The title says it all. A lousy album. Sheryl Crow is a poor songwriter and even a worse singer. She has no deph, no originality and her vocal range is bad. The songs on this album are so american ( No offense). A Duet with Don Henley and then bacups by Tom Petty and that god awful Stevie Nicks ( except for the rumors material). Sheryl Crow is just so uninteresting in my humble opnion and so is her music.
0 ||| i am sorry to say that this album really changed my opinion of clay aiken. This album is horrible and if you want to know why there are so many used copys available to buy you'll know after listening to this. I want Ruben Studdard
4 ||| This is one of the best compilation CD's I've seen representing the 80's techno pop genre. There are 3 CD's, each about 70 minutes long. Most of the songs are in their complete 12" extended form. Included are some of the most danced songs from the clubs of the 80's. Songs like: "Blue Monday", "Smalltown Boy", "Relax" brought techno pop to the forefront of dance music. There are a lot of songs that are difficult to find like the seductive, "Outside Looking In", by Dream Sequence and "The Night", by Azul Y Negro. Personal bests of the collection are the songs by: B. Movie, Belouis Some, Cabaret Voltaire, and Spandau Ballet (a beautiful, powerful dance ballad!!) If you enjoyed the music of the early to mid 80's with an emphasis on dance then this this the perfect 3 CD compilation. Also in the collection is the "I Love Disco" available in Volumes 1,2, and 3. Each volume contains 3 CD's each.
0 ||| This DVD-production [is bad]! The movie itself is a real good one with beautifully acting performances. Although the dvd-edition do not cost a fortune, it's more like a lousy super-8 after running threw the projector one million times! I'm truly disappointed. The movie is worth much better treatment.
1 ||| As this was recommended along with Barbara Hambly's latest, I decided to give "Dead March" a go. Unfortunately, it can't help but suffer in comparison with "Wet Grave." Several things in the book struck me as being underdeveloped, and I think the main fault was the characterization. Too much information about the characters is given in expository chunks; rather than letting us discover who these people are through their actions and their conversation, we're simply told what their attitudes and personalities are. The story would have been much more effective if they'd been allowed to reveal themselves. The premise itself is fascinating and seldom-seen, but the presentation of the author's ideas would have benefitted from some more subtlety.
0 ||| Lomborg is not an expert . . . he is not even a scientist. His work is filled with errors and displays a general ignorance on ecological theories and processes. Readers would be better advised to turn to peer-reviewed journals (i.e., Nature or Science) for their information, or an Environmental Science textbook for an overview.One thing of note - it is important to be critical of scientific information. Every good scientist is. But there is a difference between critical thinking and lack of understanding. Lomborg does not provide a critical review of scientific literature.Have we made great strides in improving the state of the world? Of course. Without a doubt. But we have not won that war yet - we still have many more improvements to make.--ER Lawrence, Ecologist
4 ||| Lovers Rock has definitely been worth the wait. The entirealbum is fantastic. Saw her in concert on monday, absolutelysuperb.
0 ||| I just watched this movie. This movie is bad! Don't even rent or buy it! This is part of the series "Left Behind" It goes around the same subject about the end of the world. This movie does not show anything new.I do not want to bore you with details about this movie. Do not waste your time watching this movie! It is so bad!!!
3 ||| This novel contains all that you would expect from a police novel. A few twist and turns that keeps you guessing, a good bit of excitement and disappointment. All in all a good Novel.
1 ||| Where was clooney's super hero cape. He was the man with all the right moves every single time. Did he get scratched ?Obviously he was going to hook up with Lopez.No tension or suspense.
0 ||| I received this one as a gift. When you try to open the tray, it opens and closes very quickly. You have to grab the tray and hold it to remove/insert a DVD/CD. It lasted about 2 years, then it only made a noise when I pushed the eject button. Time for a new DVD player. The picture and sound were fine, but this one never worked right, and didn't last very long.
4 ||| I recieved my book packed in great shape and in record time. I am very pleased and would buy from Bev again!! (~:
1 ||| The main character inspires nothing but a mild distaste and unfortunately overshadows with her pointless little musings a much more interesting subject of a people on the verge of revolt. Chloe could have been written as a much more compelling sympathetic narrator through which to see a turning point in a life of a country. There is not enough wit or drama or lirerary cleverness to make one want to read beyond page 15, the only reason I did, is that I made it a rule to finish all books I start. Johnson has written much better books.
1 ||| I have to agree with the above review. As an early fan of Sarah Brightman, I have almost every one of these songs already on previous CD's; the same recordings and everything. While she truly has a beautiful voice, I just don't think it's very fair to her earlier fans when they want something new and fresh to listen to. Everything on this CD is recycled; I could have made it at home on my own computer! There are no new tracks and nothing very enticing about this CD to make me buy it. If Sarah decides to start recording some new songs instead of continuously marketing her old stuff, I might, just might, buy it then. But only until then.
1 ||| As I read this story, and the author accused more and more people of sexually abusing her, I had a really hard time believing what she said. Most accounts of Beth Short have been very specific on one point; she was sexually immature, her genitals weren't fully developed. Now, because of this woman's book, we are supposed to believe that, not only was the Black Dahlia a promiscous whore, but that her father was also Beth Short's baby's father? There was no evidence mentioned in the autopsy report of her having recently been pregnant. I find Janice Knowlton's book very graphic, and maybe she did see her father murder someone, but she hasn't proved to me that the person he murdered was Beth Short.
0 ||| I don't know what I was thinking. I thought Maxim was more like a "Men's issues/health/style/etc." type magazine. It's soft porn, mostly. The articles are uninteresting and poorly written. In fact, it feels a lot like reading a 15 year old boy's school homework, if he could write with no inhibitions nor worry of getting in trouble for honesty. I would know, I'm a teacher, and this magazine has the sophistication level of just that, a 15 year old boy.
4 ||| Loved reading the original story after years of watching the various Hollywood interpretations. Good read for sitting around the Christmas Tree.
4 ||| This album is everything a fan could want in a live CD! Great song choices, very emotional performance, and the songs get different takes in this live setting which makes the whole disc a treat! Definitely a five star disc if you are already a fan of Damien Rice!
2 ||| halloween 30th anniversary box set I was slightly dissappointed in. Because I thought I was getting all of the movies and it was missing 2&3. It gives you a blue ray verson of the 1st one. So you end up with two versons of the 1st one.
3 ||| Rear Window is somewhat languidly paced, lacking the taut direction of some of Hitchcock's best films (Notorious, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, etc.), and this one-set movie does start to feel claustrophobic. I was hoping for Stewart to be able to get out of that wheelchair, leave his small apartment with the oversized lamp shade, and get out into the world.The climax was a bit disappointing. It is chilling to hear Burr coming up the stairs, but once he comes in to the apartment he just starts asking questions -- that's not too scary! And he doesn't even have a weapon on him!It's not one of Hitchcock's best films, but it still is interesting and entertaining.
3 ||| I will first disclose that I am not a science fiction fan, however the guts of this story are far from science fiction. Very foretelling when you remember the time during which this book was written. So interesting that so many readers were horrified at the thought of a world like that and now they are living in that world in many ways!!
2 ||| This alligator is cute and my daughter quite likes it, but as we have wood floors throughout most of our house, he's been banished to the attic. The clatter noise is loud but fine, but my problem is that the wood pieces forming the middle of the body really drag on the wood floor as he's pulled along. If those were a bit shorter so it wouldn't drag on the floor, I'd be much happier with this toy.
0 ||| There are too many technical omissions/errors to make this book readable to me. I get it that a "thriller" is over-the-top, but when I hit errors of this magnitude(flying a Gulfstream onto an aircraft carrier???), my reading comes to a screeching halt. I got about halfway through it, and just couldn't pick it back up. The characters are likable enough, but they're very one-dimensional and predictable. I'd rather re-read GOOD books than try to slog through this. I gave it one star because I had to in order to write a review.
1 ||| I am sorry to say that this feeder was a waste of money. Orioles were attacted to my yard via hummingbird feeders. Unfortunately, the hummingbird feeders attracted bees....lots of bees! I ordered different hummingbird feeder which worked in keeping bees away and keeping hummingbirds visiting feeders. I ordered this oriole feeder in hopes of keeping these beautiful birds coming to my yard and eliminating bee problem. Even though this product has bee guards, bees were attacted to it. It appears when the oriole feed on nector, the nector got on the bee guards thus attracting lots of bees. Had to take it down and unfortunately lost the orioles coming to my yard.
3 ||| I picked up this book not knowing what to expect. It started off slow but once I got into it I couldn't put it down! Its fast moving, exciting, and it makes you think. It amazing that this is the author's first novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who like a mystery/thriller book.
3 ||| "Waiting for the World to end" is a fabulous book that takes place right in my own home-town of Valparaiso Indiana.It brings up many different opinions and touches on a various amount of topics, such as; relationships, divorce, death, abortion,marriage, and alcohol abuse. Nicloe Hunter is the author of this novel, she brings a wide variety of views on the incidents that take place in the story. You'll constantly be guessing what prediciment Tom Olsen, the main character, will be putting himself in next. For example, Tom is an english teacher and basketball coach at Indian River High School.He becomes absolutely infatuated with his best and favorite player's mom.That very situation causes even more inner problems for Tom. To find out what happends next or ride the rollercoaster of events in Tom's life, read this great novel.
4 ||| This collection of essays written by a host of outstanding scholars of ancient philosophy in this generation may well serve as a comprehensive and dense guideline to the philosophy of Plato and the contemporary viewpoints concerning the arguments presented by Plato. I am especially impressed by the excellent introduction written by the editor of this book, Richard Kraut. It is so well-organized, sharply presented and teemed with useful materials that I find it to be the best short introduction on Plato I ever read. And the structure of the whole book is also well balanced that the essays of which it is composed nearly touch every controverisal problems concerning Plato's philosophy and that those problems are all more or less treated in a appreciable way.
1 ||| I have read many articles and books on Jack the Ripper, each proposing a different suspect, but this is the most outrageous.Too many sentences start with phrases like "Just imagine...." or "How about if....." for it to be truly fact-based (as a book like this should be). While the basic theory may be interesting, it is haphazard at best in this book and is not convincing at all. Just because Sickert painted scenes that could be construed as "Ripperish" does not mean he was there. Another poster has stated that artists paint what they are interested in..... This does not necessarily mean they were INVOLVED. While I did find the book to be a good read, I did not find it to be a good work of non-fiction--too much speculation and too many "What ifs" for that.
1 ||| Add me to the list that received a defective machine. I really like the style and the features of this machine. However, after a couple of loaves didn't turn out well, I finally realized that the pan just wasn't hot when I pulled it out of the machine. Amazon made it very easy to return, but I decided to buy a machine locally instead of ordering online again. I bought the Cuisinart CBK-200 2-Pound Convection Automatic Bread Maker. My first one burned the loaves, so it went back to the store. My second one has been working well for a couple of months now. I wish quality control was better for appliances like these.
2 ||| Awesome possibilities that reach you each time you read this book....and you will read it many many many times for there are so many layers, realizations and understandings.
4 ||| This was a very good book to read. I have suggested it to many people that I talk to. All 50 proofs are easy to understand. Why are we letting "scientists" rule our generation and the ones to come?
3 ||| This is not the remastered job that network media did in europe. BUt those masters are being used on the blu ray version of this item. This set features alot of dirt and scratches that the other europeon sets don't have. The br is fine too. The shows first season was it's highlight. It's sci fi that interesting but very fantasy orientated actually. The second season is even more fantasy orientated. The first though has some episodes that are solid sci fi and among the best ever put on film. So it is a mix but the whole thing is fun. And ignore ANY IDIOT who talks about special effects. they were fine back then.
0 ||| I'm not talking about the contents, because I just bought the book and I started reading it now.For my surprise in the first 3 days using the book the pages started to fell over, and I already loose pages from the contents and chapter one.I wonder if there will any left by the time I finish the book.
1 ||| This book shows good ideas and that is why it gets two stars instead of one. I put the analysis into my Fritz Computer Program and found one to two major mistakes in the analysis on almost every page - not just small mistakes, but big ones.I know you might argue that when this book was written computers couldn't be used to check how good the analysis is, but there are books out there with good analysis written before high powered computers could show just how bad some books are.
2 ||| Does not whistle. Have placed a pot watcher inside, because that is the only way one would know the kettle has come to a full boil. Have owned it, and lightly used it for a few days. The real test will be this winter, when we drink much more tea.
4 ||| These sweatpants are very nice. I like the open bottom, as opposed to the gathered leg openings of many sweatpants. These are much more modern-looking.
0 ||| I love the johnny english movies, so when I saw that rowan atkinson was the main character in this movie and I saw all the good reviews, I got it... and was so disappointed. it was just WEIRD. I did not like it at all. I thought it might be funny.I was so totally wrong. I really DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone.
1 ||| Jack Nicholson is a staple of today's 'pop' culture. Today we see him at the Oscar's, being interviewed; like he has always been present. THE WILD RIDE is a step back BEFORE "EASY RIDER", the television westerns. I get the impression that his part in this film took very little effort to get into character. Car/hot rod buffs will enjoy what 1960's movie directors thought were the 'hot set-ups of the day. I would recommend this as an addition to round out your Nicholson collection, a early step in his development.
0 ||| There are other deram books that are much better than this one. This book has alot of negative things to say about every dream listed. This it a book of hogwash and garbage! Research other dream books on the web before you buy them.
1 ||| Not bad work from Arnold & VanDamme. Follows the usual predictable martial arts movie plot (really, we wouldn't expect anything less!). I am however fascinated that reviewers, et al still write about the events on this movie being based upon the "real life" experiences of Frank Dux. Dux has long been discredited as a liar and fake, both as a martial artist (Dux was never in a "kumite" competition), and as a military "hero" (never in the CIA, and was only in the Marines for 6 mos., & never left the U.S. during the Vietnam era), see LA Times Valley edition, May 1, 1988 article "Ninja: Hero or Master Fake?" by John Johnson. Of course, none of this detracts from VanDamme's attempts at acting. If you want plot, you'll be disappointed. But if you like correography--then buy this movie and get ready to use the fast forward button!
0 ||| With all respect to Sir Roger Moore, wich i feel a profund admiration, i have to say that this film was not what i was expecting.Like a mother who always find nice everything that her childs could do.
2 ||| You will find this book very helpful if you are new to Active Server Pages. The book describes very clearly what ASP is, how it works, what it does, etc. This book will also make the beginner comfortable with how to write basic VBscript or similar in order to code their Active Server Pages. Wonderful coverage is given to all the basic ASP objects, their properties, and methods and how to invoke the power of each. This book has some funny prose to it and is not overly in-depth, but it will make a newcomer comfortable with integrating their current html skills, client-side scripting skills, and ASP into useful applications.
2 ||| Whereas purists might cry foul at re-recordings, I have enjoyed this collection for years. Some of the tracks are the original versions. In fact, I don't think anything really sounds inferior. And frankly, 22 tracks from such a talented voice at a bargain price makes for a good value. Plus, there are a few rare gems here, such as the haunting Jimmy Webb-penned tune "Song for my Brother."
2 ||| The book have techniques that I already knew but can be helpful if you are trying to learn
3 ||| It's a great product. Be sure to properly level so the den is completely flush against glass to ensure no tails or toes can get between it and the glass.I bought the medium thinking it would be great for my single Leo. It is a little smaller than I had hoped for.After researching it it seems like the size difference between medium and large are significant. The top level in the medium is pointless for a Leo. I'm returning this to upgrade to the large as I have large tank anyways.I recommend that all new reviews post the size den they buy and the application, as all the reviews for all sizes are in one place. It can be confusing as a buyer to know what size to buy, even with reviews.
2 ||| I read this after reading "Mysterious Island" just to get the background story. I think that Verne must have been a botanist and/or marine biologist - he goes into SO much detail on fauna and aquatic wildlife. This distracted from the story for me, I often found myself skipping pages just to get back to the journey.
0 ||| I am speechless. I usually consider myself to have an open mind but this pushes the limit of incredulity even for me. To publish electronic circuit diagrams and in the first operating instruction is (and I paraphrase) "perform the salt cleansing and ask Jesus Christ to bless the apparatus and allow you to travel through time", which is more important? That you get the electronics right, or the prayer?Leave your money in your bank account
2 ||| The other reviewers have praised Erasmus, and, well, duh. Anyone still in print after 500 years probably had some profound and interesting things to say.But I suspect most people looking at this edition will be doing so in the hope it will contain the variety of secondary materials commonly found in the usually excellent Norton Critical Editions. In that respect I was disappointed with this volume. It does an excellent job of selecting from Erasmus's works, but a poor one, in my opinion, of including secondary literature.I like what is there, I just want more.
1 ||| This is a cute watch, and the shooting frisbee feature is good for a few minutes of fun. The watch never told the right time and the shooter bent and broke after a few uses. For the money, it wasnt a horrible purchase, but of course it was a disappointment to the kids when we kept having to re-set the time. Our 4 year old is just getting interested in telling time and kept proudly announcing "It's 4:30!" just to have us constantly telling him that his watch was incorrect and needed to be re-set! Having said that, it was cheaper than going to a movie and the fun lasted just slightly longer.
1 ||| To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was expecting a little more in-depth discussion/. To me this seemed more like an infomercial. It does have some good information just not what I was expecting
4 ||| These are my favorite style. It is so fun to explain this game to people. The cards suck them in. The game keeps them!
1 ||| I bought this recently, and always had problems keeping the batteries in. I had to hold the cap on the whole time for it not to turn off. The sensor also lasted much less than 500 tests. I have had the monitor about 6 months and used it less than 100 times, and now it wonk work until I replace the sensor. It was a lot of money for poor quality, but it did seem to measure alcohol level consistently
0 ||| This book is horrible. The backstory of the characters is vague at best for over half of the book. Because their was no insight into Rowena and Wulf's background - where their ideas and feelings are coming from - it was impossible for me to get emotionally involved with these people and their relationship. And if you can't become emotionally involved with the characters, then what's the point of writing the book in the first place.Terrible read! This book is headed for the trash can. I wish it was possible to give negative stars
0 ||| I got this book from the library on the recommendation of a friend. While the premise of the story was somewhat interesting, the story itself was lacking. In fact, it was so unchallenging and uninteresting that I flipped through it, missing pages at a time, and I finished the book in 15 minutes. As the mother of an active 2 year old, who stays at home, reading is the only thing that stimulates my intellect. Therefore, I can't afford to waste time on a lousy book. Needless to say, I was glad this book only comsumed 15 minutes of my time. If you want a good book, read " Sister of My Heart". It is intelligent, well written, and thought provoking. Look it up and enjoy a truly good story.
4 ||| VEry informative!!! It reads well, easy to understand book about the realities of the craft. And a very positive one, at that! I have read through the book a few times, and know that i will read it again.
0 ||| At first I liked this product and felt the measurements were accurate. After a week and three uses the monitor just displayed error messages. No matter what I did and who I used it on it would read "error". For this reason I would probably not recommend it.
0 ||| Well, I bought it and returned it when I found out that they had edited the first half of the concert. I had the original taped from MTV back in 92 and lost it but then I purchased the VHS which to my disappointment had Bob Geldof & Spinal Tap removed among other things. Which is still not as bad as this DVD - Somebody please release the whole thing!! Thank You
0 ||| Ripper Owens JUGULATOR Sucked. It was so generic and sloppy, nothing like Judas Priest. Consider the fact that I own 27 albums, 12 tapestries and I have retired 30+ JP tshirts, I WAS one of their biggest fan. He might be good live but he will never ever EVER be Rob Halford... NEVER. Can't sing, can't harmonize and CANNOT write like Halford. Sorry but their time is over with out Halford. Priest is dead, face it.
0 ||| The first three items I checked were not in this dictionary. I don't like the way they credit everyone who has a definition for a word. My daughter bought the one just under this one in price and it is a great source of word definitions. This is pretentious and a big disappointment.Jeanne MatthewsSeverna Park, Md., 21146
3 ||| This is a great book! Algebraic concepts are explained in really simple ways that are easy to grasp, even for the most challenged math students! The only reason I gave a 4/5 is because of how small the text it - the pages are huge and the text is tiny on most pages so it can become quite irritating to read.
3 ||| What else can be said, other than it should be required reading reading for all sci fi fans. A classic.
1 ||| I really wanted to like this book and forced myself to finish it, but was very disappointed. I found the diary style distracting, the characters self involved and one dimensional, and the story line extremely silly. Sorry, I see that everyone seems to love these novels, I just don't.
4 ||| 5 stars because once again another bargain.To me this is like music samples on a CD rather than the best of or greatest hits.This CD is clear sounding.this is worth buying.This is perfect for those who wants to sample music.
3 ||| Mike Portnoy is a terrific drummer, songwriter and lyricist ... but he is not a director. The cinematography would have been great if Dream Theater was some silly glam metal band like Poison or Twisted Sister. And the flashback (acting?)scenes were pathetic, at best.So why 4 stars? Because the music was spectacular (duh?), the extra songs were a nice shift fron the concept, especially A Change of Seasons (the best song the band has or will ever make), and the behind the scenes additions were well-done.Next time Mike, try a little moody lighting. It goes better with the moody and emotional music you guys make so brilliantly.
0 ||| The author supports his thesis with weak scientific arguments. I wish I had saved my money and not bought this book.
1 ||| a couple of the jams rock, but most of it is cookie cutter sound lacking depth. if you want a mix between jimmy eat world and a pop boy band with guitars, this is for you. actually it might be for your 15 year old sister.
2 ||| A good workbook for learning Kanji. It shows each character, what it means, and how to draw it. I wish it would have the meaning of each character written in Romagi as well, I found myself adding that myself, but that's not a big deal. My only serious complaint is regarding the last half of the book which is for practicing drawing the characters. There is no suggestion as to how this section should be used. A character or two to copy from on each page would have helped tremendously. As it is there isn't even a single line suggesting how to use the section effectively, just 50 pages of graph paper. You can flip back and fourth between the page in the front displaying the character you want to learn and the back where you try to draw it, but this is extremely awkward. Especially for someone who is left handed such as myself. I ended up practicing each character on the page describing it.
3 ||| this book ought to rank with the best of the kerouac biographies. while the noted ann charters bio (kerouac) isgood and the nicosia bio (memory babe) is one of the best it is this one that really gets into the seamier side of the beats and kerouac. this book by his former editor falls short though because of his constantly grinding his axe on homophobia and anti semitism that aside it is still one of the best
1 ||| Mediocre attempt - does not seem to fulfill authors stated intent or that of the title. Wanders into apologetic ramblings about race and creed, largely without advancing any evidence for his reasoning - only statistically unsupported ideas. Prologue of book instantly made me suspicious of possible scholarly dishonesty and the following chapters did nothing to allieve me of this concern. I finished the book, I feel, about as knowledgeable as I began it - the information may as well not have been read because I cannot consider it as trustworthy, and must discard most of it outright.
2 ||| I GREATLY ADMIRE BOTH OF THESE ARTIST AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER SEEMED LIKE A SPLENDID IDEA! I EXPECTED TO BE PLAYING THIS CD OVER AND OVER, BUT TOO MANY OF THE TRACKS COME ACROSS AS BEING.....WELL, HOAKEY. SORRY TO SAY THIS, BUT I CALLS 'EM AS I SEE'S 'EM. I AM TRULY SORRY.R C HILL
1 ||| We obtain a vinyl disc ELP "Brain salad surgery" production Shout! factory records. The disc has on both sides of the broad transverse stripes. As Grading is similar to the Fair. It happened at the factory packaging. Although the seller advertised it as new. I would like to sent me a new drive, without damage, and even without an envelope.
4 ||| Great holiday movie with a happy theme and a great program for year round as well as the holiday season.
0 ||| The Hamish Macbeth series is fun, although the episodes don't follow M.C. Beaton's novels accurately. The Series 1 and Series 3 DVDs that I ordered seem fine, but the Series 2 DVD set was defective -- the first of the two DVDs wouldn't play on several players I tried. Amazon handled the returned item well, and sent a replacement, but that one had exactly the same defect -- the first DVD wouldn't play! So, I sent that one back too and requested (and received) a refund. I went to BBC America Shop and bought "Hamish Macbeth Series 2" and it worked just fine. So, I had to pay a higher price for the item from the alternate vendor but at least I finally got a DVD set that worked. As far as the stories, they are well-written and well-acted and I recommend them for fun and enjoyable viewing. The characterizations and plots are different than those in M.C. Beaton's books, though.
4 ||| The first time I saw this movie, I was sitting my 4th grade classroom. I'm now 28 and this is still one of my favorite movies. This is a story about a boy (Bastien) who loves to read and finds a book that takes his imagination a bit far -- he finds the book "The Neverending Story," which is about the crumbling of the fantasy land, Fantasia. The princess calls for a great warrior to stop The Nothing, which is destroying their land, Fantasia. Atreju (pronounced a-tray-you) arrives at the castle and accepts his mission. The quest to fight The Nothing proves tedious, but he meets some interesting characters along the way who end up helping him in one way or another (even if he doesn't know it). At the risk of spoiling the movie, I won't go into more details, but this is DEFINITELY a must-watch for anyone who enjoys fantasy.
3 ||| A very welcome addition to the vast Alice Cooper collection, but you can't help feeling an album of this stature deserves a real proper reissue, along the lines of the Billion Dollar Babies deluxe edition.The sound is fine, though not a big leap from the standard release it has to be said. I welcome any upgrade of this classic album from the original band. Booklet is pretty basic, but all original artwork is there.All in all, a good buy, but for Alice collectors only, as i it's not significantly better than the standard release in my opinion.
4 ||| As strongly implied by the subtitle, "How to Live the Full Adventure of Knowing and Doing God's Will," this book is about application. In fact following every few paragraphs there is a section of reflective questions that summarizes the key points and help you to put them into a context for your own life.Blackaby and King describe personal experiences, but subordinate those to the Scripture. Some favorite examples from the Bible are used repeatedly in the various chapters. Model prayers are included at the end of each chapter to assist a person in praying targeted prayers.If a general theme could be drawn out from the book it would be: a relationship to God is more important than any work you do for Him. That's the essence of the book. The authors say as God reveals to you what He is doing, He invites you to join Him in His work. Consequently, listening in prayer is more important that speaking, according to this premise.
4 ||| This reader/writer is the cheapest that I have found online or in stores! You can get it at office max for $19.99 and avoid the shipping. It really does work on many different kinds of cards. I've used it so far for compactflash, sd, and microsd (using the sd adapter of course) and it has been really easy to transfer pictures and music files for my mp3 player! When the computer reads it, it separates it as 4 different drives, one for each slot. It is small and lightweight. Highly recommend it.
4 ||| We bought this set for our daughter when she was 14-months. She loves the cookware so much and she uses every piece of the set. She loves to stir pretend things in the pots, then gives us a taste, to which we must reply "mmmmmm." We've only had the cookware for a few months, but all of the pieces seem to be durable and are withstanding my daughter's constant play.
0 ||| I feel that this lens seems a lot slower then my others. Since this is not a lens that I must use since I have a better lens at the same focal length I rarely use it. I don't recommend it but others might like it.
2 ||| Peter Straub always has some interesting ideas but I don't think he handles them all that well! Others disagree... This novel about a couple of schoolboys who discover the secret of the heir to a lineage of wizardry has good suspense and some haunting moments, but the ending is VERY disappointing. This would actually have been a better novel WITHOUT the magical aspect, which is largely irrelevant! The brutalized-by-WWI explanation is a bit weak too, IMHO.
0 ||| Just terrible! Although her voice has mellowed and is quite beautiful, Ms Te Kanawa has absolutely no instinct or feel for this distinctly American music. She's just lost in her own peculiar Kiwi wonderland. She is not aided but what have to be some of the worst arrangements of this music ever recorded.Her version of "What'll I do" alone earns her a place on the top ten list of abominable recordings of American music.
2 ||| I would normally start this review by saying "These speaker mounts are ..." but unfortunately, I have to write "This speaker mount is ..." because for the advertised price, you only get one mount. I just assumed that because most speakers come in pairs then so would mounts. Every other speaker mount I've bought has come as a pair but that's not the case here and is why I'm only giving this item three stars. That makes buying a pair of these quite pricey but this speaker mount is good quality and holds quite a heavy speaker. I'd probably give it four of five stars if I'd received two for $27 but as it is, I only got one and felt a little bit ripped off to be honest.
3 ||| The story itself is so much better than what the movie provides. Definitely worth the read! just wish i has bought the trilogy for 15 dollars rather than this one for 8 and i know the other two will cost 8 as well
1 ||| i was wanting to buy this cd but im glad i diddnt i burned it from my cousins. After hearing toxicity and chop suey the rest of the songs are horrible. i think that all the procides for this cd is going to terrorsim. WARNING: DONT BUY THIS CD
3 ||| A coffee stain on the spine, but what do I care? It was three dollars, and it was shipped on time
1 ||| The first part of this book kept me reading, when it got to the trial it turned into a big brag fest about the author, who was also the prosecutor. It turned into all about him and what he did, like he was patting himself on the back it wasn't about the victims at the end but all about him.
1 ||| While the Apex DRX-9200 is a better-quality product than its predecessor (which has been discontinued), it still feels low-quality when compared to Panasonic DVD recorders. It also does *not* work with DVD-R or DVD-RW, but only the "plus" format. I think it looks a bit ugly and is a bit on the heavy side.But the main problem is the future of Apex Digital. According to the New York Times (12/28/04), the company owes its Chinese supplier over half a billion dollars in unpaid bills, and its president was arrested by the Chinese police for "[...]." From the recent lack of new products from this company and the horrible customer support it provides to customers, I'll caution anyone about buying an Apex. Yes this is a bargain, but if yours doesn't work a couple months from now, you might not be able to get it fixed. (But then again, this recorder is only $120 after rebate...)
3 ||| Well, I loved the Indiana Jones movies and [guess what!] I love this one as well!The special effects are really good and many of the scenes are hilarious.However, I've only seen this film once, so I'm not sure if it starts to get boring once you've seen it a few more times.
0 ||| I bought this DVD after a great writeup in the Sydney Morning Herald of this wonderful lady who still plays the piano and puts on lipstick every day even though she is in her 80's or 90's. However the DVD didn't bring out all her personal details and was quite expensive for what it was.
2 ||| It is sad to see the electronic version cost more than paper. It just doesn't seem right. Decent writer, clever marketing.
2 ||| This movie has a lot of charm, but sometimes it's a little boring.Snow White is cute and all. And she has an alright personality. But I feel this movie lacks some of the perfection that other titles such asPeter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition),The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)andThe Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)had.The animals add a lot to the overall innocent feel to the movie. And like I said, Snow White has the perfect, girl-next-door personality.I'm sure I was watching the restored version, but from what I did see, the movie has aged really well considering it was from 1937. That was 72+ years ago!I really enjoyed watching them all dance with Snow White. It was cute.All in all, a good movie for kids and some adults to enjoy. Grumpy's comments and Dopey's actions were the funniest.3.75 stars or a 7.5/10.
3 ||| Michael Stuart-Ware is drummer on two of Love's albums and here shares his insights on the rock group in a coverage of the band's recording and performing career. Love's frontman Arthur Lee has enjoyed much limelight but the group was far more than just his backup group: there were many incarnations and powerful musicians in the band, which Stuart-Ware explores in chapters packed with 'you are there' first-person experiences. LOVE: BEHIND THE SCENES ON THE PEGESUS CAROUSEL WITH THE LEGENDARY ROCK GROUP LOVE is a lively survey of a long-lasting, popular rock group which has played for decades.
1 ||| Not nearly as good as "Here Comes the Brides" - the first CD. This one sound old and tired. I would only recommend this is you are a fan of the band or Nikki Sixx and have already bought the first Bride's album.
2 ||| Sure, just another book that on one hand tells us that only a small minority of Quaker 'fanatics' were abolitionists, and that the war was over expansion and not slavery, and then the next minute have us all believe that Union troops faught and died to end slavery when in many of their hometowns there were laws that forbid blacks, Indians, and mulatooes from staying in town after sundown. If you believe that people died for this, then you need to be reading bedtime stories. The war was fought over MONEY, POWER, and caused by disagreement between Constitutional Federalists and Jeffersonians. Even the Supreme Court ruled that secession was allowed under the Constitution (in 1862 I believe), but in their ruling said basically that 'this is our ruling, but to no avail, because the issue is being decided on the battlefields as we speak'.
4 ||| It is a book that will give their respects to the children who lived in such unbearable, inhumane, and thriving conditions that modern-day child could never exceed
3 ||| Along with Simple Men and Surviving Desire, the Unbelievable Truth is one of Hartley's best films. Firmly entrenched in the 80s when it was made, this lightweight comic romance has a lead character of the wonderful Adrienne Shelley (RIP) as a young woman who negotiates college versus work deals with her parents while believing the world is going to end via nuclear disaster at any moment. Into this comes the hero, Robert Burke in his gorgeous youth, as a newly released prisoner coming back to his hometown. The script is brainy banter and just walks the fine line between stage and actual people, which is one of Hartley's best talents. The earlier films like this one (pre Amateur, for instance) still have a light touch with the dark edge instead of the dark edge with blacker humor like the later films: for fun, romantic, cynical college-educated Hal Hartley, watch this.
1 ||| i was tutoring a high school freshman this past summer in reading "lord of the flies." i wanted to find a video that would be a good visual to enhance his comprehension. after viewing this 1990 version, i almost returned it. this movie is so far off the actual plot. the kids are shown to be caring for a wounded adult at the beginning of the movie; there are NO adults on the island in the book. so the plot is a bit distorted for this version. plus there is alot of unnecessary bad language used throughout the movie. i ended up keeping it for myself, and ordered my student the 1960 version, which is 99% accurate and a much better depiction of what the book entails.
1 ||| I don't see how they can recommend this kit for all DX cameras. The DX7590 would barely fit in that case.
2 ||| Yeah, it's an OK film, but there's nothing new in it at all. Willis plays the role of a gritty, tough cop who wins out in the end. Die Hard? I just felt as though I was watching a movie that I'd seen before, and that we the first time I saw it. Brucie is getting a bit long in the tooth for all this too. He threw off his role as a perpetual 13 year old to become a manic depressive - well, at least, that's thae way he looks in all his recent movies. The smile has gone! Easy watching but not worth buying. Wish I hadn't!
0 ||| I ordered two of the Panasonic PV-C1353W 13" TV/VCR units, one as a replacement for the other.The first had an approximately 1"x5" blotch near the left center of the screen wherethe picture seemed to be faded out (lighter than the surrounding pixels).This was very apparent in the blue setup screens and when viewing fleshtones.Amazon rushed another to me within two days, but the second has the exact same defect and I am returning it today.I don't know if this is a basic defect in the model or if Amazon got hold of two or more bad ones.At any rate I am going to look for a different brand with the same features.
2 ||| I finally got around to reading this classic work last year and was quite disappointed. I tend to limit my reading these days to two primary realms, classic literature and early 20th Century fiction, and this one just didn't measure up to the standard set by other famous authors of Hawthorne's day.It's a simple story about scandal and I guess I was expecting so much more. I wish I could say it was superbly-written but I think that it reflects a lack of committed effort on Hawthorne's part.
3 ||| The Giver is entertaining. It makes you think about moral and philosophical questions. However I feel that many of the characters' personalities were not explored enough. The ending also left too many loose ends and did not give enough closure.
4 ||| These books are great! These books keep you wanting to read them all over again. But, to really understand these books you really need to read the Christy Miller Series, then the Sierra Jensen Series, then read the Christy and Todd Collage Series,and THEN finally read the Glenbrooke Series. If you only read the Christy Miller Series, you won't know as much info on Christy, that relates to these other series. These books are great! You'll keep wanting to read them over and over again. ROBIN JONES GUNN YOU are the BEST writer in the WORLD! I LOVE YOUR BOOKS!-Kyley(Kimberly's daughter)
0 ||| I have no doubt that Basil Pennington is a very loving and well-meaning man,and an expert on his subject. But he is also very maddening.If you want to know about the background to centering prayer then probably this is as good an introduction to that aspect of the subject as any. But if , like me, you actually want to know how to do centering prayer, then don't bother with this book. It tells you just about everything you could wish to know about the history, benifits, and application of centering prayer (it even tells you how to structure centering prayer retreats and seminars). But unbelievably, within its 254 pages Pennington devotes little more than one page on how to actually do it, and what he does say is vague and interspersed with latin phrases. I have the impression that Pennington has written something more explicit somewhere, but this book is definitely not it.
3 ||| I bought a new fish and needed to quarantine him for a bit so I could monitor him for disease. This tank was super cheap and I like that there's a little thing for changing water in the bottom. That said, having two bettas in this tank is ridiculous. Even having one in here permanently would be cruel. My fish is only going to live in this tank, with careful monitoring, for two weeks tops before he goes into a bigger tank with some other fish. This is just way too small even for a betta. As many others have pointed out, yes they can survive. You could survive in a closet too if someone fed you and removed waste. Would you be happy?
1 ||| I bought this game from Amazon Warehousedeals, As part of Amazon good service i thought i will receive a good package. However, once i opened the package everything (manual, receipt, case) was there EXCEPT the GAME...OMG, returning it and placing a new order, hopefully this time it will come complete.
1 ||| Except for a few spare moments in the book, this was one of the worst fantasybooks I ever read. No plot, stupid characters and an even dumber main character. How many Rules are there? I hope it will end soon.
4 ||| Great investment.Audio Osmosis is great for reviewing what you have been studying. I would not encourage someone to only use this product for mcat prep, rather it is only good if you use this product with other materials. I am in a prep course and I like how this audio product will bring up topics about what I had just studied intensly on paper. Its another way of retaining the information.Plus I wont feel guilty if I take time off studying and go for a road trip while listening to Jordan & Jon. Both of these guys are complete clowns who provide you with helpful MCAT info, tips and confidence.
2 ||| Since writing an earlier review of this unit I had to drive up to Naples, Maine. This town is on the AAA map. This town is known to Microsoft Streets and Trips. This town is not in the Garmin's database. Just up the lake is Harrison, Maine. Again, it is known to AAA and Microsoft but unknown to Garmin. Just west of Naples is a larger town called Bridgton. This is in the Garmin database but at the wrong location. The 2620 tries to navigate you to some guy's private house about 2 miles around a lake from the actual town.I spent a fair amount of time with the Magellan hard-drive GPS units and never noticed these kinds of holes and errors in the database.
3 ||| Our entire family really liked this video. Our three kids are all in elementary school now and have outgrown the so called "Big Plane, Big Construction" type videos. If you've seen them, you know the ones I mean ... HELP ! This video shows more than just things. It showed my kids a real adult with a real job. The pilot they used was wonderful and my kids and their friends are still memorizing every word that weird Bob the host guy says. I can't watch it anymore, but my three kids are still giving this tape countless runs for the money. Good stuff !
2 ||| Good filter with an exact fit, but all the outside odors get inside with no dilution at all. If there's charcoal in these filters it doesn't work.
3 ||| Not bad...not bad at all...beats all the foul language that these kids are putting out these days...Four stars!!
1 ||| A fairly good cast in an kinda okay movie. Some good scattered moments. Near the end when the cop say, "They let him out," and Christina says she's going home...Shut off the movie. One of those tacked on, maybe they'll be a sequel endings that wasn't needed.
2 ||| the one i got was:5% purple--45% yellow---45% pink5% green and the top of bulb is clear8-blue triangles-7 little 1 ,big7-yellow12-pink5-green (small)so mostly yellow and pink with about 4 inches of purple on 2 sides of lamp shade.im gonna buy another to see if its better !
0 ||| The product Putco 402404 Chrome Hinge Cover. The purchased product does not have the word "CHEROKEE", as well as is shown in the photo published. This completely smooth without the word. I do not agree with that product.
1 ||| I enjoyed the original Universal Soldier, but like most sequels, this one has much to be desired. I'm a big wrestling fan, so it was fun to watch Goldberg attempt to act out of the ring. He's about as talented actor as Van Damme himself (heh). The movie has a lot of action, so it gets some high points there, but the story line really isn't that good. It's an entertaining movie, but the original is far superior.
3 ||| I truly enjoyed this book, but would have loved a more substantial ending. Anna's Frith, the book's main character, was amazing. She was the backbone of a very desperate society. Ms. Brooks language transported me to another time and I felt as if I were really in the village, suffering right along with my neightbors. Her descriptions were stunning, her prose beautiful. It is highly unusual for a book to stir a desire to "learn more" through research, but this book did just that. It was truly a difficult time, compounded by ignorance. "Year of Wonders" is a heartfelt work, right up until the last chapter. Was it the publishers idea to stretch the book out? The ending did not flow with the rest of the book and left me wondering what happened to Anna. Bad ending and all, I would still recommend this book.
2 ||| This is an excellent debut for a band that plays the pub and bar circuit in southeast England. Completely self financed and produced, it contains some superb pieces and masterful musicianship. From the opening seagull motif through an elaborate tapestry of a musical voyage it never fails to deliver a level of maturity and emotion.The album though has a major defect which only allows it to have 3 out of 5. The production quality is quite poor. This can be accounted for because it was a self financed CD, but it does diminsh what could have been one of the finest debut albums of the British underground progressive rock scene.
2 ||| I was disappointed to find that this book was advertised as new but is not new. The name of a previous owner is written on the flyleaf and the edges of the pages are yellowed. Since the book was for myself, I kept it and read it. I would have returned it if I had bought it as a gift. Buyer beware!
0 ||| This one gift I could give my grown daughter. I read this book over and over to her as a child. It was in wonderful condition!
4 ||| This ring was perfect for what I wanted - size was correct. Although a bit bright when it arrived, with wear it looks more and more like the real thing! Can't beat the price.
0 ||| I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. He claimed he had over 20 ferrets and at one time had a flea problem. I vacuumed, sent the dog to the groomers for a flea dip, then came home and sprayed the entire house. I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief. Forget the claim that it keeps on acting for up to 7 mos. I am not infested with fleas, but we still have them.....and they are alive and well.
2 ||| Everything was OK except for one flaw which I consider rather glaring. It does not restart where you left off if you turn it off in the middle of a movie. You better make sure to write down the chapter and scene or you'll have to do some hunting to get back to where you left off. Hopefully, Samsung will come out with a firmware upgrade to address this issue. The only other minor issue is the amount of noise the heads make when a disc is first inserted. It's a lot noisier then my old DVD player but once the movie gets going it quiets down.
4 ||| I have seen (properly, in a movie theater) both the Japanese version and the American version that includes Raymond Burr.The Japanese version is "fair" but harder to follow. The American version includes Raymond Burr with superior editing.
3 ||| This products works. I have tried others, and don't get me wrong the others have worked. But Oxypowder has achieved better results. I normally take two capsules before going to bed. The next morning your body is ready. I definitely think it is worth the hefty price.
0 ||| This is my second watchwinder. First lasted 2 months, this one 7 months.(Forget about getting your money back). Very good while it worked.Seems to be same as Techswiss model. I wonder why its so difficult tomake a reliable one. its not exactly high tech technology. Ripoff I suppose.
3 ||| Briefly, if you're looking to learn the basics of sound-reinforcement - buy it; if you already know the basics but want to fill in some gaps; buy it.Great book.
1 ||| I was most disappointed with the quality of this DVD - it seems nothing more than a poor copy from an even poorer Video which is such a shame as I had eagerly awaited the transfer to DVD. The film is excellent but spoied by the poor quality of the DVD
2 ||| Okay, perhaps this may seem a bit anal, but since thinline is in the title I feel as if I should say that it is NOT less than 1 inch thick (despite what it says in the description). Even while pressing this Bible firmly down on the table it measures 1 3/16 inches thick. If, like me, you bought this because you really liked the size of a previous thinline Bible you might be a bit disappointed. Also, I have a few other trutone covered books that I like much better (the Greek and Hebrew Reader's Bibles). Those are softer to the touch and a bit more grippy than this cover which has a pebbled finished. Additionally, I did not realize that this has no cross-references (although the description doesn't say it does).On the plus side this Bible does have a few extras that are helpful such as generous map section, and pictures of Jerusalem (Old and New, ect), the temple, tabernacle, etc. And of course, the ESV is a pretty solid translation.
3 ||| I have read numerous reviews and my feelings are both "with you" and "against you", but in the final analysis.... #1. You have to keep in mind that this is fiction, not the real world.....that is why all of us are Clancy fans. #2. Yes, it was kind of long and probably could have been condensed somewhat, but Mr.Clancy's claim to fame is refining his very intriguing characters to the best of his abilities.....and I would doubt anyone who is a true technocrat would say that he has not lived up to his superb abilities. #3. My bottom line.....GREAT----Very lively read and simply let your imagination run wild----as a intellectual excercise---at the starting point of the battle and continuing, draw yourself a map and plot for yourself the actual war stategy for both sides----FUN!
0 ||| I hated this film. This movie is bad, but being a Garfield fan for a long time, I had to give it a try. The story (if you can call it that) is basically a plot for Garfield to rescue Odie who has been dog napped and to get into funny situations. Garfield has some very funny lines (down dumb dog) and gets into some very funny situations and Bill Murray was terrific as the voice with just the right adjustments here and there to be funny. Other than that the story is just enough to hold together the "plot", the human acting is painful (Breckin Meyer & Jennifer Love Hewitt need to fire their agents) and the dialogue is corny. Also I thought they should have made Jon the loser with women that he is in the comic strip and Odie should have been a CGI character as well. Overall its not a masterpiece of film, but if you go in knowing what to expect it is funny at times. This movie is for Garfield fans and parents who want to take their kids to a family film.
3 ||| A different take on grunge than maybe, (if you even know what grunge is), you're accustomed to. I like it.
1 ||| I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now.
1 ||| Compared with the original Tarzan book, this story is disappointing. However, it contains essential information for the following Tarzan books.
2 ||| The DVD player works fine and arrived on time. The only downside to this item is the color seems over saturated even after making adjustments on my television and the player. The second complaint is that the door where the dvd is inserted seems to get stuck a bit. Lastly, you definitely need to use the remote control to operate the player. It has buttons for on/off, play, etc. but, they don't actually work for me. Overall, I believe it is great for the money.
0 ||| This is the worst movie i've seen in a long time. It's a cool idea, but everything about the finshed product just.....well, it sucks. Hard. :sigh: when will Ulli Lommel stop?
3 ||| Hello ,Het is een goed boek maar er kan soms wel wat beter uitgelegd worden de mensen die dit boek kopen kennen er niets of niet veel van en dan is het wel soms niet duidelijk .Maar voor de rest is het een heel goed boek en zeker aan te raden als je met deze super v8's wilt werken .Grtz Steven
3 ||| I thought The History of Mankind was fasinating. I think this is a good book for anyone learning about World History. It is a advanced, but well paced, so an Elementary student, reading carefully could read it as well as a Junior High or High School student.
4 ||| Forget "...& Nico." Yeah, VU's first album was retrospectively groundbreaking, but "The Velvet Underground" was the band at its peak. It has plenty of edge, but with plenty of pop moments, too. After "White Light, White Heat," this may sound like mellowing out. It is. But it's no mellowing out at the expense of great songwriting and almost singable (!) sounds. It isn't perfect: "The Murder Mystery" doesn't hold up to more than one listening, and "After Hours" works OK as an album closer but is otherwise mostly fluff. Beyond that, there is not a weak link on the album. The lead break on "What Goes On" alone is enough to justify owning it.
0 ||| Waste of my time...documentary? Hardly. I think Moore is the fool of the century. I used to respect him as a filmmaker, but now you couldn't pay me to watch anything this person generates given his stretch of truths which I can understand and respect if he wouldn't go and tout his work as factual. Had this been an accurate accounting of events, it would then be classified as a documentary.
0 ||| I have to say this smells like arse! I don't care for products with perfume but this one smells like rotten underwear. Don't waste your money!
2 ||| The first episode and a half weren't that exciting. Kids "fight" in the junior division and it's really not that exciting until the finals: Goten VS Trunks. It's a great fight between the two and definitely worth seeing. The menu is animated and has lots of options.
3 ||| I read this when I was 12. I liked it. I think they should have been honest about what happened, rather than trying to cover it up. That would have saved them from a lot of grief.(I wouldn't advertise to the world that I didn't "get it" if I were 35.)
1 ||| The book in itself was typical Crichton material; well-researched, touches on relevant issues and hard to put down. However, I must say that this book lacks anything new. In my opinion, this book is just Disclosure with a woman in the lead and the airline industry instead of computers. Take note of these similarities;The company is in the midst of a significant event. In Disclosure, we have a merger, here we have a big sale to ChinaThe leading person finds himself/herself in a situation where he/she in in danger of being out of a jobMeredith and Arthur conniving against Sanders while here, we see Marder and Richman conniving against Casey.Again, the monday, tuesday, wednesday thingThe ending's almost the same, the hero finds himself/herself in public spilling out the beans.Well, that's about it. To boot, I already knew the ending. That son thing was topic of a news article around a year ago in an airline company somewhere. It really did happen.
3 ||| This game is hilarious me and my father love it to death. but the people in it are dangerously RETARDED they run in front of cars and they drive into buildings killing themselves. it is a just for laughs game, therefore it is nothing like GTA but it is not a waste of money because it is crazy and funny.LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3 ||| This album is not too edgy nor is it complete schlock. It doesn't hit you over the head with sex and swearing, but it does not go over the top in the smaltz. There are some songs that manage to be edgy and sexy, mainly because they don't try to be. This is pretty much just a fun cd. You can sing these songs in the shower. Touch is a very smooth song. With it's hip hop/latin rhythms, this song should be a hit. Invisible is pretty catchy. When You Say You Love Me will get you going. It's a country pop song that could really go eitiher way. This is the Night is stuck on here. That is not one of the best. If you really want to hear something sexy, put on Run To Me. He sings in his gorgeous and deep lower register. There are plenty of key changes in this one. Listen to that and The Way and Perfect Day. You'll be impressed with the range. Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs have a rockin edge. The songs on this cd could be better. Hopefully, Aiken will further try out hip hop and country.
3 ||| I love the selection of songs- Peel me a Grape! Her voice is wonderful. When she matures she will give the "greats" a run for their money.
4 ||| I just love this cheese slicer. It produces very thin clean cut slices of cheese and is really easy to clean. I do not put it in the dish washer.
1 ||| The movie has no more plot than a cat and mouse sequence that never ends. In the parts where I wished the movie would slow down, it went too fast. In the parts where I wished the movie would speed up, it went too slow.If you're looking for an intellectually stimulating film, steer clear of Master and Commander. It's a cat and mouse chase that lacks creativity. I thought the chase scenes in the Matrix were long, but compared to Master and Commander, Matrix's sequences are short and deep. Master and Commander is only a thriller, there is nothing epic about it.
3 ||| Good book, very fact filled and well researched. The author was very knowledgeable about the subject, however it was a little more detailed than I wanted. It was written at a higher level than I would have liked. I believe the author was aiming for a more academic crowed, and I'm just a dabbler in this subject. I knew nothing about the subject and now I know a whole lot more.However, since I knew nothing to start with, I was very fascinated by the whole idea of the spirit of democracy of the time being manifest in the church of the time. Whether it was good or bad I will not give an opinion and the author did a good job of sticking to the facts and leaving his opinion out of the copy as much as possible.If this area of study interests you, I would recommend the book. If it's only a passing fancy of a possible interesting read, you might want to think twice.
4 ||| Drucker shares so much knowledge about the early to mid 20th century global economic situation. He predicts the coming era of information technology. He suggests our advanced economies must shift to depend on knowledge work rather than industrial might. He explains why barriers to trade must fall in order for the most productive companies/countries to thrive. The Government's role diminishes as multinational corporations grow. Isolationism and protectionism hurt an economy in the long run. There are great concepts explained in this book, but it is like drinking from a fire hose. I needed to go through it twice, and will probably make a third attempt in the next few years.
4 ||| Behind the 19th century english text is mind-boggling exploration through life on various dimensional planes from the perspective of a square that ultimately is liberated from his two- dimensional realm.
0 ||| We watched every episode of the Christy TV Series in a two week span, and were so in love with the series that I rushed out and got the 3 made-for-TV movies to continue the story.We honestly could not even finish watching them. Viewed next to the original series, the "new" ones are painful to watch. Even my 8 year old daughter said the movies were horrible.So sad, because we thought the Christy TV series was one of the best things we had seen recently.
2 ||| I expected this to be a printing of the book, instead, it looks like scaled down photocopies of the original pages which occupy the middle third of the page. It is very odd...
3 ||| Ok, the cover art is silly, but the live double album is a must have. The lilting introduction of La Gaza Ladra transports you into the concert hall and takes you on a journey trhought the highlights of Marillions' Fish years. A truly great retrospective of their years together as one of the all-time great prog-rock bands.
3 ||| I recently bought this toy for our son. He has been cruising for weeks now from one piece of furniture to another. When I opened it he immediately began trotting across the living room. The other problem is not enough floor space. He gets upset when he hits the wall and it doesn't move anymore. Since we've bought this toy he has taken a few steps on his own. I believe it helps little ones learn to walk. I would recommend this toy to anyone.
3 ||| most of you have probably had this album for a while now, and loved it for a little longer than that. it's superb, and groundbreaking, and accessible, and complex, and bizarre, and all the other titillating adjectives you hear people apply to bjork and her music. this, i think, may be her most enjoyable album, very cohesive and sturdy, with nary a weak link to be found. but then again, i haven't listened to all that much bjork in my lifetime. i've found that i take her best in smallish doses.
0 ||| PLEASE...somebody who pretends to have understood the ending, explain it here. Start your review with a disclaimer not to read any further if you don't want to know the ending. Those of us who seriously thought we'd gotten a book with missing pages at the end would like your insight. If you're one of the reviewers (a minority to be sure) who thought the ending "subtle and clever" you should point out what clues the rest of us missed.Until I hear from you, I'll have to conclude that this book had no ending. It was a murder mystery that (at least for me) didn't answer any of the "who" "how" and "why" questions.
2 ||| Hearing that Manowar was coming out with a concept album, I was curious to see how well they could stack up to the King of concept albums, King Diamond. Well, let me just say that NOBODY compares to KD in this catagory.I give this new Manowar 3 stars because I am a hardcore long time fan of their's. I only rank Louder Than Hell below this one. It's a shame we may never hear a return to their pre-Louder Than Hell glory years.But fear not becuase Type O Negative just came out with another good one, NIN will have another one out very soon, and KD in June. Not to mention that Gwar just came out with one a few months ago. What a year!!
2 ||| I have used several German language resources to try to get a handle on this imposing language.I found this book to be less helpful than Harrap's German Pocket Grammar, which I much prefer. Part of my preference is that more material is covered in more depth in Harrap's. One example: prepositions are covered in 3 pages in Essential German Grammar and while Harrap's devotes 21 pages even though Essential describes prepositions as "much more complex in their use than [...] English prepositions.Harrap's also is a nice small size which is easier to carry.
2 ||| I bought this to block my dogs. It's great as long as the wall is perfectly square and there's no baseboard; otherwise, it's kind of hard to get a nice, tight fit while having to hold it up over the baseboard and size it at the same time. It keeps the dogs out, but if they were to try, they could definately knock it right over.
1 ||| Like it or not, NBA Hang Time is basically NBA Jam with a new name. And NBA Jam TE is actually better. Get NBA Jam TE instead.
1 ||| Maybe I was too close to the story and setting of this book (I too was the outsider middle class girl who attended a rich girl school)... but I did not find anything likeable about the protagonist of this story, Lee Fiora, and at the end of the book I felt as if nothing had changed. Is it even possible to leave high school the exact way you enter?As the novel progressed and she moved through her high school years I kept waiting for her to grow up, come into her own, do SOMETHING besides mope through every day as an uninteresting, unenthused brat. I kept trying to relate to her on some level-- to have a reason to like her, have sympathy for her, ANYTHING! But it just never happened.
0 ||| If this wasn't a mandatory read for school, then I wouldn't have read this piece of junk in the first place. The plot was disjointed, jumping around character POV and writing styles. If a better plot was used then maybe the author may have been able to pull this off but in the scope of boring OLD john everyman this book was boring. Understanding without something like sparknotes is also a colossal challenge. When a read is mandatory I expect a well written piece of literature, not some half baked mockery of a book. I don't know why but instead of love, this book gave me intense hatred.
2 ||| This movie was o.k. but I didn't care for it as much as I did Shanghai Noon. In Shanghai Noon I couldn't stop laughing but I didn't find that I laughed but a time or two in Shanghai Knights. The bloopers at the end gave me many more laughs then the actual movie did. I thought the vase scene was way to fake & didn't make a whole lot of sense. I don't plan on watching it again. To be honest, I just saw the movie yesterday & can't remember most of it. It's just not a movie that's going to stick with you. I'd say skip this movie.
3 ||| I have started using this with my toddler and it is very helpful cleaning up the food crumbs he had made. I bought two, one is always in his bag that I use when we eat out and the other at home. We will not go out without it. Easy to clean even with liquids.
3 ||| I've only been doing ASP for about 6 months, and I found this book extremely helpful. There are a few things that I have always had questions about and others that I didn't understand at all. This hit just about all of them, and I feel as if I understand ASP much better now.The only problem was that I was hoping for a little more coverage of .Net than this book contained -- only one Appendix. On the other hand, I haven't been able to find much else at the bookstore yet. So, this is probably about as good as you're going to do.
4 ||| This awesome vintage Level 42 from their early days in there career. You can't find this sound from musicians anymore in my opinion.
3 ||| This book so far I think si one of the best gerbil books I have read so far. The book is filled with detailed color photos and descriptions. The book also contains valuable gerbil care, housing, and other information which can be useful to ownersin times of need. This book is definately a must for every gernil owners out there. :)
4 ||| As a musician, I am impressed with the quality of the performance on this CD, as well as the excellent texts adapted to ancient Celtic melodies. The CD contains a good mix of musical styles. Among my favorite familiar tunes are "O For A Thousand Tongues", "Be Thou My Vision", and "St. Patrick's Breastplate", but there are also songs that are refreshingly new to me. Loved every minute of it and play it often.
2 ||| The transfer leaves quite a bit to be desired. The picture (video) portion is only so-so though at one point I was thinking it might have come from a VHS tape but I am not sure of that or how the transfer to DVD was made. I really think the picture quality could have been better. The sound also left a lot to be desired and there was a background noise from beginning to end which did not help intelligability. I am adding this to my movie library as I enjoy the story , as simple as it is and to compare it to the 1951 version with Debra Paget. I will try this on an upsampling Blu ray player and hopefully get some visual and audio improvement. Considering it is 1932 I am happy to have this edition.
0 ||| You'll be seeing countless copies of this CD (and all of Ms. Krall's other work) in used CD stores across this nation for decades to come.
1 ||| Well in that case you have heard it allAll the song sound exactly the same.When you want to hear some great power\prog metalTry savatageThis album is boring boring boring!!!!!
1 ||| -1. it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoying2.there was a classic batman bad guy3.no batmobile+the plot was good except the 1st half and the special were good could have been a lot better
1 ||| This CD is just whatever. I wasn't really too impressed with it. Ne Yo can carry a tune, but he has no range and all of his songs sound the same. Maybe if there were real instruments being played instead of beat machines and synthesizers I'd be a little more interested. Anyway, this CD was boring and it was hard for me to listen to. Ne-Yo needs to stick to writing songs for other people. Skip this.
1 ||| As Elizabeth I, Cate Blanchett is, of course, extraordinary. As a visual extravaganza, the film is lush and dramatic. And yet, the overall effect is rather wearying. The director uses a pretty heavy hand, especially when it comes to the score. He also manages to make the drama of Elizabeth's early life, which hardly needs any embellishment, seem unlikely. I don't mind loose treatment of factual events if used in service to the story, but this film was loose in tone, so that it was hard to believe that these were Elizabethan men and women, rather than actors in rich costumes. This is filmmaking as music video instead of filmmaking as storytelling.
0 ||| Made in China crap...NOT made in the usa. Typical Gerber lies. Yes I know, got sucked into ordering and Chinese crap showed up...who knows what chemicals it's tainted with. Look someplace else if you want made in the USA and expect a quality product.
0 ||| This book is great if you want to buy unscented soaps and add oils to scent them but no information on truly createing your own formulas.
3 ||| Ah, for our connection to the past. A wonderful read with enough nostalgia to pull you directly into the past.Don't forget to put this book on your must read list. A few difficult passages with reference to race, but thedialogue was true to that period, and the comments the same. My, we have come a long way. However, for a connection to the past thatwill leave you wanting more, have a read of Letters of a Woman Homesteader. You won't be sorry...
0 ||| Avent is not a good product. The bottles do not prevent baby from getting too much air in their tummies. One thing I really hated about these bottles is that they leaked! When I would go to shake up the bottle, I would get formula everywhere. So, I would unscrew the nipple and tighten it again. Same thing. I'm sorry, but I expect bottles not to leak when I pay almost 5 dollars a bottle. This product is a gimmick!
4 ||| Based on other reviews, decided to buy. Easy set up. Works as designed. Perfect spot above my garage door. Have 2 - getting a third.
3 ||| interesting and easy to read. A good first approach of the bollywood film industry. Not enough photos and no colours.
0 ||| Somebody gave me this book for a gift, and I really have to say it's the thought that counts. I've read two other books by David Hagberg, in the hopes that he could get one right just by the law of averages. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed. I can name many other authors who are more than adequate substitutes for him, books that make you think(Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, Stephen Coonts, Len Deighton, John Le Carre, Frederick Forsyth, just to name a few). If you want to read a book about a resurgent Russia, read Icon by Frederick Forsyth. The bestseller lists are a good acid test for the techno-thriller genre. If it doesn't make it there, it's probably not worth reading.
4 ||| I'm listening to this record for the third time as I write this, and it's not going to leave the CD player anytime soon. Immediate favorites on the disc are "Pillars", "Every shining time you arrive", the title song, and one of the last 3 (I don't recall- they're all good). In the words of Jeremy Enigk, "The new album, pardon my french, is gonna kick a__!"- and it does. It's mellower on average than "Diary," and all the new stylistic touches of s/t are used plus even more new stuff. The sonic variance gives them even more depth of expression and makes for a truly enjoyable listen. The lyrics are as great as I expected. I just can't praise it enough. An instant classic.
2 ||| I bought these to use for photography, it will work fine for what I want, and I'll likely purchase at least one more to make sure because of the good price, but the edges of the paper were damaged from how it was packaged. It was shipped in a small box just big enough. I'll update after purchasing the second roll.
2 ||| As others have said, it's not for those with bad knees. The workout involves a lot of jumping and squats.But if that doesn't apply to you, and you're looking for a decent mix of cardio and toning, this is a great buy. I always work up a sweat during the cardio portion. (A couple of the circuits could be a tiny bit more challenging to get your heart rate up higher, so if you're in above-average shape this might not be the video for you.) The 15-minute "blast the fat" toning for legs, arms, and abs is excellent. I esepcially like the abs section. Granted, the moves aren't anything I haven't done before, but she does the right amount of reps to make the stomach burn.Lastly, Minna is a pleasant instructor -- her cues are right on and she keeps you motivated without being annoying.
2 ||| No real indepth information. It does have a lot of different trees listed but don't rely on this to be your only book on the subject.
4 ||| I like this product when using my Bosch combo kit on my router table. This base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included Hex Key. In additon, I can leave this base permanently attached to the router table. I simply pull the motor out of the base that's attached to the router table and then stick it into one of the other router bases when I want to use the router freehand. Very convenient.
0 ||| I felt like the movie kept me entertained in the beginning, when it was all about the zombie-things and all. But there was that totally unnecessary shot of the main actor's nether regions. What was up with that? Anyway, I was mildly entertained through the whole beginning, but then all the sudden, the zombies weren't important anymore. What was important was that the two girls escaped being raped by the army guys. YEAH, RIGHT. We entirely shifted focus, and I found it terribly stupid. And the ending was the stupidest thing I've ever seen. It was a terrible disappointment when I had been wanting to see it for so long.
4 ||| This isn't as good as AFD, Lies, or UY#1 & UY#2, but it's still a great album even if it is a cover album. Hair of the Dog, New Rose, Human Being, and Raw Power are the best tracks. I know it's been said before, but there is a hidden song written by Charles Manson at the end of the album. Just listen a little bit after I Don't Care About You and you will hear it.
0 ||| Quite simply, I was very much looking forward to this movie, but have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life.
3 ||| Even though this cd pales in comparison to TLA's Torch, an earlier release, it still contains numerous exquisite pop tunes. Let The Rain Blow In, Sidewalks And Spaces, and Summer Books are excellent, upbeat numbers with driving bass lines and extremely catchy hooks. Other tracks like Give Me The Colors and Peel Away are somewhat vacuous, not representing TLA's true talent. This band is really awesome though. When they got rid of the old bass player, Tobin Rodriguez, I thought the band would be on the declivity. However, Tony Zanilla, the new bass player, is just as good as Tobin was, and the band's sound is more or less the same. If this is your first encounter with TLA, buy Torch. If you've heard Torch and liked it, then this is a good buy.
1 ||| This book was disiponting with Paul as emporer he was to powerful and he did not do much himself it was more ploys and counter-ploys. With not as much done in the book it was like polotics today, boring and uneventful. The idea of him going blind and still being able to see was kinda of tacky and wierd. Do better on the next one.
2 ||| This is a very informative book, and it is well written. But, the Kindle edition has format problems. The end marks don't link, it is missing chuncks of words on some locations (one page has about 10% of the words are missing) several letters per word are missing so the page reads like having to solve a puzzle. On a different page the text is overwritten by other text. This is not in the part you get as the sample. I don't know how they will let anyone know the issue has been fixed, but I just wanted to apply an FYI.
1 ||| THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT, AND IN A WAY I DID, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT NOT BUY IT.THE SCENERY WAS AMAZING, THE STORY WAS A BIT DOWN. SAW IT ONCE DONT CARE TO SEE IT AGAIN. MY OPINION OF COURSE.
2 ||| I am a huge fan of both the Harry Potter books and the movies. This is a truly fantastic film, and it does live up to the book (although of course they couldn't fit everything in, the book was massive). However, the main reason I'm writing this review is to point out that if you're a Harry Potter fan you'll definitely need to spring for the two disk special edition. This edition has just the movie and that's it, absolutely no special features whatsoever (that's why I gave this only 3 stars, the movie itself is clearly at least 4). If you're looking for those added features, definitely go for the special edition set, this edition includes nothing but the movie.
1 ||| A couple of reasons why I didn't like this project:a) Monique tends to tell the same jokes in all of her routines. These women have been locked up for many years, many are never getting out. I thought that they (and those who support Monique) deserved a better show.b) Too much profanity. She is already a funny lady. Lazy people, however, lean on profanity when creativity is lacking (see above). I know for a fact that she could have done better. She isn't a lazy woman by any means, but it is painfully evident that she wasn't motivated here.What I loved about this project, however, was the interviews she had with some of the inmates, and that rousing encore song by one of the female prisoners at the end. She had everyone crying (including me!). I hope that Monique kept her promise to that young lady long after the cameras stopped rolling. For these reasons alone, I gave two stars.
0 ||| I have been using Quicken for 9yrs now and have found it to be a good solutions for keeping track of finances etc. I've upgraded several times over 9yrs and had problems a few times but generally it has worked fine. I just received a notice in the mail indicating that Quicken 2004 will no longer be supported by April of 2007. Given the number of legitimate bugs in the 07 release this company has some nerve driving customers to upgrade from versions as new as 04. Given the amount of time and pain it could take to make the conversion and hours spent on the phone dealing with some tech support guy that speaks broken english in India I think this company is going to cut its throat. It's pretty clear based on all the feeback that they have big issues with the initial release of 07 and are forcing good customers to make the leap. I'm going to upgrade to 06 and see how that goes
3 ||| The orioles love this feeder and my hummers pretty much leave it alone. It keeps wasps and flies out. The only drawback is it leaks in the wind. I like it overall!

1 ||| My daughter hates the Avent nipple, she is breastfed and can't seem to suck on these nipples, even though she does fine with regular nipples. I find that ironic since they market these as easy to transition from breast to bottle. The wide neck makes it harder for me to keep air out of the nipple. These bottles are large and they don't fit any other nipples or rings. They don't fit well in my dishwasher baskets either. They are just plain cumbersome, and overpriced.

4 ||| my first christian concert. it was so uplifting. i could not stop listening to them. step up to the microphone is my favorite. i want to share your music with so many people. and i do! my girlfriend and i took our 14 year old daughters and they jumped the whole time. it was my daughters very first concert. you left quite a lasting impression with us. stay the way you are and don't ever let it go to your head because that would just ruin it. we all need your kind. God's blessings to all of you and i hope to see you again.
4 ||| The Kensington Expert Optical Trackball has virtually become the standard by which others are measured by. Because of the price, most users hope that less expensive trackballs will suffice, but quality comes at a price. Fortunately Kengsington has hit the mark with excellent design and functionality. My experience with Kensington was a total pleasure. The unit is exceptional, but I accidently broke the wrist rest and wrote to Kensington for a price on a replacement part. I received a very prompt and thorough response and they sent an entirely new trackball with wrist rest free of charge. That's called perfect product service, and I just wanted to share this side of product satisfaction with everyone.
0 ||| Stay away from this album. The band is in a constant state of flux, the lead singer DJ's on the weekends at some low level bar in Newark. The band members leave on a regular basis. Save your money and download the free music off the net.
1 ||| My Sony 520's have the shakes too. I've had four of them in my lab and they're terrible. Text and vertical lines appear to squirm, it is extremely unpleasant. I tried everything to cure the problem, I made sure there were no other electronics near the monitors, downloaded the latest drivers, ran on UPS, moved to another building, nothing worked.I managed to return two of them before and Sony is working on a pro-rated buyback for me, so that's good. I don't understand how these monitors can have this problem!!! They're all used on brand new computers with four different video cards (the better the card, the worse the problem!). Including GeForce4Ti4600, GeForce4Ti4200 and Radeon9500pro.I'm going to go to LCD's from now on, or another brand if I want the big screen for much lower price (20" LCD's are still cost prohibative).
4 ||| One of the best, if not THE BEST album, from Siouxsie and the Banshees. My favorites are:The RaptureO' BabyThe Lonely OneFall From GraceStargazerNot ForgottenI would recommend this album to brand new listeners who might be considering Siouxsie and The Banshees for the first time. It's a great starters album. I just can't get over how "anthemic" and amazing "The Rapture" is!Worth every penny!
4 ||| I read this book over 40 years ago and wanted to refresh my memory. Although it is erotic it also is a depiction of life in the 19th and early 20th centuries in England and the U.S. The author was obviously a well educated person and a bit boastful but the descriptions of life are most vivid. I saw a movie of part of the book and it starred Jack Lemmon playing the part of Frank Harris. I loved the story!!
2 ||| This translation has some problems. It is a bit bland compared to the King James. The translators are known more for their work with Modern Hebrew poetry and their style doesn't really fit here. On the other hand, the commentary, while not without flaw, is consistently enlightening, as is the essay at the end by Robert Alter.
3 ||| We got this item for our 9 month old son. He absolutely loves the ball pit; however, you will want more than 50 balls. The whole family can have fun, even our dog loves to race through the tunnels.
4 ||| This is an excellent recording, obviously mastered by some masterful recording engineers. My only wish is that I could've been in the recording studio or dance hall myself, but this is about the next best thing. Duke Ellington I adore and will forever, but this selection puts jazz band music in a whole different perspective. Smoke is coming out of my speakers. The whole house is shaking. The roof is buckling. Don't say you weren't warned!
3 ||| Roots was a book about a couple Omoro and Binta who have a baby boy named Kunta. However, Kunta is kidnapped by whites and he becomes a slave. His master is very nice to him by not using the whip on him and he gives him the name Toby when he arrives. Later on he marrys Bell a cook and they have a daughter named Kizzy. However, Kizzy is put in jail for writing a fake pass for her loved one.My grandfather thought I should read this book, because he thought I would like it. When I first looked at it I didn't think I could read all of it and it would be boring. Then as I started reading the book I got more interested. I even stayed up late to finish the book.My favorite part is when Kunta is on the ship going to America. I felt so sad and couldn't believe someone would do such a thing.I felt so sorry for his mother and father. Also I would really recommend this book to others.
4 ||| I collect cookbooks and this one is very easy to read. The pictures are great and it is written in easy to understand terms. I use a gas grill myself and most of the recipes are adaptable to this type of grill. The hamburgers with butter is absolutely delicious and so are all of the chicken recipes that I have tried. I look forward to trying some of the seafood recipes. I would recommend this one!
2 ||| As an English and Special Education teacher I've found the Writers Inc. books to be a very helpful reference book for my students. However, the hardback versions are better organized and easier to find information than the softback. So, spend the few extra dollars...to get the better book.
4 ||| Purchase your copy of Mary Poppins before it goes in the Disney vault! This is a beautiful classic that young children will watch over and over again. When my youngest was in the hospital years ago, I used to sing him the songs from the movie as his IVs were being put in and it was the only thing that would soothe him. Highly recommend it for boys and girls 2 years old and up.
0 ||| I am an OAC student who has just completed this book. This fictional story is one of the most lethargic books I have ever read.The constant shift in tenses is confusing. And althought the book is tedious and uninteresting I believe the book has a alternate meaning perhaps one about life or what we should do with it. If you are planning to read this book I suggest cole's note's.
1 ||| I own the 2GB version of this drive. It is tiny, but still fits nicely into a USB port, but I have noticed a serious problem. The flash stick itself is actually smaller than the casing it is in (you can see it on the bottom). I have been very careful with how I store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from USB ports. Regardless, the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top, and the bottom corners of the plastic shell (that go into a USB port) have started snapping off in little chunks.
0 ||| Cook should stick to his area of expertise - Medicine in his books. This science fiction adventure lacks the deep analysis & understanding of a theme that makes his medical thrillers so interesting.
4 ||| I really loved this book. I do have to admit though, at the beginning I kept having to remind myself that the stories were going backward in time.I really do not love short stories, but this really attracted me, each story related to the one painting, and each story so connected. This is my first book by this author, she writes with such beauty and insight....I look forward to reading her others.
0 ||| WTF, I hate Simple Plan. The guitar player is fake and a poser. And the lead singer is definitely g@y, or his voice sounds VERY VERY g@y. I'm sick of g@y bands...avoid this like the plague.UPDATE: I noticed that under the "customers who bought this bought..." section, and found Jesse McCartney's "Beautiful Soul", and found that Simple Plan is THE PUNKEST PUNK RAWK BAND EVER, EVEN MORE PUNK THAN THE RAMONES, AC/DC, SYSTEM OF A DOWN, AND NINE INCH NAILS...lol, my sarcasm, but seriously, how is Simple Plan "punk" if their music related to Jesse McCartney's?
1 ||| The battery only stays charged for about an hour. Not sure if that's normal considering my old one died a quick death.
1 ||| Justin Timberlake's first solo album is, I have to say, a bit of a dissapointment. There is a few great tracks on this album but they are outwayed by the series of bland and sometimes annoying songs that make up the majority. The tracks that were released as singles, 'Like I love you', 'Cry me a River', and 'Rock your Body' are by far the best on the album, 'Rock your Body' actually being one of the best songs released by any artist in the past months, but unfortunity these tracks are the only highlights on the album. The exception to this is 'Take me Now', a collaberation with superstar Janet Jackson , which is a break from the HUm-Drum of most of the albums non released tracks.Overall, I would have to tell Justin to stick to his boy band day job.
1 ||| Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Plane crashes2. Anne Hathaway plays a grief counselor providing her services to the 5 survivors.3. She doesn't seem to be having much luck4. Against professional ethics, she gets involved with one of them5. People start dropping out of counseling6. It's probably because of her boring questions7. The so called twist is obvious more than half an hour before the end, but still they prolong and drag it out like pulling fingernails.8. If you've got a ticket to ride you'd be better off cashing it in.You can probably sleep through the first half of the movie after reading (1.) and (2.) above. Shortly after that, you'll see the twist. Wait ten minutes to confirm it, then go back to sleep until the credits start rolling.The entire cast sleepwalks their way through this dull drama, the punch line of which has been done before, and better.Amanda Richards, January 25, 2009
1 ||| The labeling on these disks were terrible!! When burned on itunes, there is no word on the titles that the disk is digitally remastered, which make you wonder if the music is really digitally remastered. Also, there was no artwork on either wish ou were here, and the dark side of the moon imersion sets. I know if you want you can manually do all that, but one would expect better than this from always-perfect Pink Floyd.
4 ||| "1984" is recognized to be one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, and helped to expose the evil that is contained in totalitarianism. The only fear is that in a post cold war existence we may fail to remember the lessons Orwell taught us, and unexpectedly in our complacency we may allow that evil to rise again.
1 ||| It is not a bad workout, but they repeat the same move too many times.I know some of Jillian and Billy Blank workout are annoying because they change moves too many times.But this one is just too boring to follow.What's up with her asking the man to move her step. She workout and has tons of muscle, can't even manage to move the step? come on...
0 ||| I bought this TV Jan 2, 2006 - it took 3 weeks to arrive, worked for 4 days, then died. Daewoo sent a technician over, which took another week. He told me it was a bad motherboard, that it would take a week to order (goodbye superbowl party). A week came and went, and he told me Daewoo didn't have the motherboard in stock and wouldn't give him a time frame for delivery of a replacement. Long story short, I had to fight to return it and to this day 2 months later still haven't been able to - I have a 5-foot paperweight in my living room.DAEWOO is HORRIBLE. Stay away from these incompetents.
3 ||| 3 years have past since i bought this item ans is still working excelent. it's small and practical, maybe not for industrial uses, just home use, but very usefull.the only thing I see that makes it 4 star and not 5 star, is that it would be better if it had temperature selector.another thing that would be better but its not a must have, its a glass cover, because the I forgot to take it the rubber cover off and it melted. but it's just a suggestion that does not interfere with the product's function.in general excellent product
2 ||| I read Uglies and could not wait for the sequel and after buying the book i am completly let down. The plot was not as well put together as the first book and the new characters did not add depth. Totally bogus no bubbly here...What really let me down was the ending a Special?? Not what i was expecting not in the least. But i won't say anymore to spoil it. If you read the first book then read the second but if you have not read the first then skip this series.
4 ||| Every part was helpful. The explanations gave me the background to understand the new ideas. The dialogue sections were easy and fun to read, and made each section crystal clear. The part I liked best, however, was the lists of "unhappy" beliefs that many people hold. I found many of my own beliefs on those lists and chose to change them. This one is my favorite of Kaufman's books.
0 ||| This monitor is nothing of what they promise. It doesn't work "plug-n-play", it crashes my PC when even after installing the proper drivers. The monitor doesn't even work on my Mac (which is usually forgiving of most faulty attachments). Don't waste your money or your time on this one.
0 ||| Although this book has some decent pictures the writing and analysis is below average. Writer appears more interested in underwater photography. His coverage of spearguns borders on the flimsy. He appears to have little actual experience in this area. Book is only 133 pages. 1. I saw no pictures of author with fish. 2. Written in third party format. Appears to be commercial diver or instructor. 3. Speargun coverage lightweight, knowledge of powerheads insufficient. Nothing on shark defense. 4. Seems to condone not using safeties on guns. 5. Does not use own equipment in book but refers to borrowed spearguns, etc.. 6. Appears to own little or none of his own spearing equipment. Written from the reporter, photographer point of view. I recommend looking elsewhere.
4 ||| I love this book. It really helped me to understand the power of thought and what can be done when you set your mind to things. It's quick to read and has been life-changing for not only me, but a number of other people. If you're looking for more information on how to bring more money and prosperity into your life, this is an excellent resource.
3 ||| Like many nerdy types, I've been interested in codes and ciphers since adolescence -- in my case, the mid-1950s. Being also a history junkie, in high school I read Chadwick's The Decipherment of Linear B, and in college, Tuchman's The Zimmerman Telegram, which confirmed my interest. (Both are covered here.) I picked up this book on a recommendation from a friend because of the accessible discussion of more recent topics, including "Pretty Good Privacy" and quantum cryptography, and while I found it necessary to skim lightly over some of the mathematical explanations, Singh's straightforward style and mastery of his subject made for an enjoyable weekend.
0 ||| this movie sucks it's hot topic retarded humor is the most annoying thing i've ever had to endure. tim burton sucks (batman was cool, so was mars attacks other than that he's retarded) he reminds me of red and black striped shirts, trenchcoats, and baggy bondage pants. if you're into being retarded you'll love this movie
2 ||| I should have stepped up one notch. The sub doesn't have much punch (again you get what you pay for) but the two speakers themselves are alright.It's not that I'm dissatisfied, it's just that I was considering this set or the Logitech x-230 and chose this one based on some other reviews and to save a few bucks. Now that they've arrived I'll be able to live with them just fine ---- still, if I were to do this again I would spend the few extra dollars for better speakers.
2 ||| Great to finally have the film in my collection, although special effects were more impressive to me at it's time of release. Definately a keeper though.Love the Nudy bits.
3 ||| This is a good receiver for the money and I purchased it after doing a fair amount of research. However, if you are going to use this with HDMI be warned that the unit 'clicks' quite a few times as it negotiates the proper HDMI signal from the component to the TV. For example, when playing a Blu-Ray movie using a PS3 the unit will typically 'click' about 8 times before the movie kicks in... this is NOT the fault of the PS3. The click is the sound of the internal hardware relay... pretty bad design in my opinion but everything else works as advertised... not sure if I'm going to keep the unit, but I will give it 4 stars as it does what it advertises to do.
4 ||| This book was of a great help explaining the death of our children's papa. All creatures/things have a life cycle. The illustrations were beautiful. Easily explainable to children.
3 ||| Sargent Todd (Kurt Russel) never had a life of his own, till he was tossed out with the space garbage because they thought he was dead...being alone is not a handicap for a one man army like Todd as long as fighting is involved, its all that other stuff that can be painful. Good action, the opening training and battle sequences are wonderful, and when it suddenly switches to lasers and spacesuits instead of fatigues, you get that Forever War feeling. All's well that ends with a nuke, must have for Kurt Russel fans and Those Who Can Never Go Home Again. I'm rooting for a sequel.
4 ||| I was starting to lose interest and faith in the whole romance thing. Everything was getting so cliche, but Susan Elizabeth Phillips has given me a new reason for straining my eyes!!! I could not put this book down. After I was finished reading it (in under 6 hours) I read it all over again. Ms. Phillips has the wit that I have been missing. With this book I have been introduced to many leisure nights of love and humor. I'm already making room on my shelf for her other books!!!
1 ||| I was expecting great things from this set of rather expensive earphones.Their high end performance is quite good.The bass performance is somewhere between very bad to non-exitant even when adding equalizer boost,STAY AWAY FROM THIS MODEL!!
4 ||| this is a perfect tribute to the greatest and most evergreen bands of all time.... throughout thier career, Metallica have made music that they love, not bothering about the current market likes and dislikes....... this is another example of just that. They have a happy knack doing something that's refreshing. This is pretty much he ultimate album for all Metallica faithfulls and a starting block for those who're not too much into heavy metal.
3 ||| Heard of the new Resident Evil for the PS2 and got all excited, then I played it. Graphics are good but not the greatest in the series. There is no storyline what so ever, no explination or backstory on any charater, but the killer of this game is the horrible loading times. It felt like i spent more time in loading screens than in actually game play. Do your self a favor and rent it first, like I thankfully did and will pass up buying this game, and wait for the, what i hope to be far better Resident Evil 4.
1 ||| This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student, this book will confirm what he or she already knows and may add a few additional touches to personal trouble spots. For the average to poor student, it may be hard to get past the school marmish tone to get to "the goods" this book has to offer. I'm afraid in today's environment, this book won't reach those who need it the most.
3 ||| I got this product today and was first impressed by how sturdy it felt. Assembly consisted of screwing on the legs. My only complaint is that the stools are more suited to younger kids -- they are kind of short. However, my 6yo told me he loves it.I believe this table is best suited to 3-5 year olds.
4 ||| Read this and you'll come to know why Gabriel's Genesis was so good live act. Theatrical shows, fascinating customs and proge music that touched many people. Those were the days before the great success. In my opinion, Gabriel's year were Genesis greatest for musically. Many pictures and interesting stories will reveal you many interesting things for band members. Highly recommand for every Genesis fan!
1 ||| Book was in ok condition. Boring read though. The stories were told then updated then updated again I wouldn't re-read.
3 ||| Even in their less succesful films, the Coen brothers never fail to deliver something interesting. TMWWT-their latest film, and areturn to the neo-noir territory of Blood Simple-is no exception. Even though it goes slightly off the rails in the last twenty minutes, the film is full of the entertaining oddballs one expects from them. The book is the shooting script, which upon first read doesn't appear to have any deviations from the finished film, along with a three page introduction by their film editor, Roderick Jaynes, in which he discusses the genesis of the title. Good reading for aspiring screen (and other) writers.
3 ||| This CD contains a satisfying selection of Peggy Lee's more popular songs. The insert is straightforward with some good pictures of the singer at various points throughout her career, and detailed production information about each song. I would have liked to see some interesting tidbits/trivia about the singer herself . . . and also printed lyrics.
0 ||| Whathafyuckisthissheeit?I figured if I wrote it like that the kiddies who buy this won't understand. People who listen to this obviously don't understand much. I mean, honestly. If they did grasp reality, they wouldn't be listening to Gorilleez to begin with. And that would make this whole review irrelevant. But that doesn't much matter.And neither does this cd. Nor you, reading this, probably.Or all my negative ratings. So there you go. But what does matter? Good things matter. Character. Honesty. Being yourself. The Higher Power.Gorilleez don't offer any of this worthwhile stuff. No matter how much cable TV tries to tell you otherwise. Then again, you all won't believe me. Shee!t, you probably don't even understand me.And there we go, back to the beginning. A perfect circle? No. I'd say more in the vague shape of a limp biscuit.Piece out, and hope you put it together,D.S.Rise
1 ||| I only downloaded this for my husband. He liked it, but I thought it was extra boring. I couldn't follow it, and I totally hated the flying man with boils on his face.
3 ||| This is one of those books that is still around becauseit fills a niche that no modern book has been ableto fill. It introduces N=1 susy quickly and concisely.The reader must work through every equation in orderto get something out of this book. The reason why peoplecontinue to use this book of equations is because theequations are right. If you try other books, they arefilled with typos and sometimes even more serious errors.Get through the first 8 chapters of this bookmay be chapter 22 and 24 then get into Argyres' notesthat delve into the modern aspects of supersymmetricquantum field theory.
0 ||| So annoying ever time my kids pull the tape out they want me to wind it back up. Boring toy, stupid not worth the money
4 ||| This is one of the all time favorites to add to your children's library. It is an especially great selection to read to children at bedtime. A wonderful selection for children having difficulty going to sleep at night.
0 ||| I needed this for a college class. I have Homework from this book this week and I ordered it 13 days ago/ When will this be shipped???????
2 ||| After reading reviews of the vtech and other similar 2.4Ghz products I had many concerns. At the store, the sales person was very negative about Siemens(sp?) and suggested vtech. As others have pointed out, the vtech is very good looking and has many features. It does not have the range of a 900 mhz DSS. In side by side comparison and with the vtech plugged into various locations, the vtech would reach about 100 ft outside the house while the 900 would reach over 200 ft. If range is your primary cocern this is not the phone for you. Otherwise, the phone performs well around the house. There is a very minor back-ground hiss regardless of location. Despite the warnings I ended up putting the base close to my computer - same circuit and phone jack. It seems to work as well there as other locations.
3 ||| My friend complained bitterly to me how horrible this book was, and curious, I decided to pick up a copy. I was impressed by Bronte's work.. I like how she illustrates the passion and love evident between Cathy and Heathcliff... it is one of the most moving storylines I've read. It's a good classic, and although it's tragic, there are glimpses of happiness here and there in the novel, and the novel ends on a peaceful, concluding note.However, the Yorkshire accent nearly killed me... it was hard to read--I skipped the Yorkshire dialogues almost completely. Also I felt like strangling Cathy and Heathcliff... it was all perfect, but then she had to go do her thing... Yes, I know this was the whole point of the story--conflict--but still, it could have been happier. The novel was very touching and I was left speechless as I quietly closed the book, because Ms. Bronte knows how to describe two people in fervent (though at times.. rampant?) love and how it will endure the tests of time.
1 ||| Tried to use FujiFilm 1GB xD cards, type M, doesn't recognize them. Still trying to resolve situation with Lexar, they say that despite package claim of xD compatibility another reader model RW023 is needed.
3 ||| I and my Husband go to Jamaica every 7-9 months so we love to pick up special things like this or Blue Mountain coffee each and every time. We recently ran out of all of our frozen goodies so we got these. We are normally creatures of habit but figured this would be a good way to try other flavors. Some of them (that I wasn't used to) seem extra rum infused than other and the "flavor" of each one wasn't as strong as I would have liked but they are still yummy. If you LOVE rum though; you will LOVE these.
4 ||| It's a Wonderful Life has been broadcast on television more often than nearly any other film in history. And yet, even having seen it as many times as I have, it still touches me when I see it. After a lapse in seeing it each year, I watched it last year while wrapping gifts, and smiled and cried my way through it on DVD. The video quality is as crisp on DVD as anyone could hope. There are some special features included on this edition, but the film alone is worth getting the DVD. Presented in it's original 1.33 (Full Screen) aspect ratio.
3 ||| Works great in my Nikon D-80. Very fast as far as I can tell (faster than the speed I shoot photos at least). Would have been nice if it came with plastic protective case to fit into my photo bag (just comes in small clamshell that is hard to open - you need scissors to open). It would be nice if manufacturers got rid of clamshells for internet sales. No shrink issues on line, so all this packaging does is annoy customers.
2 ||| It has been used at least 4 hours total so far. But, it still makes strong rubber burning smell. Other than that, It works fine. The handle is really cool and easy to grep.
2 ||| Overall this is a decent biography, not great but readable.The author seems to have a problem as to whether he is writing about Mark Twain or trying to imitate Mark Twain and I find his numerous "humorous" side comments irritating.Also it is evident that he tries to put Twain and his work in the context of the time, but he does so in a very superficial way.He is too much of a cheerleader as another reviewer said and his book reminds me too much of a a Hollywood biography than a serious study of his work and life.
2 ||| Street Trash has a lot of hype. and for good reason. lots of great over the top effects and explosions. some good toilet humor and a great nuts bad guy. drags on at parts, the ending is too quick, but if you like dirty hobo's, farts, and melting faces (and who the hell doesn't), then this is a must.
1 ||| My daughter opened up some presents just shortly after midnight on Christmas Day. One of them was the DVD I ordered called "James and the Giant Peach". The DVD box did NOT contain the DVD, it was just an empty box. We are very disappointed with this and will not be ordering from Amazon anymore. This product was sold as NEW (which obviously is a complete lie). BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! DON'T TRUST THE WORD "NEW" ON ANYTHING ON THIS SITE.
2 ||| I have read all of Lori Fosters books and I have to admit this one did not impress me. I did like story of Annie and Guy, it was romantic and cute. However, Messing around with Max was rediculous and unrealistic. I didn't even care for the dog in this story and I love dogs! Would suggest you buy this book only if you can get it real cheap! If not don't waste your money!! Spend it on Lori's other books that deserve five stars!
4 ||| I was planning to apply them on curtains. But the curtains ended up so pretty that I don't have to add anything. However, I have applied appliqu√©s on the toy box. It looks very nice....
4 ||| The title speaks for itself.I have been brewing beer, making wine and beer for over 20 years. I still pull this book out as a referance, on a regular basis. Don't brew without this book.Dave
4 ||| Do you think I'm crazy? I think you're crazy too. So is 70 Minutes in Hell, a German home recording made in 1969 of Charles Bukowski. What makes this so compelling is that nobody can read Bukowski like Bukowski.Buk's 60-plus books offer a glimpse into the world of horse tracks, seedy bars, and sleazy LA rooming houses. 70 Minutes in Hell, with its haphazard recording (replete with comments to the German dude making the recording and the sound of traffic passing by) gives us some insight into the world of an aloof, desperate and drunken man disinterested in the normalities of society.Regardless whether you're an insomniac, a narcoleptic or none of the above, if you're a Buk fan you need to listen.
4 ||| eareit is awesome!!!!!!!!there are 22 exciting events. you can pick your own car and track.my little brother plays it a lot,and so have I.I love this game and so will you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 ||| Ms. Eschenburg takes the arranged-marriage plot device but doesn't really give it anything new. The "hero" really isn't that likable, and spends half the novel apart from the heroine. They end up together, but the reader is left wondering "why?" The author attempts to fill up the lack of real romance by setting the story against the American Civil War, but makes some mistakes with that as well, and child sexual abuse just flat does not belong in a romance novel AT ALL. That chapter nearly made me lose my lunch and it really didn't add anything to the plot. Not the worst "romance" I've ever read by any means, but definitely not worth the cover price. Buy used.
3 ||| i read this book because of the acclaim it received from my fellow teen readers, the only critics whose reviews i will acknowledge. they said that i would be able to relate to Holden, and that his cyncism and bitterness would be familiar to me. from this description, i expected an intelligent, profound, thoughtful character who was misunderstood by the rest of the world, and frustrated by the lack of understanding he was getting from those around him. holden did not fit this description-actually i did not find him to be intelligent at all. but i think what makes the book so amusing and thought-provoking IS holden's immaturity. the reader is not threatened by him, since his character has a humorous pretentious quality that is endearing and not bothersome. the book didn't cause any deep questions and about the meaning of life to arise, but instead provided a succint, comical, and thoughtful celebration of teenage existence and the thought process of the undeveloped mind.
2 ||| This is NOT the definative Billy Joel one might want. While it contains a lot of his hits, it skips many others, like Top 10 hits You May Be Right, You're Only Human, Modern Woman, A Matter Of Trust, and I Go To Extremes, along with others that made the Top 20. In place of the big hits, we get drivel such as Scandinavian Skies, New York State of Mind, and Goodnight Saigon. That said, why did I buy this one? To get the edited single/radio versions of Piano Man, My Life, Just The Way You Are, We Didn't Start The Fire, and All About Soul. If you're like me, you'll need this CD for that reason alone. Now, if we could just get a volume 2 containing the missing pieces (in their single edits....please), I'll be very happy.
0 ||| I have to read this book for my English 4 AP class, and am so far highly disappointed and confused! What is the purpose of this book. It's another Alice in the Wonderland yet much more confusing!
3 ||| This album took a few listens to get the feel down, now it is in heavy rotation in my car CD player.As usual CC turns out catchy hooks and meaningful lyrics.My favorite song on this album is "Black and Blue". It's perfect for anyone who has just had enough, and is giving up.
0 ||| That this book is considered important is an indictment of the law school community. Labored writing, weak analysis, all combined with a fatuous tone.
2 ||| Russell Crowe, Academy Award winner for Gladiator, turns out that he can pull of a non-epic just as well. In this film he plays a slightly disturbed KNR (Kidnap and Ransom) Officer that gets assigned to a small case dealing with a worker building a dam for an oil company. David Morse plays the captive, stolen right out of his car in Tecala. Meg Ryan plays his disoriented wife that puts all of her faith in Crowe's character. The movie is slow at times. Fast at others. It opens with a great action scene, and people looking for an action movie will not be dissapointed. It was a compelling film and the acting by Crowe, Morse, Ryan, and the long time forgotten David Caruso (who gives the best role in his career). You have to check this one out.
2 ||| This is an odd offshoot. Almost like a partial re-boot of the series. It starts back at the beginning of the series and it is as different as it as the same. The look and feel of the TV series is very important and this cartoon changes that. Sam is voiced by the actor, but Dean is not, so the brothers interactions seem off. The look of the chars is significantly different too, so that is jarring. I think if you like japanese anime, understand that it is their version of Supernatural not the Americanized series, you will be OK. If you don't, you will hate it. I have not decided if I will watch the whole series. I am tempted because I love Supernatural and would like to see some more of the brothers and their encounters but I will have to wrap my mind around the changes in order to enjoy this offering.
0 ||| I wish I had read the reviews before buying this! One reviewer already pointed out that this is the exact same workout as Cardio Dance Fusion, just with a different cover and title. I am disappointed that The Firm is so openly dishonest, greedy, and eager to fool their customers.
4 ||| I first heard this group on the radioio eclectic webstream. The song was "Fall Stories." I noticed over the course of a month or so that every time that the song came on that I paid more attention to it. They have marvelous melodies that you just wished you could hear more of in mainstream music. I found their website and listened to their album. After one listen I ordered the CD and awaited its arrival. I thought they reminded me very much of the early Indigo Girls. Later on I joined their fan club in the hope they might eventually visit somewhere nearby. They are now signed on to the Indigo Girls record label so I hope there is enough marketing power behind them that they get to make a new album. The only weak song on the album is the remake of George Harrison's "My Sweet Lord." It isn't bad, but just not as great as all the other songs.
4 ||| "Dick" is a hilarious look at the famous Watergate scandal seen through the eyes of two bubbly high school girls. In the movie the two girls (Kirsten Dunst from movies like "Drop Dead Gorgeous" and her latest the adaption of Jeffrey Eugandes' "The Virgin Suicides" and Michelle Williams from teleivision's "Dawson's Creek") are the infamous Watergate whistleblower known only as "Deep Throat". I really thought that this was a great, original idea, which makes this film so unlike any other teen movie out there. If you're looking for a funny, smart, and endearing romp, get "Dick"!
3 ||| My sexual preferance is streight, but i'm a DJ/MC i like to dance, girls with GLITZ, and i am ashamed to admit i like smooth disco dance sounds, and i like to mix-up my music with new sounds, So if you can admit to your audio perversion, like me, it is not great art but it is fun. so grab that foxy lady hit the floor,bounce it,bump your stuff, swing your load, is's ok to have some fun, really, you only go this way once, it's your dance...you do it! fun='s no hang ups. that said, enjoy Liberty X's smooth dance sounds.
1 ||| The only reason this book is selling is because of the Cyril Wecht name. There was no new information in the book. All the stated information was already published in other publications. Disapppointed to read something already read....Save your $5.00!!
1 ||| My little 10 pound dog completely destroyed this toy in just a few minutes. She had the squeeker out and then shredded the body. Only the ropes survived. Now we just have expensive rope toys left.
3 ||| It has a big field of view and installed very easily onto my bicycle handle. Just make sure you have a hold at the end of your bicycle bar and it will install. Comes with two inserts. My mountain bicycle used the bigger of the two. You stick it into the handle bar and keep twisting the allen wrench until it expands inslde the handle bars and has a nice tight fit. I seem to have to adjust it everytime I go for a ride but I do bump it a lot. I can ride through the neighborhood and easily see anything approaching behind me with this. Well worth for the piece of mind it provides.
0 ||| I bought the book because I think it is of the latest edition (edition 9?). But obviously, it is not, although it is printed in 2008.Amazon should specify the edition of the book!
3 ||| This film, like many others, shows why Daniel Day-Lewis is a master of his trade. I had no problem suspending disbelief that he was truly a boxer. This was even evident during the opening credits when he was shadow boxing in the prison yard. But this wasn't a movie about boxing; it's a movie about the love between two people that endured a decade and a half apart. I don't know anything about cameras and the types of film used to shoot movies, but the actual look of the film was perfect for a torn up Northern Ireland. It also captures the changing mind-set from extreme to cooperative by those resisting change when they realize that extremism will never lead to a favorable conclusion. So there's a couple different themes, all tied together to make a good movie. On a sidenote - I literally had to buy this movie because I could not find it in a video rental store anywhere ... does anyone know why?
0 ||| Ok so I opted for this one since it had the vibration. Bad choice the plastic broke on the 1st use. Should have bought the cheaper non vibrating metal one. Hindesite is 20/20.
0 ||| This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read.
4 ||| This is no deviation. This is the realization of what they were trying to do with previous albums. The Blues Explosion has always been about being bombastic and ridiculous, poking fun at the id of rock, which is the id of music, and thus embodying it. Distilled swagger, more image less substance. What has less substance, more image, and more swagger than samples and layered production?The lyrics are the album's real strength, coherent without sacrificing the band's chaos, the best of any Blues Explosion album. Nothing profound or particularly original, just simple rock themes distorted through the Explosion's filter.Have been burning all my CDs to the massive HD lately; few albums get more than 3-5 songs burned. This one gets 12. BTW,if you ever have the opportunity, this band is one of the best live bands around.
1 ||| Being an old classic rock fan, it took me years to finally decide to purchase Grand Hotel. Well my memory of the LP back from the day was obscured due to too much weed and expectation.Boy was I happy with the recording and the quality music in this CD. It was fantastic, needless to say anymore. Bringing home the bacon , Fall from Grace are Classic songs that should gain more playing time on Sirius Radio. How come?I would love to be Procol personal publicist and spread the word to all the naysayers out there stuck on Zepellin. Try it , you'll like it.
2 ||| We started using this at the beginning of May. We are a Bichon Frise and Toy Poodle. About a month later we can definitely see the results. It needs to be used every day for three months, and we are off to a good start. We'll have to wait and see what happens after three months. Hopefully all our brown tear stains will be completely gone. After three months, it needs to be used four times a week for a while, then once a week. We will update our review once the three month period has been completed.
0 ||| I'd love to tell you about this soup, but most of the noodles slipped right past the flimsy lid while draining. I'm sure it can be done if I hold the lid at the very end, but that's where the hot water comes out. If the manufacturer can't bother to make a usable package, I can't bother with the product. Too bad there is no '0' option.
1 ||| I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books. And while Rainbow Six is not necessarily a bad read, it has some very lame aspects to it. The plot is so far fetched and downright offensive toward environemtalists it scares me. Also, Clancy's writing is incredibly repetitive at times. He uses the word "niggardly" 3 times in 20 pages. And he uses the analogy "as regularly as he zips up his pants" a couple of times. What the hell kind of writing is this? I was laughing at how bad some of the writing was. But on a side note some of the action sequences are cool, but again it kind of wears old after 700 pages. I wish Clancy would stop trying to showcase his extrememly conservative views through his novels. Tom, this is your readers here, WE DON'T CARE. You may be a good writer, but as a person you seem to be a total jerk. Get back to your old self and keep it real next time.
4 ||| This book has two things which good book needs: first, it's a work of extremely talanted man, second, it's a book of a person with which you'll never agree. Voltaire was one who talked about bad taste of Shakespeare, but his taste is really extremely bad. When you begin to read this book, you think it to be a work of honest man, but in the middle of it you see that he was just a tricky politician. But it all just adds fun to the reading.
0 ||| Shuffler Is inexpensive and that's the only good thing about it. You get what you pay for. Works some of the time, with limited cards in it. Usually doesn't shuffle both sides, ONLY ONE! What good is that?
4 ||| Funny man Leslie Nielson is superbly classy in this offtake of another "Dracula" film. His humor & one lines will keep you laughing continually in this spoof & with Mel Brooks Harvey Korman actors who compliment him its a must buy.
3 ||| This adapter worked well in all areas of travel throughout the UK. However, as mentioned in other reviews, when plugging a 3-pin US plug into the back of the adapter, the round grounding pin of the US plug doesn't fit into the rectangular hole of the adapter. Having read several reviews which confirmed that this problem could be circumvented with some effort, I purchased the product. It required significant effort to plug in/unplug my US plug the first time used; with subsequent uses the plastic cover adopted a rounder shape, although it remains a struggle.I hope that the manufacturer's address what appears to be a design flaw.
0 ||| Save your money and your time. I recommend leaving this potshot at the Native American non-fiction genre in the pile of unread books next to the rest of the myth-and-legend creation stories written and edited by "white" authors where it belongs. The problem is not Fuller's overambitious and sometimes nonsensical prose, the lack of basic evidence to support much of what he deems factual within the text itself, or the fact that Fuller himself presents fuzzy portrait of the man he is trying to recognize. The words of Yellowhorse himself are absent from this book; in that emptiness, there is little left that furthers the recognition of the integrity of Native Peoples in history, aside from that which has been outlined being of great importance in conventional, non-Native society.
2 ||| This film is low-budget. The acting is not good, but the story is quite good - if you can stomach the incestuous over-tones; the father returns after a long abscence to put the bite on one daughter, than another (who has a lesbian lover), as well he 'infects' his wife, son, and then puts the bite on his pregnant daugter-in-law (the 'bite' is more implied - we see the results).It can be off-putting because of this and a few other disturbing sequences, but the scene of two daughters, the lesbian lover, the mother all sharing blood is quite interesting - a family feast.
3 ||| The Witch Has an Itch is a terrific kids book for Halloween. It isn't scary and there is no blood and guts and actually has a moral - type ending. The witch likes to do mean things and when she does, different parts of her body itch until she realizes that she should make good ,not bad. It is a nice repetative book and lends itself to many language activities.
3 ||| To own one of (IMHO) the essential books on modern logic and philosophy for FREE is fantastic. It is thick going at times, but that's philosophy for you. Any easier and it would likely be the baloney which passes for logic nowadays. One curious omission is any title information beyond the name, I.e. Year of publication (1912).
2 ||| This is just a no-brainer movie meant to entertain. YES, the FX are pretty bad. YES, the plot is something that a monkey with a typewriter could do. SURE, the acting reeks and the swearing and sex scene and gut-splattering violence are exatterated. It's not even close to the original King Kong, but it's a fun movie anyway.
2 ||| Yup, that's it..great couple of effects...used entirely too much. A good watch the first time....but not something to watch over and over.
2 ||| Does an OK job opening bottles, but is hard on your fingers (because it's so thin) and if you're not careful will slip off and cut the inside of your finger on the bottle cap. On the plus side, it is cool looking, low profile, and doesn't bulk up your keychain. I'd buy it again, but understand the limitations.
3 ||| come sempre i walkabouts riescono a dare quella saggezza alla musica che non guasta mai, quella dolcezza che fa lacrimare i cuori piu deboli....gran bel disco...viva i walkabouts
4 ||| This book is an excellent follow-up to Hinds Feet on High Places. The reader followes Much-Afraid, now Grace-and-Glory on her continued mission: to bring her family into the service of the Shepard. A definate must read for those who have read the above book, if for nothing else, to give direction and encouragement with their new life in Christ.
1 ||| Ordered this album because I am a fan of Bob Dylan's music. The first copy I received had the spindle hole punched off center. This resulted in a few of the tracks skipping, you could see the needle wobbling back and forth. I got an exchange through Amazon (great return service), and the second one I received had the same problem. I am about to return the second copy. This record was a nice heavy pressing and sounded good on the tracks that played properly, I guess they just had a bad run at the factory. I have seen similar complaints about other records this factory has made.
0 ||| I have purchased over 100 dolars on science projects from smithsonian institute to teach my six grader, these were a waste of money, they are all nothing but toddler toys, upon receiving them we though we would give it a try anyway, now I regret not returning all of them right away. We barely used them sincce my son is a six grader and these are for kinder garden science projects.
2 ||| I have the DVD Anthology from the some years ago and "I Am The Walrus" has a TRUE stereo ending.It's like that on "Love" and even The Beatles Rock Band.What in the hell happened? I've waited all this time for something good to happen and,well...
2 ||| Maybe I should've caught on that it was a HP product, it would not work with my mac. Due to that fact I don't know how it really comes out once installed.
4 ||| This book left off at a cliff hanger leaving the reader to thirst for more. I would recommend this book for people seeking a good thriller.
0 ||| In my case, the idea of pregnancy was a little scary at first, so I bought this book in order to be as well informed as I could... the results were: a whole week crying in desperation and fear that all those awful things could happen to me at once, and the urge to burn the book in the fireplace at the first opportunity.Another thing that gave me shivers was the authors' obsession with the nearly demonic effects of eating refined sugar. It seems that all problems in pregnancy are caused by sugar... It's amazing to think how millions of women throughout the decades have had so many kids and are still alive, in spite of their sinful sugar consumption.Luckily, I have understanding people around me who eased off my mind from the horrors of pregnancy. Now I am prepared to enjoy every stage of this awesome part of my life. With another book, of course.
2 ||| this was a good book, but when i got to the end there really wasnt anything like a climax. it was the same feeling throughout the whole book and then it just ended. not even a good ending.nothing happened
2 ||| I really enjoy this author, and I enjoyed the story. Unfortunately, the grammatical issues and spelling errors in some cases make some parts of the reading annoying. The story did keep me guessing, and I did enjoy the suspense of it all.
3 ||| My preschool age daughter loves board games, but I can only take so much of Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, or Hi Ho Cherry-O. Max is so much better than the "regular" board games you find at stores like Target. The objective of this game is to get the squirrel, mouse, and bird to safety before the cat Max gets to them. You roll the dice to determine if Max moves or the little creatures move. When Max gets too close, you can call him back to the starting point for a treat. Kids and adults can work together to try to get the little creatures to safety. My preschool age daughter has no trouble figuring out the rules and she enjoys calling Max back for a treat. Like I mentioned before, some preschool games get old real quick for adults, but Max is entertaining for all ages. The only complaint that I have is that the pieces are made of cardboard paper. I think it would be more appealing and durable if they have little plastic figures for the animals.
3 ||| This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.
3 ||| This is a beautiful story, told from the perspective of twelve-year old Patty, who is ready to see more than her parents can show her of love, and yes, at her age, of romance. Patty is loveably brave with her tooth-and-nail grit, but Greene never loses sight of the vulnerability of being twelve-years old. There is one awkwardly written scene, in which Anton is a bit too self-congratulatory for really having risked nothing, but overall, this book shows a different kind of Nazi soldier than the stock characters, and it shows heart.
1 ||| I bought this product a few months ago. It worked at the first 1-2 months, and then it did not stick together with skin any more. I was quite disappointed the quality of this tape.
3 ||| Good product that been around for years, I learned off this tool when I was a kid and know my multiplication by heart thanks to this and I am 31 years old 9x9= and I know with out thinking its 81 for example no need to count in my head, this is about rememorization of numbers. Just now days kids want everything electronic so it may be tuff for some kids to learn off, like my 10 year old daughter.
4 ||| hey this movie is one of the best who movies out there. The performance is amazing. pete and roger are on top of their game as is ringos son as drummer!they do all the classic who songs and pete still drops the f bombs a couple of times. but i still totally say you should buy it.
1 ||| This is a french book. French books are, of course, often french, but this one is frencher than most. Ah, Pierrot! Reading this fine french book makes me the sad clown of life. Could Voltaire be any frencher, you ask? I doubt it. I am a sad clown, I say. Even when he criticizes the French he does so in a, how do you say, french way. Oui, oui! So come, bring along your Jerry Lewis video tapes and we will read this very french book together. It is frencher than a Quebecer at a Steisand concert. Frencher than Little Richard at an amfAR banquet. Frencher than Richard Simmons at a french pride parade. Read Candide and you too can be a very french sad clown. Sacre Bleu!!!
3 ||| but why be so lousy and do not add at least english subtitles? would have worthed full five stars, but without subtitles the viewer is left at the mercy of the actors, not always so clear in their speaking!
4 ||| I took my kids to the movie at the theatre but I think I bought the video for me! I find myself watching this movie more than they do. This is a great story of triumph. The animation is fantastic. A must see for all ages!!!!!!!
3 ||| This band surprised me at first with the viral internet music video of "Here It Goes Again" (the treadmill video). I decided to look into them a bit more, and got the album Oh No. The songs like Television, Television, and It's a Disaster, show the talent in this band, not only in the music itself but in the lyrics. Their older album that is self-titled, is great as well. My recommendation...get them both.
0 ||| Not for the gun range. I had to add standard range ear protection over these ear plugs. The only benefit to these plugs are the ease of placement and removal.
3 ||| I'm soo glad Brian Jacques wrote the story of Martin. This heroic tale is the fabrick of dreames. The author did a wonderfull job writting it so eliquintly. A impossible book to put down, I was near to getting a detention for reading it in class. Martin the warrior's tale is sure to remain on my list of all-time favorites. I highly recomend it to all ages!
